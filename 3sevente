  .... and so narrowly averted disaster.\nThere we are, Yeoman, everything neatly
  written up and recorded.\n\n.aa YEOMAN\nBut how did things turn out in the end?
  \ Did the Winkle\nregain control of the government?  Was Brassiere ousted and\nMatilda
  suitably chastised?  Or did the Munchkins decide\nthat the People's Bilingual Daily
  Gazette had been right\nall along and that they needed someone other than the\nWinkle
  as their leader?  Was any of the pages that you\nfound the true one?  And where
  are the Boobies - still\ndown on the planet or did we bring them back on board?
  \ \nThere's nothing about any of this in the records.\nWhat really happened?\n\n.je\nWell,
  Yeoman, perhaps we could go down to my quarters\nwhere we would have the privacy
  to discuss matters\nat some length.  (HE PUTS HIS ARM AROUND HER.)\nYou see, once
  we had escaped from the death trap that\nthe Munchkins had sprung on us there in
