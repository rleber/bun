  OVER\nTHE DESK IS SOME RED RIBBON (AS IN RED TAPE). THE DOG-EARED PAGE ENTERS.\nSHE

  page. Spotty,\nJock and Officer Knightly are in rough shape.\nA page brings Tom
  Brzustowskabil a document to read.  As he does\nso Ensign Tolstoy comes in.  They
  exchange some casual banter.\n\n(AT THIS POINT TOLSTOY ENTERS FOLLOWING THE RED
  RIBBON.\nTOM LOOKS UP AT THE NOISE HE IS MAKING,\nTHEN STANDS UP AND OFFERS HIS
  HAND WHICH TOLSTOY SHAKES)\n\n.to\nHello. I'm Ensign Tolstoy of the starship Satirize,
  its five-year-\n\n.tb\nI've read all that, Ensign. (PATS DOCUMENT)\nI'm Tom Brzustowskabil
  of the mountain of red tape - V.P.\n\n.to\nYes, I've been following the tape.  What's
  the V.P. stand for?\n\n.tb\nVox populi.\n\n.to\nOh, the sailor man!\n\n.tb\n(LOOKS
  EXASPERATED)\nYou misunderstand. You know, you talk sort of funny.  I think\nyou
  should take the Munchkinese Proficiency Test.\n\n(TOM RUSHES TOLSTOY AROUND HIS
  DESK AND SITS HIM IN THE CHAIR,\nPLACING A PIECE OF PAPER IN FRONT OF HIM. TOLSTOY
  PROTESTS\nFEEBLY)\n\nNow all you have to do is write a paragraph describing the
  conflict\nbetween quality and quantity of energy.\n\n.to\n(TALKING WHILE WRITING)\nWell,
  let's see:\n.nf\n.in+5\nThe quantity of energy is not sustained,\nIt droppeth as
  the gentle silicon from heaven\nUpon the place beneath-\n\n.in8\n.fi\n.tb\nThat's
  enough.  You flunk.\n\n.to\nBut why......\n\n.tb\n     ***************************************\n

  \    From reading one verse?\n.tb\n     The prose is wordy,\n.to\n     Pur-ty,\n.tb\n
  \    Excruciating,\n.to\n     Fascinating.\n     I can't adore it more!\n.tb\n     I
  just abhor it, for\n     It's too verbose.\n.to\n     No, it's terse.\n\n     I
  think your taste smells.\n.tb\n     I think yours does, too.\n.to\n     A monkey
  that spells\n     Has more class than you.\n.tb\n     I don't think you will\n     Make

  You dance well.\n\n.to\n(SPOKEN) Thank you, so do you.\n\n     Some men can\n     Do
  a Highland fling, even as they sing.\n     They can jump about, cut a caper.\n.tb\n
  \    Wiggle as they do, even hootchy-coo,\n     Seem as if they're walking on air.\n.to\n
  \    Jump up, turn around, get the rhythm down,\n     Let the music flow through
  your booties.\n.aa BOTH\n     Our English tastes differ, but what do we care\n.tb\n
  \    When we can\n     Dance, take a stance, given half a chance\n     To perform
  with all of our prowess.\n.to\n     Tap our toes a bit, then our English lit\n     Doesn't
  really need to impress.\n.aa BOTH\n     Friend, comrade or droogie,\n     A man
  who can boogie\n     's A man who's sure of suc-\n.tb\n     Free yourself from all
  distress.\n.aa BOTH\n     Yes, we're sure of suc-\n.to\n     Glad we straightened
  up this mess.\n.aa BOTH\n     Yes, we're sure of suc-\n     One more time now with
  finesse.\n     Yes, we're sure of success!\n\n(TOLSTOY AND TOM RETURN ARM IN ARM
  TO THE DESK)\n\n.to\nReally, though, that's not a fair test.\n\n.tb\nWhat do you
  mean?\n\n.to\nIt doesn't relate to my cultural heritage.\n\n.tb\nWhat do you want
  us to do, give you the test in Russian?\n\n.to\nRussian - smussian! I'm from the
  wilds of the North Campus.\n\n.tb\nOh, my God.\n\n.aa VOICE\nYes?\n\n.tb\nNothing,
  Burt - just a slip of the tongue.\n\n.aa VOICE\nWell, watch it! This is long distance
  from Florida.\n\n.tb\nYes, sir. (TO TOLSTOY) Now, as I was saying, you'll have to
  take remedial \nMunchkin until you get rid of that outrageous accent.\n\n.to\nWhat
  accent?\n.ul\nI\ndon't have an accent,\n.ul\nyou\nhave an accent.\n\n.tb\nShhhh!\n.ul\nHe\n(GESTURES
  UPWARDS) may be listening.\n\n.to\nOh, sorry.\n\n.tb\nNow just give me your ID number
  and I'll see that you're\nenrolled in Remedial Munchkin 101.\nThat's 6:30 'till
  noon Tuesday and R-day. (ASIDE) R-day...\nI used to know what R was.\n\n.to\nBut
  I don't have a number!\n\n.tb\nWhat do you mean?\n\n.to\nI'm not a student.\n\n.tb\nOh,
  no, not another Student Council Presidential Candidate!\n\n.to\nNo, sir - I'm looking
  for a page.\n\n.tb\nOh. (PAUSE) Here's a page: a title page.\n\n.to\nThat's not
  quite what I had in mind.\n\n.tb\nHow about a coloured page?\n\n.to\nThat isn't
  either - I don't want a coloured page.\n\n.tb\nWhat are you, some kind of bigot?\nHere's
  a blank page.\n\n(TOLSTOY SHAKES HIS HEAD)\n\nDrawn another blank, eh? Would you
  care for an appendix?\n\n.to\nNo, I had mine out. What I want is a human-type page.\n\n.tb\nOh,
  one of those kinky types, are you?\n\n.to\nLook, I don't want any of your paper!
  I want an \nhonest-to-goodness true\n.ul\npage!\n\n.aa PAGE\n(ENTERING) Yes, sir?\n\n.aa
  TOM~AND~TOLSTOY\nWhat?\n\n.aa PAGE\nYou called for a page, sir?\n\n.to\nNow this
  is what I'm after. This has got to be him!\nMay I take him with me?\n\n.tb\nWell,
  it's highly irregular.\n\n.aa PAGE\nI beg your pardon! I know when I need a laxative.\n\n.to\nCan't
  you cut through the red tape and just let her go with me?\n\n.tb\nWell, I suppose...
  \n\n(CUTS OFF SOME RED TAPE, CUTS IT AND SIGNS IT - RUBBER STAMPS IT\nTWENTY TIMES)\n\nThere
  - that should do it!\n\n.to\nThank you wery much, sir.\n\n(TOLSTOY AND THE PAGE
  EXIT)\n\n.tb\nOh, well. Back to work, I suppose. Now where was I? Oh, yes.\n(READS)
  The Ensign departs with the page.\nSuddenly, the sound of dragging chains and menacing
  feetsteps\nis heard to approach Tom from behind-\n\n(APPROPRIATE SOUND)\n\n-and
  a giant sledgehammer is brought down upon...\n(QUICK PAUSE, THEN TOM ERASES PART
  OF THE PAGE AND SAYS THE FOLLOWING\nLINES AS HE WRITES THEM IN)\nSuddenly, I am
  set upon by 8 luscious beauties who proceed to ravish\nme and-\n\n.aa VOICE\nTom!\n\n.tb\n(QUAKING)\nYes,
