[L-1] (LIGHTS UP ON A PAIR OF TWISTING STUDENT LINE-UPS.)
FLORA POLISH: I've been at University for three years now.
and I've never seen such terrible line-ups.
JAY CLOTH: If you don't like standing in tine at Waterloo,
why don't you tine up for u of T?
FLORA: I am lined up for U of T!
WALTER WALL CARPET: (IN BRITISH ACCENT:) Lined up for U of
T? Dreadfully sorry. old thing. but in point of fact
this isn't the line for U of T. It's the line-up for Ox-
ford.
FLORA: You mean...
WALTER: Yes, my good woman. This isn't the right tine-up
at all. The show's barely under way and already you've
missed your queue.
(ADMINISTRATOR NOAH VAIL ENTERS.)
NOAH VAIL: May I have your attention. please.
(THE LINE-UPS SNAP TO ATTENTION.)
We regret to inform you that there are only enough admit- tance forms available for half of you. Being university
students, you will be quick to realize that not everyone
here will be able to register today. However, being
scholarly and academic folk, you will also realize that there is a fair and equitable method of deciding who gets the forms. That solution is, of courser a fight to the
death. (HE RAISES HIS ARM) After the count of three.
Ready, one, two. three...
[S-1] (AS THE TWO LINES ARE ABOUT TO CHARGE AT EACH OTHER.
"THE TWILIGHT ZONE" MUSIC STARTS.)
[L-2] (THE LIGHT CHANGES TO BLOOD RED. AND EVERYONE FREEZES. ROD STIRRING, DRESSED IN SUIT AND TIE, WALKS CAREFULLY BETWEEN THE RIVAL LINES.)
ROD STIRRING: (A LA ROCKY HORROR) I would Like. if I may,
to take you on a strange journey. This, ladies and gen-
tlemen, is the FASS-Night Gallery, a place where tonight, time and space will be made meaningless quantities. I am
the curator of the FASS-Night Gallery, Rod Stirring.
This evening, you will be snatched from the safety and
security of your comfortable chair, and hurtled forward
in time to an era that few would care to imagine, and,
before this, none have ever seen. The time is the fu- ture, the places an educational institution tormented for over a decade by government cutbacks, declining enroll-
ment, and fringe radical journalists. It is a turoulent world of rampant inflation and desperate measures to con- serve energy and money. The students are products of
mass programming, an attempt by a decaying educational
system to save dwindling BIU's during the cutbacks and
restraints of the nineteen eighties. Let us now then venture forth into this nebulous future and see what lies there for us. There are tales told of unpardonadly sel- fish men, of sly and unscrupulous characters, and of mon- strous things that go bump in the disco.
ES-27 (THE MUSIC SWELLS ON THAT SENTENCE. A SIGN SAYING
"DRAMATIC FORESHADOWING" COMES OUT FROM BEHIND THE PIANO.)
But then again, we may find that university life hasn't
changed that much after all. (TURNS TO LEAVE:) jh, in
case any of you suffer from time-sickness and have forgotten your Gravol tablets at home, the washrooms are on the Outer Limits of this theatre. And now. Ladies and gentlemen. FASS 1980.
CS-3J (SUDDENLY THE MUSIC STOPS.) CL-3] (NORMAL LIGHTING.)
NOAH: (DROPS HIS ARM) Go!
CS-4) (AT WHICH POINT PANDEMONIUM BREAKS LOOSE AS THE TWO
LINE-UPS ATTACK EACH OTHER, WITH ROD IN THE MIDDLE. OVER
THE P.A. ARE SOUNDS OF A HUGE BRAWL:. PUNCHES, GLASS
BREAKING, FURNITURE BREAKING, GUNSHOTS, SIRENS, ETC. THE
FIGHT DIES QUICKLY. EVERYONE IS STANDING, LOOKING AROJND,
CONFUSED THAT THE SOUND EFFECT IS STILL GOING FULL-dLAST.
THE FIGHT SOUNDS ARE ABRUPTLY ENDED.)
JAY: (TO AUDIENCE) I'm sorry, but our director started out
in radio.
ROD: What are the odds that I get out of this alive?
WALTER: I'd say. about 25 or 6-to-4.

This is the FASS show, the unsurpassed show. Maybe the last show you'll ever see.
If we're not cautious, you'll all be nauseous. At our scenes of depravity.
So please stay seated, please don't feel cheated. And you'll be treated to some great times.
We alt have terrors of making errors.
As we lose our cues and our tines.

Some jokes are new, dear, some come from last year. If you think that's weird, what you don't know. We've block the exits, there's lots of sex, it's Time for FASS, so here we go.

SHARON SHARALIKE: First it was refundable society fees,
then refundable Federation fees, and now I just can't
believe it: refundable tuition fees! Gee Lois, it's hard to get used to alt the changes that have happened in the last ten years.
LOIS BIDDER: I stiLl can't believe you were lost in the
Psychology building all that time, Sharon. It must have
been awful.
SHARON: Ohi it wasn't that bad. There were plenty of
bananas and cheese and I met this really nice bunch of white rats...
LOIS: You sure missed some unbelievable changes. Why just
Last year, they finally managed to automate the univer- sity administration.
SHARON: Oh, you mean that new computer?
LOIS: That's right, the BURT 9000. Sometimes, though. I
think att this new automation is getting out of hand. I
remember reading in the UW Record that this term they're
going to start bar-coding the frosh.
SHARON: Yes, I know.
(SHARON TURNS AROUND, REVEALING BAR-CODES ON REAR END.)
LOIS: And if you think that's strange; last year they tried
to cut costs by putting two elevators in the same snaft.

SHARON: Really?
LOIS: Uh-huh. And what about the correspondence program?
They're starting to phase out all those silly cassette
tapes. The new plan is to freeze-dry the professor and
send him. To re-activate, all you do is add hot air.
SHARON: Everything has improved so much.
LOIS: Not everything. They're experimenting with pre-
recorded meals, too. The one hitch is that no one can
stand the re-runs.
SHARON: But Lois, what about all the new programmes? Just
this morning I ran into someone in the Faculty of
Acupuncture.
LOIS: The Faculty of Acupuncture? Do we have one of those?
SHARON: Yes, the classes are over in Needles Hall.

PERRY DOG: All the book prices just went up another 110 per

END OF SONG
(THE SINGERS EXIT. WE HEAR A LOUD EXPLOSION IN THE TUNNEL,
IMMEDIATELY AFTER WHICH THE TRAP DOOR IS FLUNG OPEN. A LARGE CLOUD OF DENSE SMOKE RISES FROM THE TRAP, FOLLOWED SHORTLY BY SMEDLEY AND HAILE% SMEDLEY HAS CLEARLY HAD THE WORST OF THINGS, AND MAY BE SMOLDERING SLIGHTLY. HAILEY IS WEARING A LAB COAT AND GLASSES LIKE A LIBRARIAN.)
HAILEY PHILLIPS: Are you all right. Smedley? I'm really
sorry I dragged you into this.
SMEDLEY MERKIN: Oh, that's all right. Halley. A tittle
gamma radiation never hurt anybody.
HAILEY: Still, don't you think you should lie down or
something? I mean, after all, there are some pretty
volatile chemicals in that lab. With all the excitement,
who knows what could have happened.
SMEDLEY: No, Hailey. I'll be okay. Besides. Professor Lac-
tic will be really mad if we don't get him that report.
(DURING THIS TIME, HAILEY HAS BEEN SIPPING FROM A SMALL
BEAKER OF MILK SHE HOLDS IN HER HAND.)
HAILEY: Report?
SMEDLEY: Yes, the report on the experiment.
HAILEY: Experiment?
SMEDLEY: Yes, the one we were just working on - for Profes-
sor Lactic.
HAILEY: Professor Lactic?
SMEDLEY: Yes, Professor Lactic. Our supervisor.
HAILEY: Supervisor?
SMEDLEY: Must you repeat everything I say? You're not a
parrot, are you?
HAILEY: Parrot?
SMEDLEY: Hailey, what's wrong with you? Don't you remember
the project we've been working on for the past year? The
project to create a biochemical protein to maximize
acetylcholine synthesis in the mammalian cerebral cortex
and medulla oblongata.
HAILEY: Project?
SMEDLEY: You know, an enzyme to stimulate production of
monosubstituted biphenol delta-hydroxyaldehydes and
ketones to give tetramethytsitane.
HAILEY: Enzyme?
SMEDLEY: You know, the study serum.
HAILEY: Of course, how could I have forgotten something
like that. (PAUSE) Do I know you?
SMEDLEY: Hailey, it's me - Smedley!
HAILEY: Uh. right. Smedley. That's odd... I seem to be
suffering from mysterious memory lapses. I wonder what
could be causing them?
(SMEDLEY BEGINS SIPPING SOME MILK FROM HAILEY'S GLASS.)
It couldn't have been any of the stuff in the Lab. I
mean, you saw what happened. The only thing Left intact
was that little beaker.
SMEDLEY: What little beaker?
HALLEY: You know, that small one - like the one in your
hand. (PAUSE) Oh dear.
SMEDLEY: What do you mean. "Oh dear"?
HAILEY: Smedley, don't you realise that you're holding the
beaker that everything eventually ended up in? That must
explain all the memory lapses I've been having. We've
discovered something that can actually cause a person to
Lose his memory!
SMEDLEY: We have?
HAILEY: Of course, it'll be the greatest invention since
Punk Rocks.
SMEDLEY: Punk Rocks?
HAILEY: Yeah. They're a New Wave of Pet Rocks that can't
sing.
SMEDLEY: Hailey, what are we going to call this anti-memory
stuff?
HAILEY: Why. since I invented it. (SHE TAKES A SIP) we
could name it after me. (PAUSE) What's my name?
SMEDLEY: It's Hailey Phillips. We could call it "Hailey's
Memory Obliterator".
HAILEY: Hailey's M.O.? I don't think so. How about Phil-
lips' Milk of Amnesia? (PAUSE) I bet it keeps you
Regular.
SMEDLEY: Yes - you'll forget you're in Co-Op.
HAILEY: Well, whatever we call it, it still works like a
charm.
(SMEDLEY TAKES A SWIG FROM THE GLASS.) SMEDLEY: What does?
HAILEY: Oh, never mind. Smedley isn't it exciting? We'll
be famous!
SMEDLEY: YoLl'ii be famous - ygu discovered it. (PAUSE) Do
I know you. miss?
HAILEY: I'm Hailey, Smedley!
SMEDLEY: Pleased to meet you. Miss Smedley. I've always
wanted to know a world-famous scientist.
HAILEY: Now. Smedley, don't be modest - you had just as
much to do with it as I did. Besides...
(SHE TAKES OFF HER GLASSES AND SNUGGLES UP TO SMEDLEY.) without a big,
(SHE LETS DOWN HER HAIR.)
strong man like you I could never have set up all that
heavy equipment.
SMEDLEY: Oh, it wasn't really anything...
HALLEY: And working by my side all these months,
(SHE REMOVES HER LAB COAT.)
in the Lonely laboratory... I don't know what I would
have done without you...
SMEDLEY: Please, Miss Smedley. you're steaming my
glasses...
HAILEY: Then take them off...
(SHE REMOVES HIS GLASSES. ENTER PROFESSOR LACTIC.)
PROFESSOR LANCE LACTIC: Well, well, Haitey... I see you're
hard at work.
HAILEY: I'll say...
SMEDLEY: Why, Professor Lactic.., actually, we've been in
the lab. Miss Smedley here has discovered...
(THEY SAY THESE TWO LINES TOGETHER:) SMEDLEY: Halley's M.O.
HAILEY: Phillips' Milk of Amnesia.
(THEY SWITCH. AND SAY THE LINES TOGETHER AGAIN:)
SMEDLEY: Phillips' Milk of Amnesia.
HAILEY: Hailey's M.O.
LACTIC: I don't care what it's called.., what does it do?
(SMEDLEY TAKES A SWIG.)
SMEDLEY: What does what do?
(HAILEY TAKES THE GLASS AWAY FROM SMEDLEY AS HE FINISHES THE LAST FEW DREGS.)
HAILEY: Well, apparently anyone who drinks the stuff
suffers from amnesia.
LACTIC: Hmmm... Memory lapses, you say?
HAILEY: No. I said amnesia.
LACTIC: Oh. I forgot. Well, you'd better be careful
drinking that stuff, you might forget your whole univer--
sity education, and then you'd have to enroll and pay
your fees all over again. (REALIZATION DAWNS:) I think
you two should continue your research... immediately.
SMEDLEY: Well, we can't. You sees the lab was... well...
HAILEY: He means that there was this freak accident.
LACTIC: A freak accident? Don't tell me you graduated?
SMEDLEY: No. no. See, we were working in the lab late one
night...
LACTIC: Smedley, stop singing.
SMEDLEY: Surely.
HAILEY: Smedley and I were in the lab when suddenly a Dolt
of lightning lanced out of a clear blue sky and knocked a shelf of chemicals all over the room.
LACTIC: You know, that once happened to a colleague of
mine. He said it gave him strange and unusual super-
powers.
SMEDLEY: Realty? Like super-speed or X - ray vision?
LACTIC: Well. I never found out. He just spread his wings
and flew away without telling me.
SMEDLEY: Wow! Maybe I've got super-powers too. I could oe
just like one of those comic-book heroes!
LACTIC: With your luck, it would be Casper the Friendly
Ghost. Now, about this accident; you say the chemicals
spilled together and created this Milk of Amnesia?
(POINTS TO THE GLASS IN HAILEY'S HAND.).
SMEDLEY: No, they spilled on the radio-active spider.
LACTIC: What radio-active spider?
HAILEY: The one that was raised to manhood by a tribe of
Great African Apes when its parents were kilted by giant bees.
LACTIC: How did it get to be radio-active?
SMEDLEY: We bombarded it with gamma rays.
LACTIC: Obviously. I suppose the radio-active spider it
you?
HAILEY: No, it bit the bionic arm we were working on.
LACTIC: Do keep going. I can't wait to hear what happened
next.
SMEDLEY: Well, the bionic arm fell into our vat of super
soldier serum which splashed all over the brick of red
kryptonite on top of the green Lantern which fell into
the path of our cosmic ray generators thereby activating
the batmobite which completely destroyed our lab and
subsequently self-destructed in a burst of mystic sor-
cerous energies.
LACTIC: Uh-huh. And then what?
SMEDLEY: What do you think? I had to clean the whole mess
up.
LACTIC: Look, you replicate this amnesia experiment. I'm
going straight to the president with this!
(PROFESSOR LACTIC EXITS ABRUPTLY.)
HAILEY: Strange sort of man, isn't he? I wonder what makes
him tick?
SMEDLEY: Yes... "tick", and chime on the quarter hour...
(HAILEY AND SMEDLEY EXIT, JUST AS LOIS AND SHARON RETURN.) SHARON: Lois, didn't the bookstore used to be a tot bigger?
LOIS: Yes, but now they only keep one copy of each book.
SHARON: What do they use all the extra space for?
LOIS: Xerox machines.
(JUST THEN. BRAD TEMPLETON ENTERS AND DOES A MELODRAMATIC MOANING, GROANING, COLLAPSING SEQUENCE. HE IS FOLLOWED BY TILDE WINKS AND THE FOOD SINGERS.)
LOIS: What's the matter with him?
TILDE WINKS: Breakfast at Food Services.

FANNY C. COMETRUE: I'm practically broke. I didn't expect
all my books to cost that much! I remember when you

BOB N. FRAPPLES: Yes, how dimes have changed. Well. I'm
not worried... I'm well off. And I owe everything I have

AL HANSONDEK: Who, your father?
BOB: No, my bank manager.
KEN U. DIGGIT: And the clerks are getting really sarcastic.

if she kept stationery around the office. She said "No. I try to move around as much as possible."
AL: Sounds like my date last night. I promised to get her
home before 12, but she had 15 and passed out.
FANNY: Speaking of passing, how did you do on that English
Language Proficiency exam?
KEN: Welt, I was close to the right answers. I figure they

FANNY: I done real good. Anyway. I'm a tot better at

FANNY: As a matter of fact...
BOB: Never mind.
KEN: Sure is strange being back after spending four months
off campus. I got stationed in Ft.McMurray.
BOB: That must've been hell.
KEN: No, I was sent to Hell last term.
AL: What did you do your work report on?
KEN: Asbestos. (PAUSE) What kind of co-op job oid YOU

BOB: This past term, I was an elevator counter-weight.
AL: How was it?
BOB: The job had its ups and downs.
FANNY: I'm in co-op clothing.
AL: Yes, your sweater looks like it's on its Last work

KEN: And your pants took like they're on their last legs.
FANNY: No, I was a tailor in Kitchener-Waterloo.
BOB: Aha! A tailor of two cities!
FANNY: Not a day passed that someone didn't want into my

AL: I hear Paul Simon once had a double work term jou as a

BOB: What happened?
KEN: Cutbacks got him; the poor sod was turfed out of his

SMEDLEY: No, you haven't. But. I thought you were going
out with that football player. What was his name? Bull-

LOIS: I was, for a while. But every time I turned around,
he was kissing another woman.
SMEDLEY: What did you do?
LOIS: I stopped turning around. And I stopped seeing him.

SMEDLEY: Well, Lois, I don't know how to answer that...
LOIS: Okay, let's concentrate on gsirea then.
SMEDLEY: Well, Lois, now that you mention it. I've always
wanted to... be a super-hero. (HE RUSHES AWAY FROM
LOIS.) You know, like Superman. or Spiderman or The

clusion after careful cost-analysis, that we've reached a do-or-die situation continued-existence-wise. We have to decide today whether or not to sell out the University to some multi-national, imperialistic, oligopolistic, rich corporation.
SINCLAIR: But I thought we sold out years ago.
NOAH: Actually, we didn't sell out to the establishment so
much as get into bed with it, and now we are going to g0 all the way.
SINCLAIR: All I can say is, I hope we don't get screwed.
NOAH: Mr.President. I have taken the Liberty of placing
small ad in the papers. (READS:) Southern Ontario
University with new flagpole and fleet of tow trucks
wishes to sell out to multi-national, imperialistic,
oligopolistic, rich corporation. Phone 885-1211 during
normal business hours. Sincere inquiries only please; no
weirdos.
SINCLAIR: Isn't that a bit excessive? I think that the
BURT 9000 has made some kind of mistake.
NOAH: Now now, Mr. President, the idea of having the entire
memory of a former president of the university in a com-
puter may seem absurd to your but Look at the economics
of the situation. Instead of forking out an enormous
salary for a real president, we simply cough up a measly
few grand for a good-natured know-nothing, simpleton
figurehead like you.
SINCLAIR: I am NOT good-natured!
NOAH: The money we'll save in the first six months will
more than pay for putting all the president's knowledge
on a tiny, inexpensive chip of silicon.
SINCLAIR: Isn't it amazing what they can do with micro-
electronics these days?
NOAH: Actually, we didn't need to use micro-electronics.
(NUMNUMS ENTERS.)
MS. BIRDIE NUMNUMS: Your Honour, the deans of the faculties
are waiting outside, sir.
SINCLAIR: Very good, Ms. Numnums, send them in.

DEAN JERRY ATRIC: Actually, your secretary turned me down,

is my chief administrator, Mr. Noah Vail. Noah, please
brief the deans on this vitally important matter,
whatever it is.
NOAH: Of course. Mr. President. While you Deans have peen
Playing golf or carousing in the Faculty Club, the BJRT 9000 has been analyzing the problems of this university. In shorts gentlemen. the BURT 9000 has concluded that the university is in a real pickle.
DEAN PAT ANSWER: Pickle? You can tell by the crunch?
DEAN CONSTANCE INTERRUPTION: Sounds like a dilly of a mess!
NOAH: Quit gherkin around and listen. The BURT 9003 says
we've got real problems! None of this penny ante stuff
about declining enrolment or non-existent educational
standards, but serious stuff like where our next pay-
cheque is going to come from. What we really need is d
tong term plan to bring in the bucks so we can afford to
give ourselves the raises, bonuses, and freebie trips
which we so richty deserve.
THE DEANS: Hear, Hear!
NOAH: Gentlemen. I have taken the liberty of assigning one
of my first-year co-op acounting students to prepare
recommendations.
JERRY: You hired a co-op student?
NOAH: (APOLOGETICALLY:) We couLdn't afford to get anyone
competent. (SHOUTS OFFSTAGE:) Ms. Numnums, would you
please bring in Mr. Ernest Earnest?
BIRDIE: (ECHOING:) Right away, right away.
(NUMNUMS ESCORTS EARNEST ONSTAGE, THEN EXITS.)
NOAH: Ernest's a good lad. Very obedient and works hard.
ALL of my people work hard because they like me, isn't
that right Ernest?
ERNEST EARNEST: Yes, sir.
(NOAH SWITCHES CHARACTER INTO MILITARY MODE.)
NOAH: I can't hear you.
(ERNEST SNAPS TO ATTENTION AND STARTS SHOUTING:)
ERNEST: Yes, Sir!
NOAH: I stilt can't hear you.
ERNEST: YES, SIR!
NOAH: Louder.
ERNEST: Y E S. S I R !

ERNEST: Slime, Sir!
NOAH: What kind of slime. Ernest?
ERNEST: Lowly Co-Op slime, Sir!
NOAH: I can't hear you.
ERNEST: LOWLY CO-OP SLIME, SIR!

NOAH: All right. Ernest, that's enough. Report.
ERNEST: Yes sir. Thank you sir. (GROVEL. SNIVEL. ABASE,
ABASE:) As you can see by this chart, our situation is
rapidly getting worse.
(HE HOLDS UP A CHART WITH A STEEPLY RISING CURVE.)
DEAN EUGENE SARDIRTY: That chart looks pretty good to me.
ERNEST: Unfortunately, this is a chart showing the univer-
sity deficit and the ever-increasing student faculty
ratio. Now tbil chart, on the other hand...
(ROTATES CHART NINETY DEGREES, CURVES NOW FALL STEEPLY:)
... illustrates the trend in revenue and enrollment. As
you can see, according to the BURT 9000 fiscal projec-
tions, we are going to run out of money by next... (HIS
FINGER TRACES CURVE OFF THE CHART:) ...Monday!
EUGENE: Didn't we save a bundle in energy costs by running
the air conditioning in the winter and the heating in the summer?
ERNEST: Yes. sir. But we found we had to spend the money
fixing windows broken during the summer, and floors
ruined by people building fires during the winter.
CONSTANCE: What about the scheme to use Mafia hit men to
collect tuition?
ERNEST: We lost all we gained when we had to pay increased
Health Services costs.
PAT: Aren't we going to make a sizeable chunk of cash by
tossing the computers out of the big Red Room and con- verting it into a high-priced Disco?
ERNEST: That's truer gentlemen; but disco sucks. (PAUSE
FOR CHEERS!) Gentlemen we are faced with only one alter- native.
CONSTANCE: And what is that?
ERNEST: Abolish tenure.
THE DEANS: (TURN ON HIM AND SHOUT:) Abolish tenure?
(DEAN JERRY PULLS OUT A GUN AND SHOOTS ERNEST. wHO DIES
GROVELING. THE OTHER DEANS CONGRATULATE JERRY.)
SINCLAIR: Spunky tittle twerp, wasn't he?
NOAH: That's what's so nice about co-op students. You
don't have to recycle them.

CUSTODIAN ELMER GLOCKENSPIEL: Mr,President! Little Green
Men are hovering over the PRG Heating Plant, and they're planning to take over the whole universe...ity! I barely got away with my life!
SINCLAIR: Little Green Men? Gentlemen, the place is all
yours; I'm leaving.
NOAH: Calm down. Mr.President. You're new here. "Little
Green Men" is just the affectionate term the students use for the University custodians and heating plant staff.
They all wear green uniforms, just like Elmer here. The idea of them taking over anything is patently ridiculoJs; they couldn't even turn down the heat in my office when I asked them to.
ELMER: But, you don't understand! The Little Green Men,
they landed in a flying saucer...
NOAH: (CUTTING HIM OFF STERNLY:) Mr.Glockenspiel, we have
very important business to take care of here. (POINTS TO
EARNEST:) Why don't you make yourself useful and arrange
to have this pile of trash disposed of?
ELMER: You'll be sorry. Sir. Just you wait; the Little
Green Men are going to be Looking a lot greener before this day is through!
(ELMER EXITS.)
SINCLAIR: Now then. gentlemen. Do you have any further
ideas on how we are going to save our paycheques?
EUGENE: Sinclair, can't we just take it out on the stu-
dents?
CONSTANCE: Sure, we can add an extra year to the optometry
program!
JERRY: Mr.President, Dean Pat Answer and I thought it might
be best to tackle this problem in the modern idiom.
SINCLAIR: Who are you calling an idiom?
PAT: The modern idiom, Mr.President, is television. We
could raise money by sponsoring a catchy University Game
Show. Dean Jerry Atric wilt demonstrate.
JERRY: (HAMMING IT:) Good afternoon. Ladies and Gentlemen,
and welcome to Canada's favourite afternoon pastime:
Bowling for Doctorates.
PAT: (ALSO HAMMING IT:) If you can't bowl, then timber up
your fingers with: Dialing for Diplomas.
JERRY: Followed by Graduate for a Day. the All-New Grading
Game, and the Sixty-Four-Thousand-Dollar Tuition!
PAT: And to top it all off, for you University of Guelph
frosh, there's the agricultural game show: Reach for the
Crop!
EUGENE: Yes, I'm sure there are plenty of other ways we can
find to exploit the students.

(NUMNUMS RE-ENTERS.)
BIRDIE: Your gloriousnesss there is a person outside who
would speak with you. A Dr. Lance Lactic.
SINCLAIR: A Doctor whom?
BIRDIE: No sir. Dr. Whom was Last year's mad scientist.
Prof Lactic is our mad scientist this year.
SINCLAIR: Well., I guess it's safe enough to see him.
(LACTIC BURSTS IN.)
PROFESSOR LANCE LACTIC: All right, you clods; I've sent 27
memos to this office and they've all been to no avail.
(ALL LOOK TO NOAH VAIL.)
NOAH: Don't look at me. Everything I get is to Noah Vail.
LACTIC: I'm mad as het! and I'm not going to take it any
more!
SINCLAIR: Right. Ms. Numnums, would you be so kind as to
bring some downers for Professor Lactic here?
BIRDIE: Right away, mon seigneur...
LACTIC: Stay where you are. Numnums. Look, Sinclair. I
know att. your sleazy tricks and I'm not going to stand
for them any more. I'm so mad, I could just spit.
(HE TRIES TO SPIT SEVERAL TIMES, BUT FAILS.)
BIRDIE: Dr.Lactic. I didn't think that the "mad" in mad
scientist meant angry. I thought it meant crazy.
LACTIC: Crazy? CRAZY? CRAZY ?! Well, a bit.
(EAGERLY:) Listen to me! I came in here to reveal to you
a secret that wilt save the university.
NOAH: What's that?
LACTIC: I can make the students ignorant.
BIRDIE: Someone beat you to it. Lance.
LACTIC: That may be, but the students thiok that they are
smart! My new secret chemical formula will change all
that.
SINCLAIR: What is it?
LACTIC: I call it... Milk of Amnesia. Just one tiny parsec
of this stuff will make a student forget everything he
has ever learned. Picture it: a typical student, going
to classes all term, doing alt the assignments writing
the midterms...
PAT: That's a typical student?
LACTIC: Then one day, the week before exams the student
has a glass of milk at the cafeteria. This is no
ordinary milk; this is my secret Milk of Amnesia. In ex-
actly two minutes, all that expensive knowledge is gone,
wiped out. poof! No hope of recovery in time for exams.
What is to be done? The university comes to the rescue. In view of the seriousness of the affliction, the student is permitted to retake, and pay for, the courses next term.
CONSTANCE: Why, that's astounding!
SINCLAIR: I get the idea. We make the same student pay for
his education over and over again!
NOAH: Quite right. Mr.President. Of courses we shouldn't
keep a student around too long, otherwise someone might
smell a rat.
EUGENE: People are suspicious enough of grad students as it
is.
CONSTANCE: So after eight or nine years we graduate the
student; mustn't be too greedy. eh?
LACTIC: But before I can save the university. I need a
typical human subject to determine the exact dosage of
Milk.
1:3 A Motive for Amnesia Pa g e 10
NOAH: (TO THE DEANS:) We wouldn't want students to forget
how to sign cheques, now would we?
SINCLAIR: Where are we going to find a student dump enough
to act as a guinea pig?
EUGENE: How about at our new student Disco?
CONSTANCE: Sure. The place will be so dark and noisy that
no one will notice if we bop a student on the head and
drag him out the back way.
PAT: Most of them Look like they've just been bopped on the
head anyway.
EUGENE: And dragged out the back way.
JERRY: We could keep the student guinea pig over in the PRG
heating plant with the Little Green Men while Lactic
finds out the dosage. That way, no one will trace the
student to us.
SINCLAIR: Great idea. Lance. I hope you can get it
developed before you leave.
LACTIC: Leave? Where am I going?
SINCLAIR: Well, we need some money for the Deans' raises
next week, and since you're the last non-tenured faculty
member. As of tomorrow, you're fired.
(LACTIC REACTS WITH SHOCKED DISBELIEF.)
All right, gentleman let's disco!

MAY: (READING:) Special emphasis will be placed on faei
analysis and transfer...
DENNIE: (READING:) As well as in-depth observation of ther-
mal degradation of organic matter.
WILLIE: We aren't doing any of that stuff.
CHARLIE: Why, that describes your job perfectly. (POINTS

JESSIE: Coal.
CHARLIE: (AS IF THIS EXPLAINED IT:) Fuel analysis. And what
do you use those shovels for?
MAY: Putting the coal into the furnace.
CHARLIE: Fuel transfer. And what happens to the coal in the
furnace?
DENNIE: It burns.
CHARLIE: A hearth-warming example of in-depth observation
of thermal degradation of organic matter.
WILLIE: That's ridiculous! I quit!
CHARLIE: You can't quit, you're fired! (GRABS CO-OP AND

Although we have been extensivety trained to look, talk,
and act like humans...
(ABSURDITIES IS WATCHING SOPHOCLES INTENTLY, HIS MOUTH
HANGING OPEN AND A DUMB EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE.)
... at least, some of us act like humans, we must never
forget that we are atien invaders from the glorious
planet - Bonzo Cat!
(THE OTHERS ALL MAKE MEOWING SOUNDS.)
Thank you. Now I'm certain that I don't have to tell you
that, as alien invaders from the glorious planet Bonzo
Cat...
(MEOWING SOUNDS AGAIN.)
- thank you - it is our mission to take over the
universe. And. I'm sure there is no need to tell you, as
alien invaders from the glorious planet Bonzo Cat...
(MEOWS.)
- thank you - whose mission it is to take over the
universe, we have been sent to the nefarious planet
Mother Earth...
(ABSURDITIES MEOWS. THE OTHERS GLARE AT HIM.) ABSURDITIES: Sorry.
SOPHOCLES: Yes. We have been sent to the planet Earth to
steal the formula for the most significant and exciting
product to grace this galaxy since the invention of the
electric cat opener.
ARISTOPHANES: The electric CAT opener?
SOPHOCLES: It may not sound practical to you, but you have
to think of the people who own electric cats.
EURIPIDES: What is this new product we're supposed to
steal?
SOPHOCLES: Milk of Amnesia.
EURIPIDES: What does it do?
SOPHOCLES: It will solve the foremost social problem of our
glorious planet.
ALL: You mean...
SOPHOCLES: Yes! Clogged drains! Milk of Amnesia cleans
out everything from minds to septic tanks.
ABSURDITIES: Wow - Cosmic Liquid Plumber!
SOPHOCLES: Exactly. As a first step in locating the for-
mula for Milk of Amnesia, our plan is to convert the
custodians and heating plant staff here at PRG into
aliens like ourselves, invaders from the glorious planet
Bonzo Cat!
(MEOWS.)
Now Let me make sure we all understand the role each of us will play in the sanctimoniously sacred secret sym-
bolic ceremony of... alienation. Aristophanes, you will
be in charge of applying the special feline aromatic
yetzinolotz to the Earthling's thinking appendage.
ARISTOPHANES: (HOLDING UP THE FISH:) I've got the fish
right here. Sophocies.
SOPHOCLES: Euripides!
EURIPIDES: Yes glorious leader?
SOPHOCLES: It's your responsibility to place the alien
brain conversion antennae on the Earthling nerve centers.
EURIPIDES: (HOLDING UP THE ARROWS) Right!
SOPHOCLES: Absurdities!
ABSURDITIES: (REPEATING:) Wow - Cosmic Liquid Plumber!
SOPHOCLES: Absurdities! Pay attention! I'm depenoing on
you to distract the Earthlings while we do the important
stuff.

ABSURDITIES: (HOLDING UP TRIANGLE.) I can do that. boss.
ARISTOPHANES: But Sophocles, how will we know if we have
succeeded in the conversion?
SOPHOCLES: We may count on the change having a bizarre,
transitory effect on the Earthlings.
ABSURDITIES: What?
SOPHOCLES: It's a secret.
ABSURDITIES: I bet you don't even know.
SOPHOCLES: BET? Did you say BET?
(PERSON BEHIND PIANO HOLDS UP SIGN "CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT".)
Don't you know that the inhabitants of our planet are in- veterate gamblers?
ABSURDITIES: Invertebrate gamblers? You mean we bet on
slugs?
SOPHOCLES: We bet on anything.
ABSURDITIES: I bet we don't.
ARISTOPHANES AND EURIPIDES: How much?
SOPHOCLES: Stop it! We must rise above our gambling
instincts - we're here to wager war... uhh, wage a war. We've done enough pussy-footing around; our first convert awaits. (POINTS TO DAVE:) Stalk the prey stealthily...
(ALIENS SURROUND DAVE, WHO DOESN'T NOTICE THEM.) And... Pounce!

ARISTOPHANES: (HOLDS UP FISH TO EAR) No, it sounds all
right to me. Perfectly in tuna.
SOPHOCLES: Waite he's going to say something!
(DAVE LOOKS AROUND, THEN AT SOPHOCLES, AND SPEAKS WITH SOFT SHOE SONG AND DANCE ROUTINE TO THE DR.PEPPER SONG.)

crystals, this entire complex will be a much more ef-

DAVE: I'll bet you'll never guess. Charlie.
CHARLIE: Looks like an alien brain conversion antenna to
me.
DAVE: Best two out of three?
CHARLIE: Never mind. Who are these friends of yours? Do
they play a lot of cards?
DAVE: Just the usual fifty-two. As a matter of fact. Char-

DAVE: what'll it be? Poker? Baccarat? Fisbin? Roulette?
CHARLIE: Roulette? Dave, I thought we were going to play
cards?
DAVE: How much do you want to bet we can't play roulette?
Let's seer with 52 cards, half red, half black...
SOPHOCLES: Pounce!
EL-33 (THE ALIENS DO THEIR NUMBER ON THE THREE CO-OPS. THE
LIGHTS AGAIN FLASH. THE CO-OPS DO THE SOFT SHOE SUNG AND
DANCE ROUTINE TO THE DR.PEPPER SONG:)
ALL CO-OPS: I'm an alien, you're an alien, he's an alien,
she's an alien, everyone's an alien now.
CHARLIE: Will you guys just settle down and play cards?
DAVE: All right! My deal. Dealer's choice. Any card draw,
anything wild, anything goes, winner take all!
(DAVE BEGINS DEALING MADLY.)
CHARLIE: What's gotten into you guys? You hardly used to
bet at all and now...
(THE ALIENS ATTEMPT TO CONVERT CHARLIE, HITTING HIM IN THE FACE WITH THE FISH.)
(GAGS) What the - yecch, what are you doing? That tastes
like a rancid tuna!
ALL ALIENS: Sorry Charlie! We don't use tunas that taste
good.
(DAVE AND THE OTHER CO-OP-ERS CHORTLE AGREEABLY.) SOPHOCLES: Try it again. cats!
(THEY HIT CHARLIE WITH THE PROPER RITUAL, EXCEPT THAT HE IS
HIT ON THE BOTTOM WITH THE FISH. CHARLIE STANDS.)
CHARLIE: (SINGING:) It's the real thing...
ABSURDITIES: How come it worked that time?
EURIPIDES: The hind is willing, but the fish is weak!
ARISTOPHANES: I had a haunch you'd say that.
SOPHOCLES: Quickly there is no time to lose. Remove the
brain conversion antennae. The arrows are rented and we
pay by the hour.
(THE ALIENS REMOVE THE ANTENNAE FROM ALL NEW CONVERTS.) Welcome, fellow aliens from the planet Bonzo Cat! (ALL NEW ALIENS MAKE MEOWING SOUNDS.)
Soon the last vestiges of the PRG will be converted.
Through them, we'll control this campus, and nothing wilt stop our glorious cause!
(THE GROUP CAWS LIKE CROWS; SOPHOCLES STARES THEM DOWN.) ALL ALIENS: Sorry.
SOPHOCLES: With our foolproof conversion methods we will
soon alienate the entire campus.
CHARLIE: Just like the Chevron.
SOPHOCLES: Now it's time you new recruits understood our
battle plans. Euripides, get the map.
EURIPIDES: Right boss.
(SHE RUNS OFF FOR THE MAP.)
SOPHOCLES: And while she's gone. I think our second-in-
command. Aristophanes, should give you new people an
outline of all the rights and privileges of your new
alien status.
ARISTOPHANES: (A LA DON PARDO) Thank you Sophocles. First
of all, our lucky conquests have won their own personal keys to the alien executive washroom. Long, thin, and
fashioned in durable base metal, these keys will provide
hours of relief and reading pleasure especially for you.
(SCATTERED APPLAUSE.)
And next you'll receive your very own PRG little green
man uniform.
DENNIE: What does PRG stand for?
SOPHOCLES: Psuedo-Physical Resources Group.
ARISTOPHANES: Yes, all the best dressed aliens on campus
are wearing these fashionable outfits, courtesy of
Spiegel Catalogues. Chicago Illinois, 60609. A perfect
disguise that allows you to fit in anywhere, they also avert suspicion if anyone sees you coming to headquarters here in the bowels of the Physical Services Building.
JESSIE: But what about the real PRG people?
SOPHOCLES: There may be one or two of the beggars hiding on
campus, but we'll smoke them out eventually.
DAVE: Is that what's causing all those fire alarms?
ARISTOPHANES: And lastly, you new converts have won.., an
all-expenses-paid trip to our flying saucers currently
hovering over the university smokestack.
(WILD APPLAUSE.)
Yes, this is a vacation of a lifetime for you ano your
spouses and kittens. You'll be transported up there via
our luxurious matter transport system, courtesy of Alien
Express Traveller's Cheques. Don't leave Alpha Centauri
without them.
CHARLIE: What's this about a matter transport system?
SOPHOCLES: Quite simple. really. We've installed a gigantic
spring loaded platform inside the smokestack itself. You
just hop on and the spring bounces you right up into the
saucer.
ABSURDITIES: I don't like that thing. It makes me jumpy.
SOPHOCLES: It's perfectly safe.
ABSURDITIES: What happens if they don't open the entry
hatch in the saucer. eh? Boing. splat!
SOPHOCLES: Don't be so negative. Absurdities, that hasn't
happened for days.
(EURIPIDES ENTERS WITH THE MAP.)
Ahh good. Euripides. Just roll the map out right here. (SHE PROCEEDS TO DO SO.)
Now, let me outline our battle strategy. We have five
hundred tanks over in Free Parking, and another three
hundred at the corner of Baltic Avenue and Go. They'll move in towards the centre and meet with the Lead pipe in the Conservatory, take the secret passage to the Lounge, and from there move our Queen to Queen's levet Three.
Meanwhile, our armies of Dwarfs and Frogs will converge
on Irkutsk from Alaska. Australia, and Aldebaran. taking the territory with little personal Risk, and picking up a red triple word score on the way. Any questions?
DENNIE: What do we do while all that's going on?
SOPHOCLES: Our whole plan revolves around obtaining the
Milk of Amnesia before the rest of this goes into action.
ABSURDITIES: What do we need the Milk of Amnesia for if
we've got eight hundred tanks and two armies of Dwarfs
and Frogs?
SOPHOCLES: If we don't have the Milk of Amnesia, we can't
unclog the drains. If we can't unclog the drains, we
can't use the showers. And if we can't use the showers,
eight hundred tanks full of dwarves and frogs who haven't
bathed in three months are not going to take this planet
by surprise. At any rate, our job is to find the Milk of
Amnesia and test it to make sure it works. That means we have to spread out around the campus.
(HE GETS A FEW PROPS OUT OF HIS POCKET.)
Now Aristophanes, you're this bottle cap, and we'll put
you here by the bookstore. Euripides is the bubble gum and you'll go in the duck pond.
EURIPIDES: I want to be the bottle cap.
SOPHOCLES: Pardon?
EURIPIDES: Aristophanes always gets to be the bottle cap.
I want to be it this time.
SOPHOCLES: All right, you're the bottle cap.
ARISTOPHANES: I'm not gonna be the bubble gum.
SOPHOCLES: Okay, you can be the penny.
ARISTOPHANES: What year?
SOPHOCLES: It doesn't matter! Absurdities, you're the
bubble gum and you go...
ABSURDITIES: I'm not gonna be the bubble gum.
SOPHOCLES: Oh for heaven's sake, you people, we have to
find that Milk of Amnesia. We can't waste time with this
sort of nonsense.
ABSURDITIES: I'm not gonna be the bubble gum.
CHARLIE: If the whole idea is to find this Milk of Amnesia
stuff, why don't you just go down to the disco?
EURIPIDES: Somehow the logic of that escapes me.
DAVE: If it's a drug you're after, the disco is always the
place to go. It's just opening tonight; the place will
be packed.
SOPHOCLES: All right Earthlings take us to your disco.
We'll kitty-nap a few humans and see if they know where
the formula is. Roll up the map. Euripides. I'll have Morris get it back up to the ship so the Earthlings don't find it and discover our secret plans.
(HE GOES TO THE BOUNCE TUBE AND GRABS A PAPER CUP DANGLING ON THE END OF A STRING NEARBY.)
Hello. Morris, can you drop down for a second?
MORRIS: (VOICE OVER:) Right.
CS-2] (SOUND OF A CAT FALLING 20 METERS ONTO A SPRING,
KATHIE). MORRIS STUMBLES OUT OF TUBE.)
SOPHOCLES: You're supposed to land on your feet. Morris.
MORRIS: That may be one small step for a man, but it's a
hell of a tong drop for a cat. Thank God I've... (PAUSE
AS HE REALIZES:) hgj nine lives.
(HE RIPS OFF A SHEET STAPLED TO HIS CHEST: NINE LIES NOW
READS EIGHT LIVES.)
SOPHOCLES: Take this map back up to the ship. Morris.
MORRIS: Yes sir.
(HE PICKS UP THE MAP AND GOES TO THE BOUNCE TUBE.)
ARISTOPHANES: (CLOSING THE DOORS OF THE BOUNCE TUBE:) Ready
to go? Transporting now.
C5-3) (HE PUSHES THE BOUNCE TUBE BUTTON: BOING. BRIEF
SILENCE. SPLAT. MORRIS' COSTUME FALLS FROM THE ROOF.)
SOPHOCLES: (SHAKING HEAD:) They've got to get those hatch
doors open faster.

WILCO. IS A TYPICAL GO-GETTER. HIS VICE-PRESIDENT, MONA NUCLEOSIS, IS ASLEEP BESIDE HIM AND NEVER REALLY WAKES UP, MUCH LIKE THE DORMOUSE IN ALICE IN WONDERLAND. ALSO PRESENT ARE EDDIE MATCH OF ENGINEERING AND POLLY SYLLABIC OF PSYCHOLOGY IN VARIOUS POSTURES OF DISINTEREST.)
ROGER WILCO: Another meeting of the AIA. right Mona? The
Association of Intrepid Astronauts. Doesn't it make your heart surge with pride to be flowing with the wave of the future, even if you're only a tiny drip? Mona? Mona?
(HE NUDGES HER.)
MONA NUCLEOSIS: Not again tonight. Brian; enough's enough.
ROGER: My name's not Brian. it's Roger Wilco.
MONA: Jolly for you Roger.
ROGER: Wake up. Mona, we have to start the meeting.
(SHE MANAGES TO STIR HERSELF INTO SOME SEMBLANCE OF AR)USAL, THOUGH IT IS CLEAR SHE COULD GO BACK TO SLEEP ANY SECOND. ROGER CLEARS HIS THROAT AND CONTINUES OBLIVIOUSLY.)
Ahem. Well. I'd like to welcome all you amateur
astronauts here today and I guess it's time we called
this meeting to order. (HE TAPS HIS GAVEL.)
EDDIE MATCH: I move we adjourn.
POLLY SYLLABIC: Second it.

adjourn now.
POLLY: Second it.
MONA: All in favour?
ROGER: Stop that! What do you think we intrepid astronauts
would Look like if everyone took that kind of self-
centred, unproductive, and negative attitude?
EDDIE: The Federation?
POLLY: I move we disband.
EDDIE: Second it.
MONA: ALL in favour?
ROGER: You're out of order, so just stop this silliness.
It's written right in our constitution that there will be absolutely no motions from the floor until after the singing of our club song.
POLLY: I move we change the constitution.
EDDIE: Second it.
MONA: Al( in favour?
ROGER: Really! (POINTING TO EDDIE AND POLLY) You say
you'll change the constitution. Well, you know. (POINTING TO HIMSELF AND MONA) we all want to change the world. Now enough fooling around; everyone rise for the club song.
(HE STANDS AND TAKES OFF HIS CAP. WITH SOME PROMPTING MONA
ALSO SLUMPS TO HER FEET. EVENTUALLY EDDIE STANDS. BUT POLLY
DOESN'T. ROGER PULLS OUT A PITCH-PIPE, BLOWS A NOTE. HUMS A

END OF SONG
POLLY: Have you ever understood what that song means?
EDDIE: Beats me.
ROGER: Now that our meeting is officially opened. I think
we can proceed with...
(THE THREE REMAINING AIA MEMBERS ENTER: CHESTER FIELD OF
MATH, CV NUSITIS OF OPTOMETRY, AND LUCY DIAMONDSKI OF I.S.)
CV NUSITIS: So he says, "If I'd known you were French. I
would have worn galoshes."
ROGER: Do you three know you're late?
LUCY DIAMONDSKI: No, but if you hum a few bars...
ROGER: You've all missed the singing of the club song.
LUCY: Oh wows what a bummer. man.
CHESTER FIELD: Actually we were waiting out in the hall
till we knew it was over.
EDDIE: Blast. I wish 1'j thought of that.
ROGER: Well hurry and get sitting down. We've got impor-
tant business to discuss.
(THEY MOVE TO THEIR PLACES AS CV BEGINS TO COMPLAIN.)
CV: You're Lucky I'm here at all. I've got a headache and
a stuffed-up nose and a sore throat and a fever...
POLLY: Cy, you're a bad influenza.
ROGER: 3e quiet, all of you; I have important news! The
intrepid astronauts are going to Puild a spaceship.
MONA: They are?
ROGER: We are.
MONA: Who are?
ROGER: You are.
EDDIE: (SINGING) We are, we are, we are, we are...
POLLY: Stop singing, Eddie.
EDDIE: Surely.
LUCY: Far freaking out. Will we be like blasting off into
the cosmic unknown, to explore groovy new worlds, to seek out new highs and new vegetation, to blindly go where no Lizard has gone before?
ROGER: Actually we're aiming for the top of the heating
plant smokestack.
LUCY: Close enough.
POLLY: What in heaven's name do we want to go to the top of
the smokestack for?
ROGER: There's a UFO there and someone has to do something
about it.
LUCY: UFO? The University's Freaking Out?
EDDIE: Nahh, it's something they eat in the Village:
Unidentified Frying Objects.
ROGER: Unidentified Flying Object.., and it's run by aliens
who have taken over the PRG!
CV: Hey, how do ygu know about the PRG? That's a secret.
ROGER: I read it in the Imprint.
CY: Then it's siiii a secret.
ROGER: Now, since we're the only astronautical organization
on campus, it's obviously up to us to build a spaceship
that will fly up to the UFO...
CHESTER: Unidentified Frisbee-like Object?
ROGER: Hush, As I was saying, it's up to us and we're
going to do it. Our vice-president, Mona Nucleosis, has
been at work for days drawing up a plan to get the
spaceship built in the shortest time possible, and with
any luck we'll be able to mount our assault on the aliens... (HE LOOKS AT HIS WATCH)... shortly after inter- mission. Go ahead Mona, the floor's all yours.
MONA: Thanks.
(SHE ROLLS OFF HER CHAIR ONTO THE FLOOR.)
ROGER: Mona, wake up! You have to telt us what you've ar-
ranged for the spaceship.
MONA: (GETTING UP) What spaceship? Oh yeah, I was supposed
to took after that, wasn't I.
ROGER: You mean you haven't? Mona, you're our vice-
president. You're supposed to be on top of this
spaceship thing.
LUCY: She's supposed to be on top of the spaceship? dow,
just like a maidenhead.
CV: I think you mean figurehead.
MONA: Uhh, don't worry. umm. Roger, I've got it alt figured
out. Sort of.
(SHE BEGINS TO SORT THROUGH THE PAPERS IN FRONT OF HER.)
ROGER: So you know things like who's going to make the
rocket fuel?
MONA: Rocket fuel... no. I guess that's the one thing I
hadn't thought about. Who wants to make the rocket fuel?
POLLY: Surely the most obvious choice is our representative
from the Science faculty, Cy Nusitis.
CV: What do I know about rocket fuel? EDDIE: You're in science, aren't you?
CV: Optometry. If I tried to mix up some rocket fuel. I'd
only make a spectacle of myself.
(THE OTHERS GIVE HIM A GLASSY STARE.)
ROGER: Forget the fuel... Who do you have looking after
the navigation system, Mona?
MONA: Uhh. navigation. Right. We'll have to be aole to
navigate won't we? Forgot about that. Well, does anyone
here know how to navigate?
CV: How about our representative from the math faculty.
Chester Field?
CHESTER: What do I know about navigation? I can still get
lost finding my way around campus. Sometimes I even get
lost in thought.
CV: Yeah, but mathies are always doing navigation ques-
tions. You know the sort of thing. A five hundred pound
man is sailing away from a lighthouse due north oy northwest at a speed of three parsecs, so how fast is his shadow rotating when the trains collide?
CHESTER: You would have to ask that one. I never could get
it.
ROGER: And we're not getting anywhere. Mona, you didn't
think about navigation or fuel; did you think aoout ac-
tually constructing the rocket?
MONA: Hmm? Oh, construction, yes. construction. I thought
about that a tot. I wrote everything about construction
down on a oiece of pager.
ROGER: Good.
MONA: But I left it at home. Anyone know anything about
construction?
CHESTER: You'd think our representative engineer. Eddie
Match, would know something about that.
EDDIE: Not a chance. We engineers don't build things we
wreck 'em. Destructive testings you know.
LUCY: I get wrecked now and then too.
POLLY: What kind of tests do you make?
EDDIE: Ohi how many sticks of dynamite it takes to blast a
chunk of red fibreglass to ribbons, stuff like that.
ROGER: Mona, if you haven't even decided who's going to put
the rocket together, what have you done?
MONA: Umm. I thought about re-entry.
ROGER: What about re-entry?
MONA: We've got to make a soft landing. right? I figure
we'll line the bottom of the ship with rubber so we won't land nearly as hard.
CY: But then we'll bounce around and make ourselves sick!
EDDIE: Mona, do you realize how much rubber it'll take to
cover the entire bottom of a spaceship?
MONA: A lot less than to cover the campus, which was my
first thought. Anyway. I've worked out a deal with a
Local perambulator company to get exactly what we need.
CV: What could you possibly get from a perambulator company
that we could put on our spaceship?
MONA: Big black rubber baby buggy bumpers. ALL: What?
MONA: We're going to cover the bottom of our ship with big
black rubber baby buggy bumpers.
ROGER: Who ever heard of a spaceship with a big black
rubber baby buggy bumper bottom?
MONA: Better a big black rubber baby buggy bumper bottom
than bouncing about between buildings barricaded by big
black rubber baby buggy bumpers.
LUCY: I think I'm having a big black rubber baby buy
bumper bummer.
CS-13 (SUDDEN FANFARE OF TRUMPETS. SMEDLEY MERKIN CJIES
DASHING ON STAGE, SHOUTING:)
SMEDLEY MERKIN: Here I come to save the day!!
(HE FALLS OVER THE TABLE.)
LUCY: Far freaking out. It's Luke Skywalker.
CY: Wrong movie. Lucy.
LUCY: Sorry. man.
SMEDLEY: (GETTING UP) I can't understand it. It looks so
simple on film.
EDDIE: Speaking of things that look simpler who are you?
SMEDLEY: I'm the new superhero on campus.
EDDIE: What's your name?
SMEDLEY: Uhh. I can't tell you that. Haven't you heard of
a secret identity?
CHESTER: Yes, but usually superheroes only keep their
.Eiyilidp identities a secret; they let people know tneir
professional names.
SMEDLEY: Well you won't catch me in silly half measures
like that. Suffice it to say that I'm the superhero who
dares to be known by actions alone.
POLLY: What kind of actions?
SMEDLEY: To tell the truth. I haven't done a great deal of
anything yet.
POLLY: Except make an idiot of yourself.
SMEDLEY: But any day now. I'm going to make a name for
myself.., so to speak.
EDDIE: I can think of a couple good names for you right
now.
ROGER: Mr.Hero. I really must protest.
SMEDLEY: My friends call me Supey.
LUCY: Wow. When they finally start a comic book about you,
man, a name like Supey can really help sales.
ROGER: As I was saying. Supey, we can't be disturbed right
now. We're discussing a matter of cosmic importance.
CHESTER: Say. maybe Supey can help us with this. Super-
heroes always know a lot about spaceships and aliens.
SMEDLEY: Well. I'm a little different from the superheroes
you might know...
POLLY: Right, all the superheroes I know wear brown.
SMEDLEY: I'm really quite new at this game. I haven't
found out what my powers are yet. I put on the cape and
leotards and run around hoping something will come to me.
POLLY: Like fruit flies?
CY: Then how do you know you Acc a superhero? SMEDLEY: That's kind of a long story...
POLLY: I've heard it and if you'll pardon me for pointing
this out, it seems to me that while a good many things
happened around you, absolutely nothing happened tg you.
SMEDLEY: Oh sure, be negative if you want. Go ahead, dash
all my hopes.
CHESTER: Look, she didn't mean...
SMEDLEY: With the radioactive spider, the gamma rays, and
the bolt of lightning. I'll be the only person in history who was in the middle of all that mumbo-jumbo and didn't become super.
CY: There. there...
SMEDLEY: Ever since I was a little boy. I've secretly hoped
that my parents found me inside a rocketship instead of
under the cabbage leaf they told me about.
EDDIE: Don't get excited now...
SMEDLEY: I've tried to find out what kind of superhero I
am. I took a crack at leaping the Arts Library in a
single bound, and only ended up in the moat. I tried
running superfast around the ringroad, but I was out-
jogged by a sixty year old Swede. I tried lifting a car
but that didn't work...
EDDIE: I Lifted a '53 Buick once; but then, the owner had
left the keys in the ignition.
SMEDLEY: I tried on a Scottish Batman outfit, you know -
the one with the bagpipes and Utility Sporran? I stepped
outside and the frost damn near froze my knees together.
I was fighting with that silly skirt they make you wear.
when I almost got run over by a snowplow. I yelled out
to the guy - "Watch out! You almost got me killed!"; and
he yells back - "So dry clean it!".
CHESTER: Maybe we can suggest other superpowers you haven't
thought of yet.
LUCY: Like maybe you're the kind of superhero who can be
totally encased in cement and baked into a cheese Janish without being hurt.
SMEDLEY: What if I tried it and found out I wasn't?
LUCY: Que sera sera. man.
CY: Maybe you're so supersmart you can telt. the exact con-
tents of Mystery Meat.
ROGER: Maybe you can be torn apart by wild gerbils and put
yourself back together again.
EDDIE: Maybe you can telepathically control park benches
(nurses).
MONA: Maybe you can turn rabbits into 24-carrot gold.
POLLY: Maybe you can dive off the top of the CN Tower and
land in a wet Kleenex.
CHESTER: Maybe you can mainline 3-in-1 oil and turn into a
robot.
SMEDLEY: You people are desperately sick. you know that?
(CY SNEEZES INTO SMEDLEY'S CAPE AND NODS.)
Besides. I don't need your help. Someday I will find my
special powers. if I just keep at it.

SMEDLEY: And now, my friends. I think I'll go off to see if
I have Super Vision.
(HE EXITS.)
POLLY: If he had any supervision, he wouldn't be running
around in that stupid outfit.
ROGER: Well, now that that interruption is over,! think we
can...
(ROGER IS INTERRUPTED BY THE ENTRANCE OF LOIS BIDDER.) LOIS BIDDER: Smedley! Smedley, are you here?
ROGER: Not again! Who are you?
LOIS: I'm Lois Bidder and I'm looking for Smedley Merkin.
Have you people seen him?
POLLY: I don't suppose he was that turkey in tights who
just traipsed out of here?
LOIS: Oh dear, is he up to that again?
EDDIE: He does this sort of thing often?
LOIS: Ever since that freak accident in his lab.
CY: We heard about that.
LOIS: Yes, since his partner HaiLey invented Milk of Am-
nesia, Smedley's convinced something must have happened
to him too. He's making a super idiot of himself. and I
have to stop him.

END OF SONG
(SHE HURRIES OUT.)
ROGER: Is she gone? Lock the doors just to make sure.
(EDDIE AND CHESTER LOCK THE WING DOORS.)
Good. Now as I was saying...
(ENTER THE MUSICAL INTERRUPTION FROM THE VOM, PLAYING LOUDLY. ROGER COLLAPSES SOBBING ON THE DESK. WHEN THE AND IS FULLY ON STAGE THE LEADER SHUSHES THEM.)
MUSIC ENSEMBLE LEADER: Any of you guys around here know where the disco is?
EDDIE: Disco?
LEADER: Yeah, we're supposed to be playing at the campus
disco any minute now.
CY: I didn't know we had a campus disco.
LEADER: We didn't until today. They've turned the computer
red room in the math building into a disco now.
CHESTER: They have?
LEADER: Well they had to do something with all that space
after they phased out the computer science program.
CHESTER: Why did they phase out the computer science
program?
LEADER: I don't know; I guess the students just couldn't
hack it. (PAUSE FOR GROANS) Oh well, this obviously
isn't the disco. Come on, we'll keep Looking.
(THE BAND MARCHES OUT, PLAYING LOUDLY.)
ROGER: (LIFTING HIS HEAD) Are they gone?
POLLY: They looked pretty gone to me.
ROGER: ALL right, before there are any more interruptions,
we'll get the business of the spaceship construction over with. All in favour?
(NO ONE MOVES.)
Opposed?
(THEY ALL RAISE THEIR HANDS.)
Carried. Now. since Mona's plans were a bit of a bust,
I've thought up a new approach. We're going to draw
lots.
(GROANS FROM THE OTHERS.)
Come on, we're all equally ignorant of everything that's
required to build a spaceship, so it won't matter who
does what.
CY: Can I quit the club?
CHESTER: Second it.
MONA: All in favour?
ROGER: No. Now this envelope contains the names of
everyone here. I'll think of something that needs building for the spaceship and then pull out the name of the person who'll do it. Agreed?
ALL: No.
ROGER: Tough. The first thing is to design the actual body
of the spaceship. Mona, the envelope please. And the person in charge is... our representative from Integrated Studies, Lucy Diamondski.
LUCY: Far freaking out.
POLLY: Just what we need, a spaceship shaped like a hash
pipe.
ROGER: Our second area is power and propulsion, and that
goes to... our engineer. Eddie Match.
EDDIE: Oh goodie. Well. maybe I can get a bunch of co-op
engineers to run around on hamster wheels.
CY: Why not just use hamsters? They're more dependable.
EDDIE: Yeah, but you don't have to pay engineers as much.
ROGER: Next we have to take care of communication; and the
winner is... our Arts Representative, Polly Syllabic.
CHESTER: But she's in Psych.
POLL?: So what?
CHESTER: You can't put a person from osychology in charge
of communication. Once they start into that psy-
chological gobbledygook, no one will understand a word.
POLLY: Just the sort of puerile protestation one might ex-
pect from an anal-retentive moron with delusions of gran- deur.
ROGER: And next we need someone to look after navigation.
And it's going to be... Mona Nucleosis of Environmental
Studies.
EDDIE: Mona as navigator? She'll go to sleep at the wheel.
CY: Spaceships don't have wheels. Eddie.
EDDIE: You never know with this group.
ROGER: Navigation will certainty be a difficult task.
You'll have to do it completely without instrumentation, you know. Mona, because the alien flying saucer is so ef- fectively shielded it can't be picked up by radar, sonar, telescope, microscope, satellite, search-lights or blood- hound.
LUCY: Then like how do they know it's even up there?
ROGER: It's completely visible to the naked eye.
LUCY: Oh.
ROGER: And that means our spaceship will need windows so we
can see where we're going.
EDDIE: Windows? In a spaceship?
ROGER: And responsibility for windows goes to... Cy Nusitis
of Optometry.
CHESTER: You can't put someone from Optometry in charge of windows. He'll make them prescription tenses.
MONA: When the sun shines through them it'll burn holes in
the instrument panels.
CY: It won't be that bad. Looks for the first fed weeks
we'll only have the windows in for an hour or so a day,
then we'll gradually increase it to two...
ROGER: We still have to figure out who's going to be in
charge of the actual construction of the ship. And that
goes to... Chester Field of Math.
EDDIE: You mean a mathie's going to be wearing the hard hat
on this job? Sandford Fleming must be rolling over in
his grave.
ROGER: What about it. Chester? Do you think you can handle
it?
CHESTER: The only thing I will promise is to make an honest
attempt.
ROGER: And that only leaves us with personnel to take care
of, and that job naturally falls to me, Roger Witco, with all my experience in Recreation.., or am I in Leisure
Studies? Well, it doesn't matter, they're both next of
Kin. And now, we're going to need help with all this;
and the best place to look for volunteers might be that
disco the musicians were talking about.
POLLY: (IN DISGUST) Are you suggesting we go to a disco?
ROGER: Where better to took for suckers?
POLLY: That's a point.
ROGER: And when we have the volunteers we need...

EL-1] (WE OPEN ON THE DISCO. GREAT HORDES OF PEOPLE. VINCE
MATHNEWS SITS AT A TABLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM THAT
LOOKS SUSPICIOUSLY LIKE THE COMPUTER CONSOLE FROM 1-4.)
VINCE MATHNEWS: Hello babies, this is your old pat. Vince
Mathnews. the King of Cool and the Sheikh of ocities,
spinning you the latest, greatest, and sedatest hits to
knock your socks off and loosen the rest of your
clothing, So get down, get up, and get funky as Studio
/360 lays it on you with our first knock-out numoer
Boogie Woogie Oogie Loogie Moogie Noogie Shoogie, which is SwahiLi for "Don't flagellate that platypus, the fault was mine." And here we go!
ES - 1] (HE PUSHES A BUTTON. WE HEAR A LOUD WHINE, THEN AN
EXPLOSION.)
Hey what happened?
(DEAN PAT ANSWER STICKS HER HEAD OUT OF THE SOUND BOOTH.)
DEAN PAT ANSWER: Sorry. Vince, the speaker system just blew
out. I don't think it could live with what we were
asking it to play.
VINCE: See if you can fix it, tassel head. And while my
friend up there is soothing the vibes, why don't the rest of you folks hustle off to the bar in the next room where you can get tight, get loose and get lucky. We'll have our act together in a few short parsecs.
(THE CROWD DISPERSES, LEAVING THE ALIENS BEHIND. THEY ARE
HOLDING FILLED CHAMPAGNE GLASSES.)
SOPHOCLES: Hah! The Earthlings suspect nothing. With our
perfect mastery of human habits none of these inferior beings will ever be able to tell we are invaders from the glorious planet Bonzo Cat.
(MEOWS.)
Thank you. And now, a toast to out superb disguises.
(THEY RAISE THEIR GLASSES AND DRINK KITTY STYLE.)
ABSURDITIES: Boss, tell me again; what are we here in the
disco for?
SOPHOCLES: Honestly, Absurdities, must you so blatantly
pander to the slower members of the audience? We're here to capture Earthlings in the hopes that one of them will be able to telt us where the formula for the Milk of Am- nesia is.
EURIPIDES: But how are we going to do that. Boss?
SOPHOCLES: Tell him. Aristophanes.
ARISTOPHANES: Its really quite simple. In the middle of
this dance floor we have placed an invisible disc which
will temporarily freeze anyone who steps on it. Then we
can carry off the victim to our PRG headquarters and
interrogate him or her at our leisure.
EURIPIDES: How does this temporary freezing disc work?
ARISTOPHANES: It traps the victim in a small time-warp.
EURIPIDES: A time-warp? That's astounding.
ABSURDITIES: Where is this invisible time-warp disc anyway?
ARISTOPHANES: I think it's just a jump to your left.., or
is it a step to your right?
ES-2] (ABSURDITIES HAS BEEN FOLLOWING THESE INSTRUCTIONS.
SUDDENLY THERE IS A STRANGE TWANG AND HE FREEZES IN AN
AWKWARD POSITION.)
That's it.
SOPHOCLES: Enough of this nonsense. Time is fleeting and
I've got to take control. Everyone into the shadows and
skulk.
(THEY WITHDRAW INTO THE SHADOWS, CARRYING THE FROZEN
ABSURDITIES. ENTER PRESIDENT SINCERE, NOAH VAIL, AND THE
FOUR DEANS.)
PRESIDENT SINCLAIR SINCERE: What a mess! Opening night and
our speakers self-destruct. Where did you buy those
things anyway?
DEAN JERRY ATRIC: Got 'em cheap from a guy named Mr.Phelps.
DEAN EUGENE SARDIRTY: So much for making money at the
disco.
NOAH VAIL: Now don't be so negative. We proved ayes ago
that university students would pay outrageous prices to sit in cramped quarters and drink, no matter how bad the sound system was.
DEAN CONSTANCE INTERRUPTION: That's true.
NOAH: Furthermore, there's a chance we'll be able to scrape
up some sort of music here sooner or later.
PAT: Yes. I've noticed a strange tendency in the Past
little while for seemingly normal people to burst into
song at the least provocation.
NOAH: And lastly of courser even if this turns out to be a
floppy disco, we've still got the Milk of Amnesia to fall back on.
CONSTANCE: (SINCERELY:) Wouldn't that be a little damp?
EUGENE: All we need right now is to capture a typical stu-
dent. Then we can spirit him away to the PRG buildinj so that when Professor Lactic gets us the Milk, we'll nave a guinea pig ready.
JERRY: How are we going to capture this student?
NOAH: I've taken care of that. Since we all know that
university administrators are completely incapable of
doing anything right. I've hired a group of outside as-
sistants.
(HE GESTURES OFFSTAGE. COUNT OFF ENTERS WITH HIS FLUN(IES.)
Deans, this is the famous Transylvanian Abduction and
Lechery League. They call it TALL for short. And this
is their illustrious leader. Count Off.
EMILE INITSELF: One.
JOAN OF ARC-WELDING: Two.
OTTO MECHANIC: Three.
JOY TOTHEWORLD: Four.
SAMSON EYDT: Five.
GAIL FORCE: Six.
COUNT OFF: Good evening.
SINCLAIR: Count Off?
EMILE: One.
JOAN: Two.
OTTO: Three.
JOY: Four.
SAMSON: Five.
GAIL: Six.
COUNT: Yes?
SINCLAIR: Have you decided how you're going to capture our
guinea pigs?
COUNT: Quite simple. I have hidden an invisible disc on
the dance floor and whenever anyone steps on it...
NOAH: They'll be temporarily frozen in a time-warp?
COUNT: What kind of sucker do you think I am? What happens
is that the lights go off. Then my assistants and I wilt
leap out of the shadows and capture the victim under
cover of darkness.
SINCLAIR: I see. Welt then, good tuck. Count Off.
EMILE: One.
JOAN: Two.
OTTO: Three.
JOY: Four.
SAMSON: Five.
GAIL: Six.
COUNT: Thank you.
(THE TRANSYLVANIANS WITHDRAW A MOMENT.)

GAIL: Six.
SAMSON: Five.
JOY: Four.
OTTO: Three.
JOAN: Two.
EMILE: One.
COUNT: Yes?
JERRY: Why do you talk with that funny accent?
COUNT: So people won't know I'm from Oshawa.
(ONCE AGAIN THE TRANSYLVANIANS LEAVE.)
SINCLAIR: (BEGINNING TO EXIT TOO:) You know, I Like the
count, but those assistants of his are just toadying up
to him. Don't you just hate "yes" men?
JERRY: Yes.
CONSTANCE: Yes.
PAT: Yes.
EUGENE: Yes.
NOAH: Me too.
(THEY EXIT. HAILEY AND ENTERS WITH LACTIC WHO CARRIES A
LARGE WHISKEY BOTTLE.)
HAILEY PHILIPS: Professors you've got to stop drinking like
this.
PROFESSOR LACTIC: How do you want me to drink? Like this?
(HE DRINKS KITTY STYLE.)
HAILEY: Professor, if you keep this up, you'll be in no
shape for your lecture first thing tomorrow morning.
LACTIC: What lecture? I've been fired.
HAILEY: Nonsense. I was talking to President Sincere just
a few minutes agog and he said you haven't been fired,
you've merely been taken off the payroll.
LACTIC: Oh?
HAILEY: That's right. You still have to teach all your
classes, you just won't get paid.
LACTIC: Silly me... and here I was drinking myself under
the table because I thought I Lost my job. Well this
calls for a celebration. (HE TAKES A LARGE SWIG FROM HIS
BOTTLE.) By the way, how are you doing on that Milk of
Amnesia stuff?
HAILEY: You'll be happy to know I managed to analyse it
this afternoon.
(THE CATS COME OUT OF THE SHADOW, ALL EARS.)
LACTIC: Hey great; give me the formula.
HAILEY: I don't have it with me. Professor.
(THE ALIENS WITHDRAW AGAIN.)
But don't worry. I've got it stored in a safe place. LACTIC: Where?
(THE ALIENS MOVE UP AGAIN.)
HAILEY: I'd better not say.., the walls have ears.
LACTIC: Yeah, those architects design some of the damnedest
decorations these days.
HAILEY: By the way. Professor, have you seen Smedley here
tonight?
LACTIC: You're kind of stuck on the boy, aren't you.
Hai ley?
HAILEY: That's because he wears so much Velcro.
LACTIC: The last time I saw him he was planning to throw
himself into the PRG furnace to see if he was super
enough to withstand the flame.
HAILEY: Good heavens, he'll make an ash of himself.
LACTIC: Don't worry, the furnace wasn't burning. Some sort
of labour dispute - the management has alienated all the
coat shovellers.
HAILEY: That's a relief.
LACTIC: Isn't it. And now if you'll excuse me. I think
I'll pass out into a conveniently timed stupor. (HE
DOES.)
HAILEY: Professor? Professor Lactic? (SHE TRIES TO ROJSE
HIM.)
SOPHOCLES: (COMING FORWARD) You heard herr, cats. She knows
where the formula for the milk is. We have to kitty-nap
her.
EURIPIDES: But Boss, how can we get her to step on the
time-warp disc?
ABSURDITIES: I bet I can do it.
ARISTOPHANES: Bet? Did you say BET?
SOPHOCLES: Absurdities. I do wish you'd pick your words
more carefully.
ABSURDITIES: Forget about that, boss, just watch me hustle
the carbon-based life unit. (HE APPROACHES HAILEY,
WASHING HIMSELF KITTY-STYLE.) Hey, what's new. pussycat?
HAILEY: I beg your pardon?
ABSURDITIES: Can I buy you a cream? Maybe a little liver
and egg?
HAILEY: Do I know you?
ABSURDITIES: Maybe not now, but the night's still young.
HAILEY: Are you trying to pick me up?
ABSURDITIES: (Hey, I'd never touch your Tender Vittles.)
Hey, nothing as crude as that. I figure we'll dance a
little here, then we'll go over to Miss Mew's for some
Chow, and later if you feel a Little Friskie we'll head
back to my place for the time of your Nine Lives.
HAILEY: I don't think I want to dance with you.
ABSURDITIES: Hey, I'm new in the city and I'm not so very
witty, but it sure would be a pity to be turned down oy a kitty, so won't you dance an itty bitty if they play a
pretty ditty? Hey baby, that's-a what I like.
HAILEY: But the music system's broken.
ABSURDITIES: Who wants to listen to that caterwauling any-
way? Let's boogie.
(HE GRABS HER AND THEY BEGIN TO TANGO. HAILEY LIFTS HIM UP
SO THAT HE CAN DANCE WITH HIS FEET OFF THE FLOOR. MEANWHILE
THE AIA APPEARS.)
EDDIE MATCH: So this is the disco.
CHESTER FIELD: Where is everybody?
POLLY SYLLABIC: Perhaps the campus has been struck by a
sudden plague of good taste.
CY NUSITIS: But how are we going to find volunteers to
build our spaceship if there's hardly anybody here?
MONA NUCLEOSIS: Who cares about the old spaceship anyway?
I've come here to have fun. (SHE IMMEDIATELY SLUMPS DOWN
ASLEEP.)
ROGER WILCO: Mona, wake up! Mona! Mona!
LACTIC: (WAKING) Stop that racket, boy, or you'll get us
all killed.
ROGER: Killed?
LACTIC: Certainly. Don't you know about... IT?
ROGER: It? Well my father gave me a tittle talk the night
before I took Ginny Sue Harper to the prom...
LACTIC: Not that It, the other IT. The thing that sleeps
beneath the campus.
(SIGN FROM BEHIND THE PIANO. "DRAMATIC FORESHADOWING".) LUCY DIAMONDSKI: Like wow, you mean the janitorial staff?
LACTIC: I mean the monster! Legend has it that deep below
the earth is the lair of a horrible creature, dormant for eons but destined to wake and wreak fearsome havoc if its steep is ever disturbed.
MONA: (SLEEPILY) I don't blame it.
LACTIC: If we make the slightest amount of ruckus we run
the risk of reviving a primordial force of evil which
will destroy us all!
POLLY: Then it was certainly a bright move to start a disco
down here, wasn't it? It'll make enough noise to raise
the Grateful Dead.
LACTIC: Don't blame me. When they asked me about phasing
out the Computer Science Department. I told them to use
the Red Room here for a squash court.
ROGER: Look, we don't have time for this nonsense. We have
to find volunteers to work on the spaceship. Cy, you
stay here. The rest of us will go looking next door.
CY: Roger. Roger.
(THE AIA LEAVE, EXCEPT FOR CV.)
I don't know why I came tonight... I've got a horriole
cold.., and this red room is so drafty... hey, look at
this, an invisible disc on the floor.
HAILEY: (BREAKING AWAY FROM ABSURDITIES:) How can you tell
there's an invisible disc there?
CV: Because I can't see it!
HAILEY: Oh.
CV: As a matter of fact, there's another invisible disc
right by your foot.
ABSURDITIES: I'm so glad you pointed it out for me.
Earthling. I've been looking all over for that thing.
HAILEY: I wonder what happens when you step on an invisiote
disc.
CV: Only one way to find out.
CL - 2] (CV AND HAILEY STEP ONTO THEIR RESPECTIVE INVISI3LE
DISCS TOGETHER. THERE IS A STRANGE TWANG AND THE LIGHTS GU
OFF. A MOMENT LATER THE LIGHTS COME UP ON A STAGE THAT IS
CLEAR, EXCEPT FOR LACTIC ASLEEP AND ABSURDITIES FROZEN IN AN ABSURD POSITION. SMEDLEY ENTERS ON THE RUN.)
SMEDLEY MERKIN: Here I come to save the day!
(OF COURSE HE FOULS UP AGAIN. LOIS AND SHARON ENTER BEHIND HIM.)
SHARON SHARALIKE: Why does he always enter a room tike
that?
LOIS BIDDER: A bad habit he picked up from Mighty Mouse
cartoons.
ABSURDITIES: (UNFREEZING) Mighty Mouse? Meowwwwww! (HE
RUNS OFF THE STAGE IN FEAR.)
SMEDLEY: That's funny. I thought Haitey was going to ue
here.
LOIS: Maybe she got tired of waiting for us and went home.
SHARON: I don't think so. You know, she's blindly in love
with Smedley. Although, to be in love with Smebtey you
not only have to be blind, but * deaf and dumb as welt.
LOIS: Pardon?
LACTIC: (WAKING UP) Smedley, is that you?
SMEDLEY: No, it's me, Smedley. What can I do for you,
Professor?
LACTIC: Come here. (SMEDLEY DOES. LACTIC WHISPERS) Smed-
ley. Hailey tells me she's pinned down the formula for
the Milk of Amnesia. I don't suppose you could go over
to the lab tonight and whip me up a batch?
SMEDLEY: What for?
LACTIC: Welt... I want to give it to my class tomorrow
morning.
SMEDLEY: Your class? But then they'll forget everything
they've learned from you.
LACTIC: Exactly. You see, I'm in a bit of a bind. Last
week by mistake I taught the Math students to read and
the Arts students to count.
SMEDLEY: So what?
LACTIC: Reading is a graduate course for mathies, and we
all know Arts students don't count.
(EXTENDED TOLERANT PAUSE, WAITING FOR AUDIENCE TO STOP
APPLAUDING AND REGAIN COMPOSURE.)
If the administration finds out about such a grave viola- tion of university policy, the consequences would be too unspeakable to speak about.
SMEDLEY: Holy incomprehensible. Professor! Don't worry.
Lois and I will go over to the lab right away and make up all the Milk of Amnesia you'll need.
LACTIC: You're a good Lad. Smedley. Not much of a dresser,
but a good lad.
SMEDLEY: Come on, Lois, we have to hit the tab.
LOIS: Smedley, I do wish you'd leave that poor dog alone.
(THEY EXIT.)
SHARON: Hey, wait a second!
(THE AIA ENTER.)
ROGER: I just can't understand it. Why isn't anyone in-
terested in spending hours of hard work building a
second-rate spaceship to attack a group of aliens who
possess weaponry far beyond the range of human science?
POLLY: Maybe after the first few invasions, the novelty
wears off?
ROGER: You there, what's your name?
SHARON: Sharon Sharalike.
ROGER: Would you enjoy being annihilated by alien tyrants?
SHARON: Not on my first date.
ROGER: Good enough, you're on our side. Eddie, don't let
her get away.
(THEY GRAB HER ROUGHLY. SHARON BEGINS TO SCREAM.)
LACTIC: Will you people be quiet? I've told you how
dangerous it is to make noise down here.
(ENTER THE VAST HORDES OF DISCOITES NOISILY.)
VINCE: Hey babies, polish your shoes and banish those blues
because Studio /360 has arranged some powerful vibrations for you, even though our speakers are shot to Halifax.
Yes cats. it's the Do-It-Yourself Hustle, an absolute
miracle of the modern age of conformity. because com-
pletely off the cuff and witout prior rehearsal, this
whole crowd is going to break into song. Can you dig it?
LACTIC: No, no, you can't let them do it.
VINCE: On your marks, get down, and boogie!
LACTIC: Stop, stop, you'll wake the monster.
(AS THE CROWD SINGS AND DANCES, LACTIC WILL CONTINUE TO TRY
TO STOP THEM, FIGHTING WITH VINCE IN PARTICULAR.)

RIGHT CORNER. LACTIC ENTERS AND GOES UP TO THE BOARD. TO
INSURE THAT THE STUDENTS ARE FULLY AWAKE THE PROF SCRATCHES
HIS FINGERNAILS DOWN THE BOARD. THE STUDENTS ARE DRESSED IN
GYM SUITS AND PAC WRIST BANDS. AS THE STUDENTS WAKE, THE
LIGHTS ARE BROUGHT UP FROM HALF LIGHT.)
SHARON SHARALIKE: I've never had this prof before; what are
his classes like?
LOIS BIDDER: Well, most of the time you can't understand
what he's talking about.
SHARON: Why is that?
LOIS: Half the courses he doesn't like, and the other half
he doesn't know.
SHARON: Then what is he doing teaching us?
LOIS: Teaching us? He teaches everybody. Because of the
cutbacks in education, he's the only prof left, all the
others have been fired or sent to Borneo. What he Joes
is to split his time between Arts. Math, Science. and
Engineering.
SHARON: That's terrible! He doesn't teach the Kin people
anything!
LOIS: Never could teach the Kin people anything. He's okay
most of the time, until he starts doing mathematical
proofs on works of literature. I remember the time he
proved by induction on the number of cocker spaniels in
Newfoundland that Farley Mowat was actually Margaret
Thatcher in disguise.
(A BASKETBALL PLAYER RUSHES THROUGH DRIBBLING. AN OPPOSING
BASKETBALL PLAYER WITH A WHITE CANE AND SUNGLASSES FOLLOWS.)
There are a few drawbacks to having classes here in the
gym.
SHARON: Yes. What was that?
MORLEY REPREHENSIBLE: I think it was the Warriors versus
the local blind school. Charity game. But it's the only
kind the Warriors can get.
(THE BLIND BASKETBALLER RETURNS, THIS TIME WITH THE BALL. A
SHORT TIME LATER THE WARRIOR PLAYER ALSO RETURNS, IMPALED
WITH THE BLIND PLAYER'S WHITE CANE.)
ORAL HYGIENE: It was even worse here a little while ago, we
had to bring tokens to be Let into the building and carry towels around. Fortunately, they finally cut out the towel service, but we still have to wear the stupid arm- bands.

PROFESSOR LANCE LACTIC: Now for today's lectures we'll do
the usual things, anatomy, math, biology, physics, brain surgery, graft theory and of course basketweaving and the rest of the regular arts courses. Now. I think I'll
start with Fantastic Friction-Free Fun with Fabulous
Physics.
JOE SFX: Yahh! Yahh, Yahh! Yahh!
(JOE SFX JUMPS UP AND STARTS KARATE KICKING THE AIR, WITH THE APPROPRIATE NOISES TO GO ALONG WITH IT. HE SITS BACK DOWN IN HIS LOTUS POSITION AND STARES BACK OUT INTO SPACE.)
LACTIC: Thanks, Joe.
SHARON: Don't tell me, he's the class nut, right?
LOIS: Ibe nut? He's just Qcie of the nuts. Poor Joe always
does that whenever he hears alliteration. It's a
peculiar problem, and perfectly perplexing how he picked
it up.
JOE: Yeahh! Yeahh! Yeahh! (ETC.)
NATALIE ATTIRED: If you think that's bad, Ella over there
goes into hysterics whenever she hears.., well whenever
she hears the antonym for passing.
SHARON: You mean if someone says the word fail?
ELLA FANTSTRUNK: Fail!! Oh No!
(ELLA PROCEEDS TO BLUBBER, WHICH SHE WILL DO WHENEVER SHE
HEARS THE WORD "FAIL")
NATALIE: Tell me Sharon, are all your family clever?
(PRESIDENT SINCLAIR SINCERE APPEARS BEHIND THE BLACK6OARo.)
PRESIDENT SINCLAIR SINCERE: Excuse me. professor. Could I
have a moment of your time to introduce you to your
newest student?
LACTIC: President Sincere! What are you doing out of your
office? I thought that you were just a figurehead around
here and that BURT 9000 did all the real work.
SINCLAIR: I am, he did, but he won't.
LACTIC: Pardon?
SINCLAIR: I have to learn the ropes because the BURT 9300
is resigning in July.
MORLEY: I've never heard of a computer just dumping you
like that.
ORAL: Ever been on WIDJET?
LACTIC: I don't understand. What bigger, more lucrative
and profitable job is there besides being president of a university?
SINCLAIR: The BURT 9000 is moving to student lot A to con-
trol the pay parking gate.
LACTIC: One minute he's president of the University, and
the next minute he's confined to quarters.
SINCLAIR: Professor, here is your new student.

SHEILAH: If you'd been sober last night, you would have

going to argue with him.
LACTIC: What do you think I'm going to teach that thing?

LACTIC: But I don't teach Music!

that in your lectures you refrain from using words such

CS-3] (APE GROWLS FOR EACH OF THE SIMIAN WORDS THAT FOLLOW:) "monkey". (GROWL) "ape". (GROWL) or "gorilla" (GROWL). LACTIC: What about basketweaving?
[5-4] (APE GROWLS.)
(SHRUGS) I just wanted to see if he was in Arts.
SINCLAIR: In fact. there should be no reference, no matter
how vague, to his species.
C5-5] (APE GROWLS.)
With your help. Professor. I think Mr.Mungus-Ape can
become a Big Man on Campus.
[5-6] ("00H-00H" MONKEY NOISES FROM THE SOUND MAN.)
(ASIDE:) And you'd better not disappoint us. Lance; that
chimp is worth more BIU's than all the rest of the stu-
dents out together. (NOT ASIDE:) Well. so Long for now
kids, I guess I've gotta baboon.
CS-7] (APE GROWLS. SINCLAIR EXITS.)
LACTIC: Right. Let's get on with the questions from the
last Physics midterm. Question 1: If you have a 2
kilogram counterweight of negligible mass attached to one
end of a frictionless rope and the rope is strung over a
Canadian Tire pulley at S.T.P., what happens when a non-
conducting 1.5 kilogram monkey tries to...
[5-8] (APE GROWLS.)
Sorry! Question 2: Consider a perfectly elastic,
isotropic, homogeneous, insulated, non-conducting,
evacuated sphere of negligible cross-sectional area,
dielectric constant of one, permittivity of zero, non-
rotating with zero velocity and zero charger located at
the origin of co-ordinates of an infinite-dimensiolat space, in an inertial reference frame separated by an in- finite distance from all other objects, at equilibrium in a constant conservative field, at the absolute zero of temperature.
(AS HE DOES THE ABOVE PREAMBLE, HE GOES TO LEAN ON THE DOORJAMB, MISSES, AND FALLS OUT OF THE ROOM.)
LOIS: Well, what do you think of him?
SHARON: I think the University is losing its Faculties.
What are his qualifications anyway?
MORLEY: He invented Muzak, among other things.
SHARON: I've always been afraid that the person who thought
up Muzak would think of something else. What else did he
do?
ORAL: WIDJET.

END OF SONG
LACTIC: (REVIVING:) Stop that singing!
STUDENTS: Surety.
LACTIC: I fail to see why it is so hard for students...
ELLA: Fait! Oh No! (SHE STARTS CRYING AGAIN)
(END-PERIOD GONG.)
LACTIC: Well, that gong means its time for the next class.
so I think we'll move on to Anthropology.
CS-9] (APE GROWLS.)
Make that Psychology. Psychology: A Child's Garden of
Freudian Slips.
(OPENS TEXT. SLIP FALLS OUT. PERIOD GONG.)
Well, enough of that. (THROWS SLIP ASIDE.) On to Impure
Math. Today. I'll prove Fermat's Last Theorem.
SHEILAH: But sir, Fermat's Last Theorem has never ever been
proved!
LACTIC: Never, eh? In that case. I'll assign it for
homework. Are there any questions on anything else.
then?
NATALIE: Yes. I'd like to ask a question about "The Decline
and Fall of the Roman Empire".
LACTIC: Oh, you mean the book by Edward Gibbon?
ES-103 (APE GROWL.)
Question over-ruled!
(PERIOD GONG.)
Now for Chemistry. Those of you who survived last week's
lab demonstration of nuclear fission will probably recall that when we add Chemical "A" to Chemical "B" (LACTIC DOES THIS:) you get this reaction.
ES-113 (BEAKER IS FOAMING MADLY. LACTIC HANDS IT TO A
STUDENT AND POINTS HER OUT THE DOOR. CHEMICAL EXPLOSION.)
Nice to know nothing has changed, isn't it? That's what
I like about science, it's so predictable.
(PERIOD GONG.)
Next, English. As you all know, before we turned the Red
Room into a disco. the Computer Science Department
replaced the English Language Proficiency Exam with
WATLISH. WATLISH is, of course. programmed Shakespeare
by flow chart. Lesson 1: Hamlet. Goto "B" or not goto
"3", that is the question!
(PERIOD GONG.)
On to Sociology. Have you all read the Encyclopaedia I
assigned yesterday?
MORLEY: Read? We're only in first year.
LOIS: How fantastically foolish I find first-year frosh.
JOE: Yahh! Yahh! (KARATE KICKS AND YELLS AGAIN.)
SHARON: Who is that guy anyway?
ORAL: Oh that's Joe...
(JOE MAKES A NOISE FOR HIS LAST NAME: BEEP!) SHARON: Joe Who?
SHEILAH: No, Joe Who runs the pumps down at the new Petro-
Can station on the corner. The owner hasn't the heart to
tell him it's a self-serve.
NATALIE: I heard a rumour that Joe's wife's pregnant.
SHEILAH: I don't think it's Tru-Deau.
ORAL: It was a real surprise; when Joe found out apout it,
he almost N.D.Peed his pants.
LACTIC: I will not have people talking during my Sociology
class. Shut up and sit down. or I won't give any of you
a Social Credit.
(PERIOD GONG.)
And now it's time for Political Science. We'll begin oy
looking at some prominent politicians.
[S-123 (APE GROWLS.)
Hey! Come on; you're only supposed to growl at
references to lower primates. I said "politicians".
CS-133 (APE GROWLS.)
You do have a point. (PERIOD GONG.)
Well, that brings us back to Math. Since I haven't had
time to prepare a lecture, we'll have a midterm. Ques-
tion One: A five hundred pound man is sailing away from
a lighthouse due north by northwest at a speed of three
parsecs, so how fast is his shadow rotating when tne
trains collide?
(PERIOD GONG.)
Okay, hand in your papers.
(MUCH BLANK PAPER IS CRUMPLED AND THROWN AT THE PROF.)
Music now. Everyone get out their song sheets and we'll
sing selection NCC-1701, "Chewbacca My Heart Go Boom-
Boom-Boom". or "I've Been Wookie on the Railroad".
[5-143 (APE GROWLS.)
Sorry! Maybe you'd better sing it Solo.
(PERIOD GONG.)
And now, my favourite subject: Statistics!
(STUDENTS INSTANTLY FALL OVER BACKWARDS AND START SNORING.)
It's my favourite because I don't have to teach a thing.
ALL anyone has to remember is that 90 percent of ail
statistics is caused by cigarette smoking.
(PERIOD GONG. PROF THROWS BOOK AWAY RELIEVED.)
Biology time. You'll remember last week we crossed a
laborador retriever with a greyhound and got a dog that fetches birds but charges bus fare. For today's first
experiment, we recombine the building block of life:
D.N.A. (DEMONSTRATES WITH BUILDING BLOCKS.) And we get:
N.A.D. For our next experiment, using only compass and
straightedge, we bisect a frog. But first. I'd like to
introduce an alternate life-form based on silly putty,
one of my grad students. Smedley Merkin. (PROF TENDERS
POINTER IN SMEDLEY'S DIRECTION:) Take it away. Smedley.
(SMEDLEY TAKES THE PROF'S POINTER AWAY AND LEAVES.)
Bring it back, Smediey. Do you have the Milk of Amnesia
with you?
(SMEDLEY PROFFERS A CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE WITH MILK IN IT.) SMEDLEY MERKIN: I forget.
LACTIC: Good lad. I want you to feed it to the class.
SMEDLEY: Why?
LACTIC: They haven't paid off their student loans, and
their education is being re-possessed. Now, I think
we've had enough of Biology...
(PERIOD GONG. SMEDLEY POURS MILK FOR THE CLASS.)
which means it's time for Wine Tasting. Drink up,
kids, it's good for what's Alien you.
STUDENTS:
************************************************************ ***** I FORGET WITH YOU MILK *****
***** (to the tune of:) *****
***** THANK YOU VERY MUCH MILK *****
************************************************************
Suddenly the memory stops
My mind is wiped quite clear There's nothing left inside my head
It's Like back in first year
I forget with you (ahhh...) Milk.
Thoroughly this memory soap
Goes rinsing through my brain
And all the things I thought I knew Are washed right down the drain
I forget with you (ahhh...) Milk. La La la la La (uhhh...) la.
END OF SONG
LACTIC: Smedley! Where's my coffee?
(SMEDLEY BRINGS THE COFFEE AND LACTIC TASTES IT.) There's not enough cream in this.
(SMEDLEY GOES TO ADD MILK FROM THE CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE.) Not that cream!
SMEDLEY: It's the cream I've been using all along.
LACTIC: You put Milk of Amnesia in my coffee! You meat-
ball!
SMEDLEY: Hey, forgive and forget.
LACTIC: Now I've only got two minutes to write down
everything I know.
SMEDLEY: That gives you a whole minute to check your work.
LACTIC: Stop it! This is serious! That Milk will make all
of us forget our entire University education!
MORLEY: And you fed it to us?! You...

LIGHTNING.)
[S-1] (IN THE BACKGROUND ARE SOUNDS OF THUNDER. TODD HOTTY
SITS AT A DESK, CLUTCHING THE MICROPHONE OF A CASSETTE TAPE
RECORDER IN HIS HAND. THERE IS NOTHING ON THE DESK BUT A
TELEPHONE, A PEN, AND A PAD OF PAPER. THERE IS A TELEPHONE
SWITCHBOARD CLOSE AT HAND. THERE IS ALSO A DARTBOARD
HANGING IN A VISIBLE PLACE; ATTACHED TO IT BY A NUMBER OF
DARTS ISA PICTURE OF JERRY.)
TODD HOTTY: (FRANTICALLY INTO THE MICROPHONE:) Listen,
whoever hears this, you've got to help me. I'm being
held prisoner in the correspondence program office. They're torturing me to tell them everything I know about twelfth century Italian literature. and I can't hold out
much Longer. You have to call the police and have them raid the place soon or else.., oh no, I hear them coming now. They'll kill me if they find me here. Hurry.
Please. Get the police.., oh no...
(THE DOOR SLAMS OPEN. TODD SCREAMS LOUDLY, THEN CLICKS OFF
THE TAPE RECORDER. SUE ZAFONE ENTERS WEARING A RAINCOAT AND
JUST CLOSING UP AN UMBRELLA.)
SUE ZAFONE: Hi Todd.
TODD: Hi Sue. Rotten weather. eh?
SUE: Raining cats and dogs. (SHE LOOKS DOWN AT HER SHOE.)
And I just stepped in a poodle.
(SHE WIPES HER SHOE OFF ON ONE OF THE STEPS.)
TODD: Could be worse. Could be hailing taxi cabs.
SUE: Any calls while I was gone?
TODD: Just one - some jerk wanted the suicide hottine. His
girlfriend just dumped him and he was thinking of ending
it all.
SUE: Did you put him through?
TODD: Nahh, just told him to take two bottles of aspirin
and call me in the morning.
CS-2] (THE PHONE RINGS. SUE ANSWERS IT.)
SUE: Hello, University Switchboard. No. I'm sorry. I can't
Put any calls through after eight a.m. New curfew. I
guess I could take a message. (SHE GETS THE PEN AND PAD
OF PAPER.) What was the name? Ms.L.Bug. And the mes-
sage? Fly away homer your house is on fire, your chil-
dren alone. Right, thank you very much. Good-bye,
(SHE HANGS UP, TEARS THE SHEET OFF THE PAD, CRUMPLES IT INTO A BALL AND TOSSES IT INTO THE WASTEPAPER BASKET.)
Welt, thanks for filling in for me. Todd.
TODD: Do you have a second to help me with one of my tapes?
SUE: Sure.
TODD: Great.
(HE HANDS HER A SCRIPT.)
You can be the little girl.
SUE: Okay. What course is this for?
TODD: Criticism of anatomy. Right, I'll read the prof's
tines. Here goes.
(HE STICKS A CASSETTE INTO THE RECORDER AND TURNS IT N.
WHEN NEXT HE SPEAKS IT IS IN AN ARTIFICIAL HARUMPHY VOICE.)
And so as you can see on your anatomy charts, the hip
bone is connected to the thigh bone, the thigh bone is
connected to the knee bone...

what?
TODD: Jenny darlings daddy's busy right now tapin a Lec-

SUE: But daddy. I've just been to the dentist and I hardly
had any cavities!
TODD: No cavities? Gosh it realty does pay to brush with
Brillo!
(HE CLICKS OFF THE RECORDER.)
Thanks Sue. that's all I need you for. I can finish this
later.
SUE: Any time. Todd. Bye-bye; have fun.
TODD: I will.

JERRY OTZOVDAGODS: Worst snowstorm I've ever seen.
ES-4] (THUNDER AND LIGHTNING.)
Strangest snowstorm I've ever seen too.
(ENTHUSIASTICALLY) Hi Sue.
SUE: (NOT ENTHUSIASTICALLY) Hi Jerry.
JERRY:, Bet you've missed me these past few days. SUE: Only once or twice.
(SHE STANDS. DRAWS THE DART GUN AND SHOOTS A DART AT JERRY'S PICTURE. THE DART STICKS. MOST OF THE TIME.)
I thought you might have been run over by a snowplow. JERRY: Run over by a snowplow!
SUE: One can always hope for the best. I do wish you'd
give up on me. Jerry.
JERRY: Sue. I worship the ground you walk on!
SUE: Is that so? Welt. I walked across the train tracks
this morning. Why don't you go down there and abase
yourself for a while?
JERRY: Sometimes you're horribly cruel. Sue.
SUE: Only to wimpish tittle nobodies like you. Jerry. I
can be extraordinarily charming when the situation merits it.
[S-53 (THE PHONE RINGS. SUE ANSWERS IT.)
Allo, comment ca va. Pardon? Ahh, je ne parte as
l'Angtais. monsieur. Non. non. Je le regrette beaucouP.
Non. ,je ne vous comprends pas. C'est dommage.
(SHE HANGS UP.)
You were saying?
JERRY: Sue. I love you!
SUE: So do I.
JERRY: I even took a Lousy work term job on campus just so
I could be close to you.
SUE: What kind of lousy job?
JERRY: I'm a bar code reader at the library.
SUE: I thought they had machines to do that.
JERRY: They found they could hire co-op students for less
money.
SUE: Welt, so what? I don't see that being a uar code
reader is that crummy a job. It's better than being a
co-op fire extinguisher.
(SHE BLOWS HARD ONCE OR TWICE.)
JERRY: But working conditions are the pits. We have to
crouch down under the check-out desks where people won't see us, and no matter how dark it is under there all we have to see with are these little pencil flashlights.
(HE PRODUCES A BAR CODE READER.)
SUE: You'll get used to it.
JERRY: And the regular librarians al( look down on you too.
SUE: They pretty well have to if you crouch under their
desks.
JERRY: Yesterday for a big joke they ran a zebra throagh
the system. By God. I thought someone was checking out
the entire Encyclopaedia Britannica. Just because we're
down on the floor, they treat us like dirt.
SUE: Us? Are you saying there are more people like you.
Jerry?
JERRY: ALL kinds of students have rotten jobs on campus. I
met a guy yesterday who was a co-op tree.
SUE: A what?
JERRY: Every day he plants himself by the ringroad and
pretends he's a hickory.
SUE: Fellow must be off his nut.
JERRY: Poor guy has a family of starlings in his hairs a
treefrog in his navel, and termites under his toenails.
SUE: I dare say he's bothered by dogs too.
JERRY: The dogs he can take, it's the woodpecker problem
that's really eating him.
SUE: Serves him right. Anyone who would sign up to be a
tree must be a sap.
JERRY: They didn't tell him he'd be a tree. They told him
he'd have a job in a branch plant of a growing business.
SUE: It still sounds like he was going out on a limb...
CS-63 (THE STAGE EXPLODES IN LOUD SIRENS. THE ACTORS SHOUT
OVER THE NOISE.)
JERRY: What's that?
SUE: The phone.
(SHE PICKS UP THE PHONE.)
Now hear this, you bloody aliens. Get off this line or
I'll run your antennae through an electric pencil shar-
pener. Got it?
(5-73 (THE NOISE STOPS ABRUPTLY.)
Sometimes you have to be firm with them. (ENTER TODD. RUNNING.)
TODD: Sue, what's going on in here?
SUE: Ahh, it's just the aliens again.
JERRY: What aliens?
SUE: The ones who've taken over the PRG. Every time they
radio up to their mother ship over the smokestack, it
sends the switchboard haywire.
TODD: How long has this been going on?

11:2 Page? F.A.S.S. 1980 80/03120- 19 :29
SUE: Ever since it began. Boy. was I mad the first time it
happened! I was listening in on this juicy obscene phone
call someone in Administration was making to Bette
Stephenson...
JERRY: You mean to say that aliens have taken over the PRG?
That's awful. (PAUSE) What's the PRG?

SUE: Bug off.

TODD: Say. Sue, who's your friend?
SUE: He's not my friend. he's Jerry.
TODD: Oh, this is the little jerk who's trying to get into
your... I mean, this is the charming young man who's
courting your favours.
SUE: That's him. Todd Hotty. meet Jerry Otzovdagods.
JERRY: Pleasure to meet you.
TODD: Yes, isn't it. Say. Jerry, maybe you can help me
with my work.
JERRY: What do you do?
TODD: Sabotage correspondence course tapes.
JERRY: Sabotage?
TODD: Well, let's just say I make them more interesting.
For example, listen to this.
[5-9] (HE PLUGS A TAPE INTO HIS RECORDER. WE HEAR VERY
RAPID SPEECH, DOUBLE SPEED. HE TURNS IT OFF AGAIN.)
JERRY: What was that?
TODD: My new version of the shorthand course. Look Jerry.
I could really use a new voice on some of these things.
JERRY: Why?
TODD: Security recognizes mine.
JERRY: Security! You mean I could get in trouble for tnis?
TODD: Absolutely.
JERRY: What?
11:2 Page? F.A.S.S. 1980 80/03120- 19 :29
11:2 Page? F.A.S.S. 1980 80/03120- 19 :29
SUE: Go ahead. Jerry, do it.
JERRY: All right then. Sue; for you. (BEGINNING TO SING)
I'd do anything for you. Sue. anything...
SUE: Stop singing.
JERRY: Surely.
TODD: I tell you what. I'll give you a screen test right
here and now. All you have to do is read this in your
best voice when I say the word.
(HE GIVES JERRY A PIECE OF PAPER.) Okay?
JERRY: Okay. For you. Sue.
TODD: (TURNING ON TAPE RECORDER) Go!
JERRY: How will the defenseless electron get out of this
one? With vicious inevitability the monstrous nucleus
exerts its hideous force on our heroine, dragging her to
a fate worse than annihilation at the atom's core, and
foreshadowing the collapse of the entire solar system
model! Can even quantum theory save her now? Tune in to
our next thrilling Lecture entitled. "The Old Orbital
Shell Game".
ES-103 (THE ALIEN SIRENS GO AGAIN.)
SUE: Oh hell. (SHE PICKS UP THE PHONE.) One more outburst
like this, TV-heads. and I'll run you through a
Cuisinart.
ES-113 (THE SIRENS STOP AND SHE SLAMS DOWN THE PHONE.) Little green menaces.
JERRY: What are aliens doing on campus?
SUE: Taking over the world, I expect. Isn't that generally
what aliens are interested in? Though why they want it.
I can't imagine.
JERRY: Don't you think we ought to do something?
SUE: Yes, you ought to leave. Ta-ta. Jerry, don't hurry
back.
JERRY: But Sue...
TODD: Come on, kid, you can help me with my work. You're a
natural.
JERRY: But...
TODD: No buts. I've got this great idea for a chemistry
lecture that doesn't quite work out. I can fake the ex-
plosion but I need someone for the professor's moans of
agony.
(HE DRAGS JERRY OUT WITH HIM.)
SUE: Good riddance. Now maybe I can get back to some
serious work.
(SHE PICKS UP THE PHONE AND DIALS.)
Hello madame, is your fridge running? Then you'd getter
catch it and tie it down, hadn't you?
(SHE HANGS UP AND CHUCKLES. THERE IS A KNOCK ON THE DOOR.)

OLIVIA NEWTON-FIG: Didn't Jerry explain what was going on?
SUE: Nothing is going on between me and Jerry.
OLIVIA: But he asked us all to come and serenade you.
SUE: I see. This is one of his romantic notions.
OLIVIA: It is romantic, isn't it?
SUE: It sucks.

Now where were we?
WENDY KOWICUMHOME: Where's Jerry?
SUE: I think he said he was going to join a monastery. A
silent order. You people might think about the same
thing, considering the quality of your singing.
WENDY: But Jerry said he'd wait for us here. He asked us
to come to serenade you when we finished work.
SUE: You work with Jerry? More co-op bar code readers.
PETER OUT: Not really. We're the library computer.

BJORN: So what do you want us to do?
SUE: Leave?
BJORN: No. I mean what do you want the computer to do?
SUE: What sort of things can it do?
BJORN: Anything a normal computer can. Crash, add, sub-
tract, crash, multiply, divides crash, take a dump...
SUE: Not here they don't.
BJORN: I know what! Why don't we find out what library
books you have out? We're quite good at that.
SUE: Then will you go away?
BJORN: If necessary. Now, the whole process starts over
here at Iona who reads the cards.
IONA CHEVY-PICKUP: (LOOKING AT A SPREAD OF CARDS) I see a
tall dark man in your future...
BJORN: Not those cards. Iona, these cards.
(HE PRODUCES SOME COMPUTER CARDS.)
IONA: How do you expect me to read those? Someone's cut a
bunch of holes in them.
BJORN: You're supposed to read the holes.
IONA: How can I read in something that isn't there?
SUE: English profs do it all the time.
BJORN: Look, all we have to do is tell the computer your
name one way or another, and it'll do the rest. What's
your name?
SUE: Sue Zafone,
BJORN: You heard that, Iona. Do a book check.
IONA: All right; here we go.

THROUGH HER NOSE AND WAVING THE FLASHING LIGHTS ABOUT.)
Information to go to Processing!
LEIF LETTUCE: Picking up information. Brrr000mm,
brrr000mmm...
(HE DRIVES HIS TRIKE TO IONA.)
IONA: Find Sue Zafone's library books.
LEIF: Where did she leave them Last?
IONA: Go to processing and find out what they are!
LEIF: Right. Brrr000mmm...
(HE RIDES OVER TO PETER.)
I have to find out what Sue Zafone's Library books are.
PETER: You'll need to look up the numbers on tape. Go to
it.
LEIF: Okay. Brrr000mmm...
(HE RIDES OVER TO ED.)
Find out Sue Zafone's book numbers.
ED CHEESE: (BEGINS TO READ OFF TAPE) The Dow Jones was

Consolidated Scuba is taking a bit of a dive... Julius
Schmidt is still a safe investment... ahh, here we are,
Sue Zafone's library books: 1028913, 1028914, and
1028915.
LEIF: Thanks. Brrr000mmm...
(HE PEDALS BACK TO PETER.) Got the numbers, chief.
PETER: Run them down to memory and find out what books they
are.
LEIF: Right. Brrr000mmm...

Okay, what's the title of book number 1028913? JILL BAIT: Just a second.
(SHE BEGINS TO EAT THE APPLE.)
SUE: What's she doing?
BJORN: Searching core for the right byte.
(JILL TAKES A dIG CHOMP OUT OF THE APPLE.) There, she's found it.
JILL: The title is "An Auto-Eroticism Handbook" by Harry
Palm.
SUE: Wait a second now, maybe it's not such a good idea for
you to know what I'm reading.
LEIF: Book number 1028914.
JILL: Naughty Nancy's Nightly Nooky by Hans Roving.
SUE: Stop this.
LEIF: Book number 1028915.

SUE: That's enough!
BJORN: But we haven't shown you our high speed printer yet.
SUE: I don't want to see it.
OLIVIA: Just as well. I'm getting writer's cramp.
SUE: The whole idea of a co-op computer is just the dumbest
thing I've ever heard.
BJORN: You may think it's stupid, but it's got the computer
companies scared. When DEC heard about it, they almost
PDP'd their pants.
SUE: Just get outs the bunch of you. I don't want to hear
any more...
C5-143 (THE SIRENS GO AGAIN.)
Oh beautiful. That's the last straw!
(SHE CHARGES TO THE TELEPHONE AND PICKS IT UP.)
All right, semaphore skulls, that's it. I'm coming over
there to make tittle green mincemeat out of you.
(SHE SLAMS DOWN THE PHONE. THE SIRENS STOP. SHE BEGINS TO
GET ON HER COAT. JERRY AND TODD ENTER RUNNING.)
JERRY: What's happening? Sue, where are you going?
SUE: It's time those aliens were taught a lesson. They can
take over the university and they can conquer the world, but when they start messing around with my phone wires, that's where I draw the tine.
JERRY: You mean you're going out to confront the aliens in
your raincoat?
SUE: Jerry, the aliens aren't in my raincoat. lam.
TODD: (DRAWING HER ASIDE) Listen. Sue, those aliens
probably have ray guns and blasters and lasers and
ohasers and all kinds of dangerous weapons. You're crazy
to go after them. (PAUSE) Send Jerry.
(SHE LOOKS AT HIM IN A CALCULATING WAY FOR A FEW MOMENTS, THEN TURNS BACK TO JERRY WITH A WIDE SMILE.)
SUE: Jerry! How would you like to do a little favour for
me?
JERRY: Anything, Sue! Polish your shoes? Scrub your back?
Scrub your shoes? Polish your back? (BEGINNING TO
SING.) I'd do anything for you. Sue. anything...
SUE: Jerry, shut up.
JERRY: Surely.
SUE: I was wondering if you - and possibly your calculating
friends here - would like to go over to the PRG building and convince those aliens to leave my phone system alone.
THE COMPUTER: Aliens?
ED: But that could be dangerous.
TODD: No, no, not likely, no, yes, a bit. But just because
you'll be walking completely unarmed into a building
swarming with warlike creatures from outer space is no
reason to believe you won't make it out alive. Think of
Obiwan Kenobi in the Death Star.
LEIF: He didn't make it out alive.
TODD: That's the exception that proves the rule, granola
head.
SUE: And remember. Jerry, dear, you'd also be doing Earth a
favour, saving it from those mean old aliens. A girl
couldn't help but lose her heart to a brave hero who was
willing to give his all to protect her home planet.
JERRY: I'll get rid of those aliens. Sue, or die trying.
SUE: It's always nice to look on the bright side, isn't it?
JERRY: Come along, friends, we're off to face the foe!
JERRY AND THE SPACEBREAKERS:

(THEY MARCH OUT SINGING AND WHISTLING.) SUE: Think they'll ever come back. Todd?
TODD: Nahh. Let's go for coffee.
SUE: Just let me get my coat off.
[5-15] (PHONE RINGS.)
Could you get that?
TODD: (ANSWERING PHONE) Brothers and sisters, welcome to
Dial-a-Prayer. Let us bow our heads for a few moments of reverent meditation on the subject of sin. Hello? Hel-

SMEDLEY MERKIN (SMEDLEY)
CL-1] (WE OPEN ON THE SPACESHIP, NEARLY COMPLETE. THERE ARE
SPARE PARTS LYING AROUND NEAR IT. CHESTER AND EDDIE ENTER.
THEY ARE WEARING COVERALLS OF THE TYPE MECHANICS AND
SPACEMEN WEAR.)
CHESTER FIELD: It seems incredible that we've nearly got
this project off the ground. I especially Like the red plastic that we got to cover the hull. It almost makes it look real.., sort of. Where did you get it?
EDDIE MATCH: The fibreglas? It was up at the Bauer
warehouse, all convoluted with holes in it.
(BULLMOOSE STAGGERS ONSTAGE, DRUNK AND WEARING FOOTBALL GEAR.)
CHESTER: What's gotten into him?
EDDIE: He's upset because the Warriors have decided to cut
the entire offensive string of the football team. The
defense was out playing for 997. of the games anyway.
CHESTER: He certainty looks offensive.
EDDIE: I hear that they've gone further than that now. They
actually have a generic football team which plays Ail the games.
CHESTER: A generic football team? Does that mean both
teams wear white sweaters with black stripes?
EDDIE: It's like this: Say Waterloo and U of 1- were sup-
posed to be playing. For the first half of the game the
offense would play for Waterloo and the defense for
Toronto. Then, half-way through, they'd switch.
CHESTER: That seems sporting.
EDDIE: We were even going to merge with Carnegie-Mellon
University until we realized that the football team would be called the Water-Mellons.
(POLLY, SHARON AND LUCY ENTER AS BULLMOOSE EXITS.)
POLLY SYLLABIC: I can't believe that you can be so nice all
the time when you have to attend class with all those
rowdy engineers. Sharon.
SHARON SHARALIKE: They're not that bad. Polly. Most of the
ones that sit near me are Civil. Right now they're
learning about the newest transportation systems. You
know; things like monorails.
POLLY: I always knew engineers had one track minds.
SHARON: Did you know that when joining two cars you mast
achieve critical damping before coupling for resonance?
LUCY DIAMONDSKI: Wow. I knew it. but I didn't realize it
applied to cars too.
SHARON: I just wish the grads would quit making cracks
about my "Sine Curves".
(ROGER AND MONA ARRIVE.)
ROGER WILCO: I'm glad to see everyone's here. Let's put
the finishing touches on the ship and blast off!
MONA NUCLEOSIS: Cy isn't here. (FALLS ASLEEP.)
POLLY: I haven't seen him since the disco the other night.
EDDIE: Maybe he tried to sell them prescription Peer
glasses.
ROGER: Chester boLt the crankshaft to the connecting rods
and make sure the belts are tight!
(CHESTER LOOKS CONFUSED, SHRUGS AND THROWS THE CRANKSHAFT IN THE BACK.)
Mona, wake up and put the space maps in the glove com-
partment.
(MONA CLIMBS INTO THE PILOT SEAT AND FALLS ASLEEP.)
Eddie, go get the two fuel cylinders.., and don't drop
them. That rocket fuel is powerful stuff.
EDDIE: Yeah. I know. We get bombed on it regularly in the
village.
(EDDIE GOES OFF TO GET THE FUEL CYLINDERS. POLLY INSTALLS
THE SIREN ON TOP OF THE SHIP.)
SHARON: What's that?
POLLY: It's our secret weapon, designed to lure the aliens
to death and destruction upon the rocks. A siren.
LUCY: Far Freaking Out! Stoned green men!
CHESTER: But there aren't any stones up there.
LUCY: Mona says they're at the top of the charts.
ROGER: All right gangs is that everything?
SHARON: It should be. It took us long enough to build it.
CHESTER: Well, if someone (GLARES AT SHARON) had thought to
measure the door to the workshop BEFORE we built it the
first time, we wouldn't have had to start over.
ROGER: (ROGER CUTS THIS ARGUMENT SHORT) Who's got the
checklist? Mona? Mona!
MONA: (WAKING:) All in favour?
ROGER: Stop it. Who has the checklist?
MONA: You do.
ROGER: Right. Life Support?
LUCY: We've got Mars Bars, Milky Way bars. Orbit gum. and
Tang.
[S-13 (TANG, TANG, TANG, TANG...)
ROGER: Cut it out! Anchor pins released?
CHESTER: (RELEASING THEM WITH POLLY) Anchor pins released.
ROGER: Check. Rocket fuel?
(EDDIE RETURNS WITH TWO FUEL CANISTERS. ONE IS LABELED "A"
AND THE OTHER "B". HE ATTACHES THEM TO THE SHIP.)
EDDIE: Yep. Fuel "A", and fuel "B". I just got the stuff
from Professor Lactic in the Chem Lab.
ROGER: Check. Electrical Systems?
(MONA SWITCHES ON NAVIGATIONAL LIGHTS -- HEADLIGHTS, PORT & STARBOARD.)
MONA: See how bright they are now? These gerbils run much
faster than the hamsters we had before.
ROGER: Check. Communications?
POLLY: I've got three books on Psychological Interpersonal
Communication. including Games Aliens Play. I also
scored well on the ALP exam last week.
ROGER: ALP exam?
POLLY: Alien Language Proficiency exam.
(JUSTIN. HUGH. STAN, GLADYS ENTER.)
GLADYS FRIDAY: Hi, I'm Gladys Friday!
STAN STILL: Stan Still!
HUGH BETCHA: Hugh Betcha!
JUSTIN THYME: And I'm Justin Thyme.
ROGER: Justin Thyme? Just in time for what?
JUSTIN: To join you on your trip into the glorious charted
depths of known space. To wit, to the alien spacecraft.
HUGH: We need a new place to publish our newspaper.
STAN: That's rights our old place got burned down.
GLADYS: And since we're not allowed to publish the univer-
sity's one true student newspaper QO campus...
HUGH: We thought we'd publish AM:nig campus.
JUSTIN: Having an office up there (POINTS) certainty would
make it easier to distribute copies. Just fold them into
paper airplanes and drop them out the windows.
GLADYS: Yeah. I've been practising my paper airplanes at
Fed Flicks every weekend!
STAN: Maybe we could drop you out the window too.
ROGER: I'm sorry, but we can't take any of you along. We
don't have room.
STAN: But we heard at the disco that you needed volunteers.
ROGER: Volunteers, yes. but I'm not running an office
relocation service.
JUSTIN: Is that so? (SWITCH INTO RADICAL MODE) We'll go to
jail for what we believe! We shall denounce you as im- perialist space-mongers who seek to oppress free opinion! We shall crush you! You've not heard the last from us.
Mr.Flying Dog Lackey!
(THE JOURNALISTS LEAVE.)
MONA: How can they publish a newspaper? There's a paper
shortage! We had to whisper our answers for the final
exam to the prof as he walked down the aisle.
CHESTER: You think that's bad. We were only given one exam
paper and the whole row had to work on it!
EDDIE: That's nothing new. We've always written our exams
that way.
ROGER: Where were we before we were interrupted?
CHESTER: (FIRMLY) We'd finished the checklist.
ROGER: (BUCKLING ON HELMET) Great! That means it's time to
face the unknown. Who has the keys?
MONA: You do.
ROGER: No I don't. Who had them last?
CHESTER: Eddie.
EDDIE: Polly.
POLLY: Sharon.
SHARON: Lucy.
LUCY: Mona.
MONA: Lucy.
LUCY: Sharon.
SHARON: Polly.
POLLY: Eddie.
EDDIE: Chester.
CHESTER: You did.
ROGER: I guess we'll have to go and took for them. We'll
meet back here in half a parsec. Mona, you stay here and
guard the ship.
MONA: Okay.
ROGER: And don't fall asleep.
MONA: I wouldn't dream of it.
(ALL BUT MONA LEAVE. SHE GETS IN PILOT'S SEAT AND FALLS
ASLEEP. THE JOURNALISTS RE-ENTER WITH BILL E.CLUB.)
JUSTIN: There it is! You know what you have to do.
BILL E. CLUB: (EYES LIGHT UP) Ho-Lee! Youse fellers
weren't joshing. I haven't had a chance to do this in
years. (ON RADIO:) Security Control, this is officer
Bill E. Club; we've got us an illegally parked... uh...
What is that thing. boy?
GLADYS: It's a spaceship.
BILL E.: Do tell. Well. I don't much care what you wanna
call it, we're gonna tow it. (TO RADIO:) Control; we got
us an illegally parked ve-hicle here.
STAN: This'll fix them.
BILL E.: (STILL INTO RADIO:) Well. hells I don't know which
company to call; call both of them.
HUGH: I guess Security hasn't towed many cars since the
ring road was bought by Barnum and Bailey.
BILL E.: Roger. (PAUSE) I know that's not your name, Dave.
Over and out.
JUSTIN: We haven't done anything this nasty since we in-
vented disco.
(THE JOURNALISTS AND SECURITY LEAVE. BULLMOOSE HARRISON
ENTERS, STILL TIPSY. DURING THE FOLLOWING EXCHANGES HE
MANAGES TO OPEN EACH FUEL CYLINDER AND DRINK THE CONTENTS. SMEDLEY MERKIN COMES IN SLOWLY.)
SMEDLEY MERKIN: Hailey! Halley Phillips! Bullmoose, have
you seen Hailey Phillips? She was supposed to meet me
after class.
BULLMOOSE HARRISON: Don't bother me. never play foot-
ball again.
SMEDLEY: Don't tell me you've been traded to the Argos!
BULLMOOSE: Nah. The coach replaced the team's entire front
line with the biggest, hairiest gorilla of a football
player I've ever seen. The stupid ape kicked the ball
right over the fence around Seagram Stadium.
SMEDLEY: That's a pretty good kick!
BULLMOOSE: Sure was. We were playing in Halifax. We Lost
283 balls that game. The dumb monkey kept eating tnem.
(OFFERS ROCKET FUEL:) Want some?
SMEDLEY: No thanks. I only drink unleaded. Besides. 1 nave
to find HaiLey. She said she's cracked the formula for
Milk of Amnesia and she even thinks she knows what my
super-power is. Here I go to save the day!
(SMEDLEY DASHES FOR THE EXIT. HIS CAPE IS CAUGHT UNDER
BULLMOOSE'S FEET, AND IT RIPS OFF AS MUCH COSTUME AS WE CAN
MANAGE.)
BULLMOOSE: (PICKING UP COSTUME:) This must be why Batman
never used Velcro.
MONA: (WAKES AND LOOKS AT HER WATCH:) Ah, perfect timing.
They should be back any minute.
(MONA CLIMBS OUT OF THE SPACESHIP, AND BULLMOOSE CLIMBS IN. THE INTREPID ASTROS RETURN.)
ROGER: I'm sorry, we can't waste any more time looking for
those keys. We'll have to hotwire it. (HE OPENS A PANEL
IN THE SHIP.) Get me a screwdriver out of the tool box.
SHARON: (AFTER TRYING TOOL BOX LID) It's locked.
CHESTER: Oh. I've got that. (HE BEGINS TO THUMB THROUGH
KEYS.) Car key, church key# alien executive washroom key, spaceship ignition key key of F# minor...
(HE SUDDENLY REALIZES WHAT HE HAS SAID. HE COWERS WHILE
ROGER APPROACHES HIM.)
ROGER: (WITH ICE:) Thank you ever so much. Chester.
Everyone into the ship.
(AIA PILE INTO THE SPACESHIP.) Let's go!
MONA: What heading. Roger?
ROGER: (POINTING A LA JAMES T. KIRK:) Oh. Up there...
that away
(BY THIS TIME THEY ARE ALL IN. THERE IS AN ATTEMPTED TAKE-
OFF.)
ES-27 (SOUND OF AN AIRPLANE ATTEMPTING TO TAKE-OFF,
UNSUCCESSFULLY. THIS SOUND QUICKLY DIES OUT AND STOPS.)
POLLY: (POKES HER HEAD OUT THE DOOR) What's the matter?
Can't you get it up?
ROGER: Shut-up. There's something wrong. Everybody out un-
til we identify the problem.
(EVERYONE FILES OUT.)
EDDIE: It's probably those darn gerbil pumps again!
(SHARON EMERGES FROM THE BACK WITH THE GERBIL CAGE. IT IS
SMOKING.)
SHARON: I think we've got a short. Are these six volt or
twelve volt gerbils?
CHESTER: I believe they're six volt. Positive ground.
ROGER: Ground, hells they're deep-fried.
EDDIE: We can replace the gerbils. (LOOKS INTO ONE FUEL
TANK:) But we have a bigger problem. There's no fuel
Left in this tank!
ROGER: No fuel? But it was full when you brought it out
here!
(BULLMOOSE HICCUPS LOUDLY. ALL STARE.)
EDDIE: Bullmoose drank half the fuel!
(BULLMOOSE HICCUPS AGAIN.)
CHESTER: If he drank the stuff in the other tank too we're
in big trouble. Without the gerbil pumps to control the
mixing of the two fuels, he could explode with enough
force to blow us all to Fergus!
(EDDIE RUNS TO CHECK THE OTHER TANK.)
POLLY: Bullmoose, you didn't drink BOTH tanks, did you?
BULLMOOSE: Welt. I was kind of thirsty...
EDDIE: Oh. no! This tank is empty too!
LUCY: Call the bombed squad!
POLLY: I move we abandon ship!
EDDIE: Second it!
MONA: All in favour?
ALL: Aye!
ROGER: Carried! Let's get out of here!
(THEY ALL RUSH OUT IN DIFFERENT DIRCTIONS. BULLMOOSE REMAINS IN THE SPACESHIP AND DECIDES TO STAY STILL. ENTER HYPERACTIVE TOWING.)
HYPERACTIVE TOWING: Yep. This must be the ve-hicle I'm
supposed to tow.
BULLMOOSE: Wait! You're not going to tow this, are you?
HYPERACTIVE: Yep. I'm a bona fide employee of HyperActive
Towing; we can tow anything. Just last week. I had to
tow Health Services for being illegally parked on Laurel
Creek.
BULLMOOSE: But if you move me. I'll explode!
HYPERACTIVE: Hey, that's a good one! I haven't heard that
good an excuse since some guy called Burt tried to make me believe he ran this place. (MEANINGFULLY) But I towed him anyway.
(HE PROCEEDS TO ATTACH HIS TOW ROPE ONTO THE SHIP. ENTER
RETROACTIVE TOWING WHO DOES THE SAME ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE VEHICLE.)
BULLMOOSE: What are ygu doing?
RETROACTIVE TOWING: Whenever HyperActive Towing tows
something away we tow it back. We're RetroActive Towing. I just figured that I'd save time time by towing your car back before they towed it away.
BULLMOOSE: Oh. no!
(TOWING PROCEED TO GET ON THEIR TOW-TRIKES.) No! No! I don't want to die! Please stop! RETROACTIVE: What's with him. Fred?
HYPERACTIVE: Oh he gave me some weird story about how
he'll explode if we move the vehicle.
RETROACTIVE: That's rich.
BULLMOOSE: I've got a belly full of Type "A" and Type "B"
rocket fuel! You move me. and I'LL blow up!
HYPERACTIVE: Sons when we decide we're going to tow, we
tow. We don't listen to any number of arguments, whether
complex, real or imaginary. All right Joe, let's go.
(THEY BEGIN TO PULL. BULLMOOSE BEGINS TO PRAY. THEY MANAGE TO PULL THE CRAFT APART AND BULLMOOSE EXPLODES. THE SHIP IS IN TWO PIECES ON THE FLOOR AND BULLMOOSE IS GONE. ROGER AND THE OTHERS ALL RETURN.)
ROGER: What happened? What have you done to the spaceship?
CHESTER: Now we'll never be able to save the campus!
HYPERACTIVE: (STILL STUNNED) That guy must have been
telling the truth.
RETROACTIVE: That's what you get for mixing your drinks.
LUCY: Oh, hey, it must have been like an Act of God.
HYPERACTIVE: (SOMBRE:) No. ma'am. (WITH FEELING:) It's
just an Act of Towing.

IONA CHEVY-PICKUP: But what do we care about the sex Life

JILL BAIT: How are we going to do that?
BJORN TOBEW1LD: As a Co-op Burglar I have been entertaining
a number of interesting ideas on that subject. (PRODUCES
A CASSETTE TAPE RECORDER:) My theory is that the lock is
operated by a complex set of phonemes with varying tonal
qualities arranged in a specific order.
OLIVIA NEWTON-FIG: (POINTING TO KEY) But why not just try
that key?

ED: What a coincidence running into you like this. Hailey.
You haven't seen any aliens down here Lately, have you?
HAILEY PHILLIPS: (TO ED:) Mm-um-mmph-um.
JERRY: What did she say?
ED: She said, "mm-um-mmph-um."
(HAILEY MANAGES TO KICK HIM IN THE ANKLE.)
BJORN: Here, let me talk to her. What happened, Halley?
HAILEY: Mmmph.
OLIVIA: What'd she say?
BJORN: She says that four aliens named Sophocles,
Aristophanes, Euripides. and Absurdities kidnapped her at the disco and tried to get her to reveal the formula for the Milk of Amnesia by drugging her with catnip.
OLIVIA: She chooses her words well..
LEIF: But that's silly; Hailey doesn't have the formula
anymore. We do.
HAILEY: Mm-pph-nn.
LEIF: Don't you remember. Haitey? For safe keeping you
stored the formula in our co-op computer.
HAILEY: Nnn-mm-ph.
LEIF: Yes you did. We can get it for you any time you
want.
HAILEY: Nnn-mpph-mm.
LEIF: Are you worried we might give it to the aliens? We'd
never do that.
(ALIENS APPEAR.)
SOPHOCLES: Would you care to put a little money on tnat.
Earthling?
(THE DOORS AROUND HAILEY OPEN TO REVEAL THE ALIENS WITH WEAPONS DRAWN. THE STAGE LIGHTS UP FULLY WHILE THE JEAN PROJECTORS DIM AND THE FOLLOW SPOT FADES.)

ARISTOPHANES: So. You have infiltrated our stronghold. How
did you ever do it?
JERRY: Tunnel vision.
ARISTOPHANES: No matter: You shall never leave now that we
have you in our grasp!
SOPHOCLES: Absurdities, bring out that other Earthling.
(THE MISSING CY NUSITIS IS PRODUCED.)
CV NUSITIS: Lemme go! I'm allergic to cat fur, you know!
SOPHOCLES: You see. your University administration brought
this Earthling here to use as a guinea hen.
EURIPIDES: Pig.
SOPHOCLES: Guinea pig. They plan to use the Milk of Am-
nesia to make the students forget their entire. expen-
sive. University education. Even your own kind has
turned against you. Give us that formula!
JILL: We won't let you take over the university for your
fiendish ends.

JERRY: Look, this is silty. Why can't we just discuss this
like two reasonable human beings?
(SOPHOCLES ADJUSTS HIS ANTENNAE.) Let me re-- phrase that...
(HAILEY, WHO HAS BY THIS TIME BEEN UNGAGGED, INTERRUPTS JERRY.)
HAILEY: Jerry, come here. I overheard the aliens talking
earlier, and it seems they're all compulsive gamoiers.
Why not just make them a little offer they can't refuse?
JERRY: It's worth a try. All right, you cats. i don't
suppose you'd be interested in making a tittle waer?
SOPHOCLES: Wager? Is that anything like a bet?
EURIPIDES: Bet? Did you say "BET"?
JERRY: Well, actually I said "wager." but it's the same
idea.
(ALIENS START MUTTERING THINGS LIKE "BET?", "YEAH, dET".
"WHAT'S THIS ABOUT A BET?", ETC.)
ABSURDITIES: What did you have in mind?
JERRY: A little competition. Best two out of three.
ARISTOPHANES: Best two out of three what?
JERRY: We'll decide the games later.
EURIPIDES: And what are the stakes?
JERRY: Simple. If you win we'll give you the formula for
the Milk of Amnesia that's stored in the computer. 3ut
if we win you aliens will have to leave earth and never
darken our solar system again.
SOPHOCLES: Let me get this straight. Right now we have you
people completely at our mercy. In a few hours we could
torture that formula out of you with all our fancy alien
torture equipment. And you're suggesting we forget this
sure thing, set you all free, and take you on in a
contest where we stand to lose not only the formula but
all earth as well? (PAUSE) Sounds good to me.
ARISTOPHANES: Yeah, I think it's all right.
JERRY: It's a deal!

MICROPHONE IS LOWERED FROM ROOF ON A STRING. HOWARD COSINE ENTERS AND GRABS IT.)
HOWARD COSINE: (A LA COSELL:) Ladies and gentlemen. welcome
to the first ever, last ever annual inter-planetary games to decide the fate of the universe. In the black corner, weighing ninety-eight pounds apiece are the champions of earth, the underdogs, the co-operative cream of col- legiate calisthenics. Jerry and the Space-breakers!

CAT-CALLS. LOTTA LUST, THE CHEERLEADER, ENTERS
ACROBATICALLY.)
LOTTA LUST: (LEADING THE CHEER)
Let's hear it for the humans, one, two. three. There's more than one way to skin a cat. There's more than one way to hang a rat, There's only one team that rules O.K.
And earth is on that team today.
Yeah. earth!

ROMAN UMPIRE: Now folks. I want a clean fight, no biting,

belt, hitting above the belt. Vulcan neck-pinching, or
any of that stuff. This contest is going to run smoothly
and fairly according to the intergalactic principles of
fair play and the rules set out by the Marquis de Sade.
IONA CHEVY-PICKUP: What does that mean?
UMPIRE: The side that gets whipped. gets whipped.
IONA: Uh-oh.
JERRY OTZOVDAGODS: Don't worry. Iona, we can beat these
cats at any contest they name.
EURIPIDES: You think so, do you?
SOPHOCLES: You Earthlings couldn't win a game of
solitaire.., even if you cheated.
ED CHEESE: I would never think of cheating.
OLIVIA NEWTON-FIG: That's why you're stilt in 2A.
PETER OUT: Every year the profs get together to discuss 2B
or not 2B, but they haven't passed him yet.
ARISTOPHANES: And even though you can't beat the system,
you think you can beat us?
WENDY KOWZCUMHOME: I bet we can.
ALIENS: BET? Did you say BET?
UMPIRE: Will you guys settle down?
SOPHOCLES: Your pardon, glorious referee. We were simply
carried away with momentary enthusiasm.
LEIF LETTUCE: They should be carried away with butterfly
nets.
SOPHOCLES: Laugh now, human, but soon you will be laughing
out of the other side of your face.
ABSURDITIES: I thought the only place they could do that
was Alpha Centauri.
SOPHOCLES: Thanks d heap. Absurdities, you just trivialized
my best taunt.
UMPIRE: Will you people quit squabbling and decide what
sort of competition we're going to have here?
BJORN TOBEWILD: How about frisbees?
EURIPIDES: Flying saucers are our specialty.
JILL BAIT: We might stand a better chance at marbles.
ARISTOPHANES: If you hadn't lost yours already.
JERRY: How about a three-legged race?
SOPHOCLES: Great. Felix, could you come in here?
(FELIX RUNS ON QUICKLY. SHE HAS THREE LEGS.)
JERRY: Get her out of here. That's not a cat.
SOPHOCLES: Of course she is - she's a Siamese. The knife
just slipped when they were separating her from her
sister.
JERRY: I still don't call her a cat. Out with her.
FELIX: (EXITING SADLY) Tabby or not Tabby, that is the

SOPHOCLES: Wells would you prefer horseshoes?
OLIVIA: Too hard to get them off the horse.
ABSURDITIES: Red Rover?
IONA: None of us can pronounce your alien names.
EURIPIDES: A drag race?
ED: Sorry, we left our dresses in EngSoc.
UMPIRE: Enough arguing. We'll run the three standard
contests always used in deciding the fate of the
universe.
ALL: Oh, all right.
UMPIRE: The first contest is a tug of war. Choose up your
teams.
(THE EARTHLINGS BEGIN DOING ONE POTATO, TWO POTATO, ETC.
THE ALIENS HUDDLE.)
ABSURDITIES: This could be tough. boss. Do you think we're
stronger than the humans?
SOPHOCLES: If we are stronger, it's only because we don't
have the Milk of Amnesia to unclog our shower drains.
EURIPIDES: You mean we could lose?
SOPHOCLES: We wiil lose if we just keep pussy-footing
around here. Aristophanes, go tie this rope to the
spaceship.
ARISTOPHANES: Right. boss.
(HE EXITS WITH ONE END OF THE ROPE.) UMPIRE: Is everybody ready?
JERRY: I want to know where the water is.
UMPIRE: What water?
JERRY: Tugs of war are always across a creek. That way the
losing team ends up in the water, and then in Health Ser- vices for tetanus shots.
UMPIRE: Will you just take your positions?
LEIF: I didn't bring my Kama Sutra.
WENDY: Shut up and get ready to pull.

UMPIRE: (BLOWING WHISTLE) All right, the first contest goes
to the Bonzo Cat team, making the score Aliens one,
humans nothing.
JERRY: Never mind, team, we'll win the second contest. (TO
UMP) What do we play next?
UMPIRE: For the next contest, both teams will draw three
words out of a hat, and will have thirty seconds in which to use those three words in a song of their own creation.
PETER: What kind of stupid contest is that?
UMPIRE: Music is known as the international language. What
fairer contest could there be?
EURIPIDES: Does that make sense to you?
JILL: Not a bit.
UMPIRE: Tough. The aliens go first,
(HOWARD BRINGS HIM A HAT FILLED WITH SLIPS OF PAPER.) Draw.
ARISTOPHANES: (DRAWING) All right, I've got them.
UMPIRE: The words the aliens have to make into a song are

Sex and drugs and downhill skis, Enough to last for thirty years. Sex and drugs and downhill skis,
And now and then some beer.
I did not come here to fill my head with knowledge, But to flush it out through excess alcoholage. After which I'LL need a mental overhaul, a j-

UMPIRE: And now to judge those two mediocre efforts, could
we bring in the applause meter, please.

There you have it, folks, the humans win by a landslide. JERRY: Hey, that makes it one-all.
JILL: That's the best we can expect. Let's go home.
SOPHOCLES: Not so fast. Earthling, there's stilt one more
contest.
JILL: Oh, all right. What do we do this time?
UMPIRE: This time we hold a boat race.
ED: I hate to tett you this, but the creek dried up long
ago.
UMPIRE: Not a boat race, a boat race.
ED: Oh, a boat race! Why didn't you say so?
EURIPIDES: Master, do we really want to conquer this
planet?
UMPIRE: Choose your teams. Each side needs four men...
persons.., things.., to drink in succession. Bring out
the beer glasses.
(THE GLASSES ARE BROUGHT OUT BY THE BANANA 3UNCHERS. THOUGH
THE GLASSES ARE OBVIOUSLY EMPTY, EVERYONE TAKES ONE AND GETS READY TO DRINK.)
On your marks. Get set. Go!
(NOTHING HAPPENS.)
What's wrong?
OLIVIA: There isn't any beer.
UMPIRE: What happened to it?
OLIVIA: Maybe it got drafted.
JILL: Well hey, if there's no beer for the boat race. I
guess we can alt go home.
ED: Second it.
PETER: All in favour?
JERRY: Hey! You guys can't do that
ED: Sorry.
ABSURDITIES: Ref, isn't there some kind of back-up for this
kind of emergency?
UMPIRE: Well, the only other thing we've got on the props
table is bananas.
ALL: Bananas?
JERRY: We can't boat race with bananas.
UMPIRE: I think bananas have appeal.
ARISTOPHANES: If you cop out on this, we win by default.
PETER: Come on. Jerry, boat-racing with bananas should be
easy.
OLIVIA: And it's either go through with this, or we have to
give up the formula for the Milk of Amnesia.
JERRY: We'll never do that.
EURIPIDES: You will if we win. That was the deal.
JERRY: We'Le going to win. ALL right, bring on the
bananas; I can take on the bunch myself.

ABSURDITIES: Pardon?
UMPIRE: On your marks. Get set. Go!
ABSURDITIES: Pardon?
(THE CONTEST BEGINS. THE HUMANS DO THEIR BEST TO PEEL THE
BANANAS ONE AT A TIME AND EAT THEM, BUT THE ALIENS JUST STUFF THE BANANAS DOWN THEIR SHIRTS.)
ED: I hate to mention this. but I'm allergic to bananas.
JERRY: Just eat. If you break out in hives, we'll hetp you
scratch.
SOPHOCLES: Allergic. eh? You humans might as welt throw in
the towel.
ED: Towel? Yeah, that would be a lot better: living in the
Village. I'm used to eating chopped towel.
JILL: Hey the aliens aren't eating they're just shoving
the bananas down their shirts.
EURIPIDES: I take it you don't understand the Bonzo Cat
digestive system.
ABSURDITIES: Pardon?
SOPHOCLES: Absurdities, quick, eat your banana and we've
won.
ABSURDITIES: Pardon?
SOPHOCLES: Absurdities, you've got your banana in your ear!
ABSURDITIES: I'm sorry. I can't hear you. I've got my
banana in my ear.
JERRY: Quick, team, we're almost finished.
(SOPHOCLES YANKS THE BANANA OUT OF ABSURDITIES' EAR AND
SHOVES IT DOWN HIS SHIRT.)
SOPHOCLES: We're finished, we win!
(THE CATS MEOW.)
UMPIRE: Sophocles is right. The aliens have won two out of
the three contests and are now entitled to the formula
for Milk of Amnesia.
HUMANS: Boo!
HOWARD: So there you have it. The contest is over. The
human race is doomed because a team of co-op students couldn't find it in themselves to come out on top. Whatever hard work and training they've put in has gone to wastes and the only future foreseeable for the earth team is one of regret and misery because they have failed their planet. Losers, each and every One of them...
JERRY: Will you dry up!
HOWARD: Surely.
SOPHOCLES: Rights all we want is the formula for the milk
so we can get our invasion on the move.
PETER: Okay. Memory, get the formula for the Milk of Am-
nesia.
JILL: (REACHING INTO HER POCKET AND TAKING OUT A PIECE OF
PAPER) Right.
PETER: Send it to the printer.
OLIVIA: (TAKING THE PAPER FROM JILL) Thanks. Jill.
(OLIVIA BEGINS TO COPY OUT JILL'S PAPER ON ANOTHER SHEET.)
SOPHOCLES: Fellow aliens from the glorious planet Bonzo
Cat...
(THE USUAL MEOWS.)
thank you. This is an auspicious moment. Soon we
will have the precious formula, soon we will return to
our spaceship and soon we will begin mass-production of
the long-awaited solution to our problem. Today we begin cleaning up our drains; and tomorrow, we will clean up... THE WORLD!

clean.
SOPHOCLES: Alas, our saliva glands are not so well

CHARLIE: Just what this world needs, a bunch of oversize

SOP:The crane-hailed plane then finds the train. ALL:With the grain the plane obtained.
ALL:The train collects the grain dropped from the plane. M&F:The plane-dropped grain rains on the train.
ALL:And takes the grain contained across the plain. A&A:The rain train grain across the plain.
EUR:Whilst winnowing week-old wheat whisky will wesult. ABS:We use the booze to make us snooze.
SOP:So telt me plain, where goes the train's grain? EUR:It is drained from the train
ARI:To comfort pain so cats won't wane;
ABS:If they abstain they are insane.
SOP:Explain the chain!
ALL:The maned Dane's stained drain pane rain makes crane pain.
Main rain wets brain, profane lane cane. The trained plain grain train drains
the grain contained!

SOPHOCLES: Have you all got two left feet?
(FELIX PROFFERS THIRD LEG.)
Can't you do anything right?
(THE THREE CATS GESTURE FRANTICALLY AT THE ARMED HORDE
BACKSTAGE.)
What is it? Speak up, are you all dumb animals?
JERRY OTSOVDAGODS: Perhaps the cat's got their tongues.
SOPHOCLES: (TURNS QUICKLY:) Jerry and the Spacebreakers!
(THE HUMANS SPREAD QUICKLY AROUND THE STAGE, AND HOLD THE ALIENS AT SWORD-POINT.)
JERRY: All right. cats. This is where you meet your Water-
loo. Hand back that stack of paper.
SOPHOCLES: You can't back out of our agreement now. We won
the rights to that formula fair 'n' square.
JERRY: The rights to the formula. yes. But you haven't
paid for the stack of computer paper it's printed on!
SOPHOCLES: Haven't paid for the paper it's printed on?
Where did you dig up a crazy idea like that?
11: 124 What Goes Up, Must Come Down Page
JILL BAIT: I think some Merchant in Venice used it about
1400 A.D.
ABSURDITIES: Master! These Earthlings are a lot older than
they took!
SOPHOCLES: The Earthlings wish to play with swords; well,
we have a swordsman too! Damocles; seize them!

her little flashing lights.
LOIS BIDDER: Smedley? Smedley? Where are you Smedley?
They've kidnapped Smedley!
(LOIS SHRIEKS AS SMEDLEY MOVES CLOSE TO HER.) Oh! Smedley!
SHARON SHARALIKE: Where have all the aliens gone?
PETER OUT: I don't hear anything.
HAILEY PHILLIPS: Someone just took my sword!
JERRY: And mine too!
SMEDLEY MERKIN: We've all been disarmed!
SOPHOCLES: Cats, draw your light sabres.
(ALIENS. SURROUNDING THE HUMANS, DRAW LIGHT SABRES WHICH
GLOW UNDER BLACK LIGHT.)
JERRY: I smell Kitty Litter.
SOPHOCLES: Too bad your sense of smell is better than your
eyesight,
JERRY: Gang! Behind us!
SMEDLEY: Which way is behind?
SOPHOCLES: Lights, Aristophanes. These humans don't see as
well in the dark as we cat-men do.
EL-47 (LIGHTS COME BACK ON.)
HAILEY: Smedley! You're our only hope! Use your super-
power to save us!
SMEDLEY: But I don't know what it is!
HAILEY: I do, but there's no time to explain. Smedley,
kiss me.
SMEDLEY: Hailey, you're fogging my glasses again.
HAILEY: For goodness sakes take them off. Smedley.
SMEDLEY: Hailey. I've been meaning to tell you; I belong to
someone else...
HAILEY: Smedley. I don't care if you're rented from U-Haul!
Kiss me!
(SMEDLEY IS DRAGGED INTO HAILEY'S EMBRACE.) LOIS: Smedley!
HAILEY: It didn't work. But, that was supposed to
stimulate Smedley's super-power.
LOIS: Well, if it's stimulation he needs, stand aside.
CS - 3] (LOIS LEAPS ON TOP OF SMEDLEY AND KISSES HIM. THIS
KISS WORKS. SOUND OF WEDDING BELLS, SIREN, BIG BEN, AND
FINALLY DRAINS GURGLING.)
ED: That gurgling noise!
SOPHOCLES: A free-running drain! Showers! Cats; to the
spaceship!
(FELINE STAMPEDE TO THE TRANSPORTER.)
HAILEY: See! That tab accident created two super drain
cleaners. the Milk of Amnesia. and Smedley.
SOPHOCLES: (FROM MOUTH OF BOUNCE TUBE.) You win a temporary
reprieve. Earthlings. But, mark my words, we'll be back
sooner than you think.
CS-43 (TRANSPORTER SPRING NOISE AS ALIENS DEPART.) PETER: We're saved!
ALL: Three cheers for Smedley!
(NO ONE DOES ANY CHEERING.)
SHARON: But what are we going to do when the aliens finish
showering?
JERRY: That won't be for a while yet. They've got 8JU
tanks full of dwarves and frogs out there to clean. I
don't think we'll be seeing much of those aliens for a
long, long. time.
LOIS: Oh, Smedley. I'm sorry I doubted you. You really do
have a wonderful super-power.
CHARLIE: Yeah. He'll make some man a wonderful wife.
SMEDLEY: Yes Lois, it looks as though I've finally achieved
my lifelong ambition to be a super hero.

BILL E.CLUB: Stop that singing.
SINGERS: Surely.
OLIVIA: Officer 9i11 E.Club!
BILL E.: Which one of you fellers owns that thing parked
over this here heating plant?
PETER: None of us do.
CHARLIE: Let's just say that it belongs to some crazy cats
who are just out-of-this-world.
BILL E. I tell you, there've been some mighty strange
things going on around here. That big hairy deal at the disco, that exploding ve-hicle, the football team winning a game. And now... Fred, bring in what you found, will you.

HYPERACTIVE TOWING: I found these people tied up in this
rope, hanging off the end of that thing up there.
(POINTS UP)
JILL: It's Wendy and her little flashing tights!
ED: And the rest of our computer!
CHARLIE: I knew someone around here was only working with
half a DEC.
JILL: We thought you'd all had the 'Bun.
JERRY: Officer Bilt E.Club, these people lost the tug-of-
war with the alien cats from outer space when we could sing better and also ate bananas because the beer had been drafted but they lost before we won the applause meter and Ed was allergic to them when they stuffed them down their shirts and got away with the Milk.
BILL E.: And you expect me to believe that?
JERRY: No. I expected you to say "pardon?".
BILL E.: Now, I don't know which one of you wants to admit
to owning that flying saucers but it was in contravention of the University parking regulations and it'll cost you $100 in towing charges to get it back.
(HYPERACTIVE TOWING ATTACHES THE HOOK TO BILL E.)
OLIVIA: Security towed away the Bonzo Cats' flying saucer!
JERRY: Please tell me I didn't hear that.
HYPERACTIVE: It's a fact. We're Hyperactive Towing, and we
tow anything.
(HYPERACTIVE HOPS ON HIS TRIKE AND TOWS BILL E. AROUND THE STAGE, SINGING:)
We tow anything, for you, tow anything.... BILL E.: Fred, stop singing.
HYPERACTIVE: Surely.
JERRY: (TO OTHERS:) You know what all this means?
SMEDLEY: It means a rather large litter of very dirty and
exceptionally high-strung cats just transported them-
selves straight up into a flying saucer that wasn't
there.

(ENTER SUE ZAFONE, CARRYING A PIZZA.) SUE ZAFONE: Stop singing.
SINGERS: Surely.
JERRY: Sue, what are you doing...
SUE: Anyone here order pizza?
SOPHOCLES: Pizza? No one ordered pizza here. Earthling.
SUE: You mean to say I went to the trouble of sneaking past
those fifty thousand hungry dogs outside and no one wants this pizza?
ABSURDITIES: What kind is it?
SUE: Banana Cream. (SHE CHECKS THE BILL:) With anchovies.
It's our convocation special. We bake it at twelve
hundred degrees.
EURIPIDES: What was that about fifty thousand hungry dogs
outside?
SUE; Yeah, there's a whole pack of mongrels getting ready
to charge in here. Listen, can't you hear them?
CS-63 (SUDDENLY WE HEAR A LOUD BARKING AND BAYING.) ABSURDITIES: Dogs? I'm getting out of here.
ARISTOPHANES: Every cat for himself!

everything, to you. Sue. everything...
SUE: Jerry?

WENDY KOWZCUMHOME: Boy Sue, it's a good thing you changed
your mind about coming after the aliens.
SUE: Someone had to clear up my switchboard, and it was
pretty obvious you and Jerry weren't getting anywhere.
LOIS: But where did you get the fifty thousand hungry dogs?
(TODD ENTERS WITH CASSETTE TAPE RECORDER.)
TODD HOTTY: Hertz Rent-a-Beagle.
CS-8] (TODD PUSHES THE BUTTON FOR A BRIEF BURST OF BARKING.)
SMEDLEY: Well, it doesn't matter how you did it, you're the
real heroes.
TODD: Of course. What I don't understand is, if those
aliens wanted the Milk of Amnesia so badly why didn't
you just sell it to them, on the condition they'd leave
Earth alone?
BJORN TOBEWILD: I guess we didn't think of it.
TODD: You really are a bunch of half-wits. The aliens
would have paid billions for that formula.
IONA CHEVY-PICKUP: We could have ended the University's
financial problems forever.
LEIF LETTUCE: You don't suppose we could still sell it to
them, do you?
TODD: Not a chance. Who else would want that Milk oesides
those Bozos from Bonzo Cat?
