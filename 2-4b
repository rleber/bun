  Topping tonight''s Eyewitness news,

  fire broke out in Tonawanda tonight as a full scale nuclear strike

  was accidentally ordered on the town.  Damage was estimated at

  close to twenty-seven dollars and 32 cents.

  Now, here''s Tom, with the weather outside.

  .ch tj

  Thanks very much, Irv.

  Well, that nuclear strike is causing some pretty heavy weather today.

  Winds are expected to reach up to 700 miles an hour.

  The temperature is currently 7000 degrees

  (that''s 3,871 degrees centigrade for you Canadian viewers) with barometric

  pressure rising to 400 inches of mercury.  The National Weather Service

  has issued a ''Fallout Advisory'' for the Niagara Falls area, so you''d

  better get the kids bundled up in lead lined underwear, mom.

  The mayor has already asked the city of Toronto to loan

  us some of their ash removal equipment, so the streets should be safe

  in just a few years.

  Our Accu-Weather forcast predicts clearing tomorrow, with a few mushroom

  clouds hovering over the area.  Not a good day for shopping, as there

  are bound to be occasional fire-storms in local areas.

  Now back to you Irv.

  .ch ew

  Thanks Tom.  In sport today, most local teams were blown up in the

  attack, so there''s very little to report.  That''s all for today.

  Good Night, and I hope you have a tomorrow.
