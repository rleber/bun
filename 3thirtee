  true page to take to\nthe winkle to get a ring modulator.\n\n.aa JJ\nWell, you'd
  better hurry.  It looks like\nyou've got a big day ahead of you!\n\n.le\nWe decided

  change.\n(TO LEFTY) Let's get back to the Winkle. (COMMUNICATOR) Mr. Spot.\nWe have
  a ring modulator. Please notify the others to meet usa at the\nWinkle's palace.\n\n(HUARYU
