:content: ! ".so fass/fasshole\n.he 'FASS'- % -'ACT I SCENE X'\n.FO 'ACT I SCENE X''FASS'\nAct
  1, Scene 10 - Rendezvous\n\n.je\nI assure you that your sister - she is your\nsister
  isn't she? - will be perfectly all right.\nDoctor Macintosh went to the finest medical
  school\nin all the Galaxy and came out with at least a\nB average in most of his
  courses.  I think that's\nwhat he said; either that or he started out as a\nswordsman
  and decided to take a stab at brain surgery,\nI forget which.\nBut enough of all
  this, what about you?\n\n.pd\nWhat would you like to know Captain?\n\n.je\nWell,
  just tell me about Booby and the people on\nit.  We know that it is rich in silicon
  deposits -\nthe hills are just full of the stuff - but beyond\nthat, Booby has kept
  itself pretty well to its own,\nand the Pederasty hasn't really butted in like they\ndo
  on most planets.  Oops.\n\n.pd\nWe have been briefed on your Pederasty, both here\nand
  at home.  We have been briefed on a great \nnumber of things, Captain Jerk.\n\n.je\nSuch
  as?\n\n.pd\nOur chief advisor, the honoured Booby Begonia...\n\n.je\nThat name strikes
  a familiar note.\n\n.pd\n...has warned us that you will try to sweep us off\nour
  feet with your masculine charm, and woo\nthe silicon out of us at a completely unreasonable\nprice.\n\n(JERK
  REMOVES THE ARM THAT HE WAS JUST IN\nTHE ACT OF PUTTING ABOUT HER WAIST.)   \n\nShe
  told us that\nthe Pederasty was not above that sort of thing.\n\n.je\nYour chief
  advisor is a woman?\n\n.pd\nMost of the people in power are women on Booby.\nMen
  are such flighty things after all, their\nminds more often tending towards matters
  of\nromance and pie in the sky - or elsewhere.\nFew can keep their minds on business\nlong
  enough to come to a bargain or negotiate a\nsettlement.  Their minds wander no further
  than\ntheir hands in most cases.\n\n.je\nIndeed.  In the dark past of the Pederasty,
  particularly my planet\nEarth, the same thoughts were held, except\nthat the men
  were in power and the women were thought\nof as brainless noodleheads who were not
  fit to\nbe in command, and were not even capable of\nperforming even the simplest
  tasks on their own.\nJust a minute and I'll  hold the door open\nfor you there -
  these are my quarters.\n\n.pd\nYour quarters, Captain?\n\n.je\nI thought that we
  might rest here for a time,\nand get to know each other better.\nIt's a long flight
  to Beta Quarelius Trigamma\nEpsilon Three, where the OSPEC meetings will\nbe held.\nWould
  you like to sit \ndown and have some Saurian Brandy?\n\n.pd\nIf you like.\n\n.je\nHere
  I'll get you some and then I have\nto go and just check in with the computer about\nsomething
  that Mr. Jock said earlier, something\nthat is nagging me.  There you go, an excellent
  year.\n\n.pd\n(READING THE LABEL) Stardate 2534.5.\n\n.aa COMPUTER\nRecording.\n\n.je\nErase!
  \ (TO PRIDE)  I don't think that you should\nsay something like that around here.
  \ It's\nautomatically set to start taping the instant\nit hears the word Stardate-\n\n.aa
  COMPUTER\nRecording.\n\n.je\nErase, dammit. -the instant it hears, uh, \nthat word,
  and I don't think that we\nreally want to be recorded.  It would just excite\nJock
  when he cleans up the tapes at the end of the\nmonth.\n\n.pd\nAs you say.\n\n.je\nI'll
  be right back now.\n\n(PRIDE NODS.  AS JERK LEAVES THE ROOM, SHE WANDERS\nABOUT
  LOOKING AT THE TRINKETS SPREAD HERE\nAND THERE ABOUT THE PLACE: A KLINGON WAR DILDO,\nA
  REPLICA OF THE FAMOUS STATUE OF THE TWO FOUNDING\nROMULANS SUCKING AT THE BREASTS
  OF A BAREEPY\nSANDSTALKER, A VOLUME OF WILD ANIMALS I HAVE\nKNOWN, THREE AUTOGRAPHED
  PICTURES OF DIANE MULDAUR,\nALL WITH DIFFERENT NAMES, AND A DARTBOARD WITH THE FACE
  \nOF MARTIN LANDAU ON IT.  SHE TURNS FROM ALL THIS\nPARAPHENALIA, AND SPEAKS TO
  HERSELF.)\n\n.pd\nSo the great Captain Jerk will now try to win my\nheart and the
  silicon of Booby.  Well, I shouldn't\nblame the poor dear, he really tries his\nbest
  for the Pederasty, in whatever way he can.\nRunning a starship is a big responsibility
  for men,\nand I don't know if the poor things can handle it.\n(PAUSE)  I wonder
  what he'll\ntry.  The Saurian Brandy is just a start of\ncourse.  Still, it's better
  than Tang.  (SIPS)\nIt might even be exciting.\nAfter all, anything's better than
  a boring\nspaceflight, even if our chief advisor did say\nthat mingling with non-boobies
  was bestiality.\n\n(THE LIGHTS DIM ON\nHER HALF OF THE STAGE AND WE SEE JERK SITTING\nBESIDE
  THE COMPUTER.)\n\n(LIGHTS UP ON JERK.)\n\n.je\nAll right, computer, tell me everything
  that you\nknow about Boobies.\n\n.aa COMPUTER\nWorking.  Boobies: Twentieth century
  slang \nfor ...\n\n.je\nNot that.  The planet Booby and its inhabitants.\n\n.aa
  COMPUTER\nThe planet Booby.  In Tau Iota Tau system, second planet\nfrom the sun.
  \ Volume: 5.98 times l0 to the 24th herms. Distance\nfrom Tau Iota Tau: 0.98 A.U.
  \ Crust composition: ...\n\n.je\nEnough of that.  What I want to know is\nsomething
  about the romantic lives of the\ninhabitants.  I want something that really turns
  \nthem on.\n\n.aa COMPUTER\nNo on-off switch contained in life-forms.\n\n.je\nThat
  wasn't what I was talking about.  Come\non, computer, she's got me stumped.  I've\ngot
  to make a play for her for the Pederasty.\nAnd for the network - it's in my contract.
  \ But\nthis is a completely different type of woman\nthan I've ever met in all my
  travels through \nspace.  How do I handle her?\n\n.nf\n.in+5\n********************************************\n***to

  to find that debugger.\n(TO COMPUTER)  You're sure that there's nothing\nelse.\n\n.aa
  COMPUTER\nNothing that we can say in what is ostensibly \na family show.\n\n.je\nWell,
  I guess that I'll just have to go back\nand grasp the situation with both hands.\n\n(JERK
  LEAVES)\n\n.aa COMPUTER\nThis I've got to record.\n\n(LIGHTS DIM ON JERK.  LIGHTS

  Captain is doing tonight\n What deviltry is that Jerk pursuing tonight.\n.in8\n.fi\n\n(ENTER
  JERK.)\n\nJust as well, I couldn't think of any more\nof the words.\n\n.je\nSorry
  to keep  you waiting.  One of the\ncrew reported a problem with one of the engines.\n\n.pd\nOh,
  really.  What was it?\n\n.je\nWe found something clogging up one of\nthe number
  three vents. It was wearing\na red suit trimmed with white ermine and had little
  bits of\nreindeer sticking to it.  It's amazing what sort of things you\nrun into
  out here in space.\nBut enough of this.  Would you like some more\nSaurian Brandy?\n\n.pd\nCaptain,
  if I didn't know better, I would\nthink that  you were trying to make me\ndrunk.\n\n.je\nGood
  thing you know better.  (ASIDE)  I hope\nshe doesn't know better.\n\n.pd\nHow long
  will the journey take Captain?\n\n.je\nOh, at least another twenty-four hours, I\nwould
  say.  If you want the exact time, you\ncan ask Jock the next time you see him\ntomorrow
  morning.\n\n(PRIDE RAISES HER EYEBROWS.  JERK SMILES,\nAND WALKS TOWARDS HER MEANINGFULLY.)\n\n.pd\nCaptain?\n\n.je\nI'm
  sorry.  It's just that, I've\nnever seen eyes of such a beautiful,\nahhhh...  (HE
  CHECKS) Blue.\n\n.pd\n(LAUGHS)  I see.\n\n.je\nI don't know if  you realize this
  my dear,\nbut there are really very few things of any\ngreat interest to do on a
  long spaceflight.\nOhhh, we sometimes come across \namoebae the size of a galaxy
  or\nnarrowly avert an intergalactic war every now\nand then, but basically we don't
  have anything to do. \nAnd the women here...\nThey all call you Captain, and fall\ndutifully
  into your arms when the moment calls\nfor it, but it's really nothing that lasts
  until\nthe next week.  It's lonely being the captain of\na big starship, and I was
  wondering if you'd\ncare to make it a little less lonely.\n\n.pd \nMaybe I could
  send you a pet from Booby,\na Basilisk perhaps?\n\n.je\nI don't think you're following
  me.\n\n.pd\nYou're following me.\n\n.je\nOne way or another.\n\n.pd\nCaptain, is
  it me you love, or do you love\nme for  my silicon?\n\n.je\nDoes it matter?\n\n.pd\nNo.\n\n(THEY
  RUN TOWARDS EACH OTHER LIKE THE PEOPLE\nIN A HAIRSPRAY COMMERCIAL.  AT THAT MOMENT\nMACINTOSH
  COMES THROUGH THE DOOR.)\n\n.mc\nExcuse me, but am I intruding?\n\n(JERK AND THE
  BOOBY RUN INTO EACH OTHER AND\nFALL FLAT ON THEIR CANS.)\n\n.je\nAhhhh, not a bit
  Doctor, we were\njust furthering interplanetary relations.\n\n.pd\nWhat is it?  Is
  there something wrong with\nmy sister?\n\n.mc\nWell, I'm not sure.  Maybe you had\nbetter
  come down and fill\nme in on some of the details about the booby \nphysique that
  I don't know.  She tells\nme that  you were studying to be a doctor\nbefore you
  became the Pride.\n\n.pd\nYes, all right, can it wait?  The captain was\ngoing to
  uhhh, show me some of his medals.\n\n.mc\nAll out of etchings, eh?  Well, don't\nmake
  it too long.\n\n.je\nWhich one of us were you speaking to?\n\n.pd\nMmaybe I had
  better go with the doctor now,\nget this over with, and then I can come back\nand
  we can look at your medallions\nand what have you.\n\n.je\nNeed you ask?\n\n.pd\nIt
  wasn't a question.  All right Doctor, lead the\nway.\n\n.je\nCome back quick.\n\n(THEY
  LEAVE)\n\nDrat! Drat, drat, drat.  I could almost\nfeel my hands on that silicon.\nShe's
  a nice kid, too.  It's too bad that her\nsister got sick.\nOh well, I'm sure the
  Doctor will take good\ncare of her.\n\n.aa INTERCOM\n(WOLF WHISTLE)  Captain Jerk.\n\n.je\nJerk
  here.\n\n.aa INTERCOM\nI think that you had better come up to the\nbridge, sir.
  \ We've found something strange.\n\n.je\nI'm on my way.  Jerk off.  (PAUSE)\nDrat.
