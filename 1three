  III''FASS'\nAct 1, Scene 3 - Intro\n\n(BLACK STAGE. SHIP MODEL SWINGING ON A STRING
  ILLUMINATED BY A SPOT.\nSTAR TREK THEME BEGINS)\n\n.je\nFarce: the final frontier.
  These are the voyages of the starship\nSatirize; its five year mission (four year
  honours, three year general)\nto explore strange new subjects, to seek out night
  life and new\nlibations, to blindly go where no man has gone before.\n\n(LIGHTS
  UP ON JERK IN CAPTAIN'S CHAIR CHISELLING ON LOG AND \nDODGING THE SHIP AS IT SWINGS
  ON THE STRING)\n\n.je\nCaptain's log, stardate...uh... today. The IUD Satirize has\nbeen
  granted a great honour: to escort their serene cleavages,\nthe Prize and the Pride
  of the planet Booby, to a meeting of\nOSPEC, the Organization of Silicon Producing
  and Exporting\nCivilizations. It is imperative that we win the Boobies'\nsupport,
  for without their vast reserves of silicon the\nGalactic Pederasty will quickly
  deplete its existing supplies\nof silicon-based fuels. (CALLS OFFSTAGE) File this,
  Yeoman,\nand don't let Spotty get his hands on it; last week he\nburned a month's
  worth of records in his blasted engines.\nOh, and get me another chisel - I think
  this one's running\nout.\n\n(LIGHTS DOWN ON JERK AND UP ON BOOBIES AND EXPENDABLE
  CREW\nMEMBER)\n\n.aa ECM\nCome along, your ladyships, the Satirize is ready to go\nas
  soon as you're abroad - I mean aboard. We've gone to no \nexpense to make this a
  very memorable trip, your Ladyships.\n\n.pz\nI'll enjoy the trip  much more if you'll
  stop saying \"your\nLadyships\". Call me the Prize Booby, as all my loyal subjects
  do.\n\n.pd\nYes, and you can call me the Pride Booby.\n\n.pz\nHush up, Pride. You're
  boring when you gush so.\n\n.pd\nWhen I gush?! Look at Old Faithful spouting off.\n\n.pz\nNow
  look here, you bi-\n\n.aa ECM\nLadies, please! Don't fight. There's no need for
  it. Now\nkiss and make up. (THEY HESITATE) After all, how do you think\nthis looks
  to your loyal subjects and admirers? \n\n(PRIZE AND PRIDE EMBRACE)\n\nIsn't that
  nice: Prize and Pride together again!\n\n.pd\nAre you sure this trip is necessary?\n\n.pz\nNecessary?
  It's vital! These people need our silicon to keep their\nspacecraft going and we
  need their money to keep our planet going.\nNo one knows the size of our reserves,
  so we've got to play our cards\nclose to our chests. Think of what we can do for
  our planet with\nthe money we make: modernize industry, keep abreast of the latest\nadvances.
  Thank God for the energy crisis!\n\n.pd\nYou realize that some of their planets
  think that the OSPEC planets\nmade up this crisis so that we could inflate our profits?\n\n.pz\nBullcookies!
  How could small planets like ours create such a shortage?\nThe planet Booby stands
  Humble, its Standard waving across the\nGulf of space. Our Shell of a planet lies
  open to its Mobil\nenemies, eager as Beavers to Gain our resources. Lies\nI say!
  This falsehood shall be exposed! We shall be Exxonerated!\nLet our silicon provide
  a Starburst of Bonuses for our planet.\n\n.pd\nBy gosh, the Prize is right! Oil
  bet we make a million. I'm\nglad I'm part of this Big Red Team.\n\n.aa ECM\nIf you
  ladies are quite ready, we had breast - uhh -\nbust - uhh - BEST be on our way.\n\n(LIGHTS
