  \ Let's get out of here.\n\n56-DAVE(2):  I'm afraid the engineers refuse to row
  the ship\n   any further.  So, you see folks, we're stuck here with no\n   escape.\n\n5\b5\b57\b7\b7-V\bV\bVO\bO\bOI\bI\bIC\bC\bCE\bE\bE(1\b1\b1):
  \ Man the lifeboats!\n\n58-DAVE(3):   I'm  afraid we have no more life-boats.  Quiet\n
  \  please!  All is not lost.  I'm happy to say we have plen-\n   ty  of life-savers.
  \ I'll have to ask everyone to line up\n   for his or hers.  There are plenty to
  \ go  around  but  I\n   must ask for women and children first.\n\n(THE  PASSENGERS
  \ ALL  LINE  UP AND DAVE PULLS OUT A PACK OF\nCANDIES.  HE SPEAKS TO THE FIRST PERSON
  IN LINE.)\n\n   All right, which would you like?   I've  got  peppermint,\n   wintergreen,
  lime...\n\n(AS DAVE BEGINS TO DIVVY OUT THE LIFE-SAVERS TO THE OUTRAGED\nPASSENGERS,
  THE COMEDY MORTICIANS COME OUT, SEE  THE  BODIES\nAND  TRY TO SEE WHICH TO PICK
  UP.  AT THE SAME TIME WE BEGIN\nTO HEAR THE SOUNDS OF WIND AND  BUZZING,  WHILE
  \ THE  LIGHTS\nSTART  TO  FLICKER.  THE PEOPLE ON STAGE ROCK BACK AND FORTH\nAS
  THE TURMOIL GETS LOUDER.  THE COMEDY MORTICIANS DECIDE ON\nTHE  FIRST BODY TO THROW
  OVERBOARD, AND IT HAPPENS TO BE THE\nBOMB WHICH IS LYING ON THE POINT.  THE BOMB
  IS CARRIED  AWAY\nAS  EVERYTHING BUILDS TO A FEVER PITCH. WE HEAR THE FAMILIAR\nONE
  TWO THREE HEAVE HO, SPLASH, AND  THEN  A  LOUD  CRASHING\nBOOM, AND A COMPLETE BLACK-OUT.)\n\n
