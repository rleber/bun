:content: ! ".so fass/fasshole\n.he 'FASS'- % -'ACT I SCENE XIII'\n.FO 'ACT I SCENE
  XIII''FASS'\nAct 1, Scene 13 - Transporter Room\n\n.rb\nBlast, I thought that the
  transporter would be unguarded\nat this hour of the night.  You there, Yeoperson,
  what are you doing here?\n\n.aa YEOPERSON\nWaiting for the ship to come in line
  with Quinqus Senteria Iota\nGamma Four, sir.\n\n.rb\nBut that's in the next system
  - we won't reach that for another hour at least.\nWhat do we want on that planet
  anyway?\n\n.aa YEOPERSON\nWe're transporting up three hundred tons of Turkish Delight.\n\n.rb\nThat's
  ridiculous.\n\n.aa YEOPERSON\nHaven't you ever heard of transports of delight?\n\n.rb\nI
  wish I hadn't.  Say, Yeoperson, you're looking a little peaked;\nhave you been taking
  all your space pills?  Have you had your\nGertrude Stein flu vaccination yet?\n\n.aa
  YEOPERSON\nWhy no, sir, but I've had all the standard flu vaccinations. A\nvaccination
  is a vaccination is a vaccination, sir.\n\n.rb\nI'm the doctor around here and I
  say it sounds like you need a \nshot.\n\n(HE LEAPS AND INJECTS THE YEOPERSON WITH
  HIS NEEDLE)\n\n.aa YEOPERSON\nWhat...victory to the Icelandic people!\n\n.rb\nMaybe
  that batch should have been stirred up a little -\nit seems as if it was a little
  impure.\n\n.aa YEOPERSON\nAll hail the glorious revolution of Tonga.\n\n.rb\nYes,
  yes, very well, why don't you come and help me bring\nin the Boobies.\n\n.aa YEOPERSON\nI
  have nothing to lose but my brains.\n\n.rb\nSmashingly well said.\n\n(THEY GO OFFSTAGE
  AND BRING ON THE BOOBIES.  THE BOOBIES\nARE TIED UP VERY LOOSELY.  PRICE IS STILL
  SLEEPING, BUT\nPRIDE IS WIDE AWAKE AND ANGRY. SHE IS GAGGED.)\n\n.rb\nWell, there
  they are.  They both played right into my \nhands.  Now all I have to do is get
  them down to the \nplanet.  Tell me, are the co-ordinates for the \ntransporter
  set?\n\n.aa YEOPERSON\nA glorious, victorious yes.\n\n.rb\nThis babe is getting
  on my nerves.  Ah, Yeoperson, do you have\na phaser on you?  Could I borrow it for
  a second?\n\n.aa YEOPERSON\nProperty is slavery.\n\n.rb\nDon't break it, just give
  it to me.  All right.\nShall I factorial her or perhaps\nuse a barrage of gamma
  functions?  No, she might turn green and start\njumping about shouting, \"People
  Smash Puny Imperialists!\"\nHyperbolic sine?  No, I'll just hit her with a cosh.\n\n(HE
  DOES SO AND THE YEOPERSON CRUMBLES)  \n\nAll right, is that\neverything?  We're
  over the planet now, and it should be\neasy to beam down.  Just one little problem.
  \ I've got to\nfigure out some way that they won't be able to follow me.\nSabotage
  the transporter?  But then how could I get down\nto the planet after I sabotaged
  it?  I know!  I'll destroy the\nring modulator.  Yes, yes, my proud Boobie, what
  is it?\n\n(HE REMOVES PRIDE'S GAG.)\n\n.pd\nWhat's a ring modulator?\n\n.rb\nA lot
  of people were hoping you'd ask that.  You see,\nthat's the value of asking questions,
  because if there's\nsomething you don't know, the odds are good that half the\nclass
  wants to ask the same question but are too afraid\nto do so.  Never be afraid of
  asking questions my dear.\n\n.pd\nWhat's a ring modulator?\n\n.rb\nDon't repeat
  yourself, my dear , it's bad form.\n\n.pd\nBut I want to know what a ring modulator
  is.\n\n.rb\nA ring modulator is just an ideal little module designed\nby a group
  of monoids over on Clifford Grassman 3\nto govern the fields of energy over the
  domain of \ncurved topological space through which the transported body\nis sent.
  \ I could explain it in more detail, but\nwhat does a Booby know about curvature?\n\n.pd\nThat
  doesn't tell me a great deal.\n\n.rb\nWhat it boils down to is that this little
  baby was \ninstalled so that a few minutes after it\nwas destroyed it would be unsafe\nto
  transport anything bigger than a bread box.\n\n.pd\nWhy a bread box?\n\n.rb\nDon't
  ask such stupid questions.\n\n.pd\nYou remind me of a professor I had in...\n\n.rb\nQuiet.
  \ (HE PUTS THE GAG BACK ON HER.)  Too bad I used\nthe last of my MLM triple-T on
  that Yeoperson, or I'd \ngive you a shot too.  Okay, he said that everything\nwas
  set, so I guess I just pull the switch and go.\n\n(ENTER JOCK)\n\n.jo\nNot so fast,
  Macintosh.\n\n.rb\nWhat?\n\n.jo\nI'll make no bones about it. Macintosh, you're
  a spy.\n\n.rb\nAll right, you've got me Jock, but you'll never \ncatch me.  My phaser
  is set on arctan and it will kill\nyou by degrees.\n\n.jo\nDo not be a fool, whoever
  you are.  You are acting most\nillogically.\n\n.rb\nI warn you, don't take another
  step.  Too bad for you.\nTake that. And that.  And that.  And a couple more.\nI
  don't understand, Mr. Jock.  Why didn't you intersect\nthe floor at an odd angle?\n\n.jo\nThat's
  an acute question.\n\n.rb\nAnd that's an obtuse answer.\n\n.jo\nI'm a Vulcan: nothing
  phases me.\n\n.rb\nThen I guess I'd just better run for it.\n\n(HE FLICKS\nA SWITCH
  ON THE CONTROL PANEL, KICKS JOCK OUT OF THE \nWAY, AND JUMPS ON THE TRANSPORTER
  PLATFORM WITH THE \nBOOBIES.  JOCK GETS UP OFF THE FLOOR, RUNS TO THE \nCONTROL
  PANEL, AND GRABS A KNOB ON THE CONSOLE.  \nIT COMES OFF.\nBRASSIERE AND THE BOOBIES
  DISAPPEAR.  JERK AND THE\nREST OF THE LANDING CREW ENTER ALMOST IMMEDIATELY.)\n\n.je\nWhat
  is it, Jock?\n\n.jo\nAs I expected, Dr. Macintosh was not the real McCoy.\n\n.je\nAn
  impostor?\n\n.cl\nI thought that he had been slouching a little lately.\n\n.je\nWell,
  where is he now?\n\n.jo\nHe attempted to beam down to the planet, but I was\nable
  to change the co-ordinates of the transporter\nto send him to the farm house we
  have in tow.\n\n.je\nStrapping good, Jock.  Torothy, is there by any chance an intergalactic\nhyperspace
  Jammison-Freeby communications device \ninstalled in the farm house?\n\n.ty\nUncle
  Ben has a CB.\n\n.je\nSame thing.  Lieutenant Huaryu, raise the farm house. \nI
  want to talk to our impostor.\n\n.hu\nYes, sir.  Breaker one-oh, breaker one-oh,
  this\nis Foxy Lady. You got a copy on me, Appleseed, come on.\n\n.rb\n(VOICE OVER)
  \ Blast it, how did you send me here?\n\n.je\nJock was quick on the draw.\n\n.hu\nNo
  names, Captain.  He means that you can chalk that one \nup to Mr. Pointy-ears, good
  buddy.\n\n.je\nYou can't get away now.  We can just leave you over \nthere and drag
  you to the nearest space station and \nyou couldn't do a thing about it.\n\n.rb\nDrat,
  you're right!  All right, we'll negotiate.\n\n.je\nNegotiate!  What do you have
  for bargaining power?\n\n.rb\nAhh, let me see.\n\n(A FLUSHING SOUND IS HEARD IN
  THE\nBACKGROUND. SHUDDERS FROM THE CREW)\n\n.je\nWhat was that?\n\n.rb\nOh, just
  one of the Boobies.  Look, I'm sure\nthat I have something to bargain with.\n\n.je\nWas
  she...ah... flushing something?\n\n.rb\nWell, what do you think she was doing?  Look,
  I'm\nsure there must be something  I have that I can trade,\nat least for my freedom.\n\n.je\nAhhh,
  I don't know about that, but the Pederasty was\nfounded on the principles of diplomacy,
  good will and \nall that stuff.\nI think that we can afford to talk.  I'll beam
  right \nover.\n\n.aa ALL\nWe'll go with you. (AND SIMILAR SOUNDS)\n\n.je\nLook,
  we'll have to - er - negotiate in shifts.  Jock,\ndue to your unusual biological
  makeup, you can remain\nbehind.\n\n.su\nUnusual biological makeup, sir?\n\n.je\nYes,
  Jock's intestines are in his head.\n\n(JOCK SPITS)\n\nNow, first off I'll take Lieutenant
  Huaru, Lieutenant\nSuru, Ensign Gogol-\n\n.to\nThat's Tolstoy.\n\n.je\nEnsign Whatever
  and Nurse Chappedlips.  Oh, we'd better\ntake you along too, Torothy,  so that you
  can show us\nthe layout of the house.\n\n.ty\nAll right.  Can I bring Dodo?\n\n.je\nIf
  you must, but you'll have to hold him - only six\ntransporter disks.  Mr. Jock?\n\n.jo\nYes,
  sir.  Ready?\n\n.je\nReady.  This shouldn't take long, Jock. We'll be back \nin
  a flush - er - energize.  \n\n(THEY DISAPPEAR)\n\nfin\n"
