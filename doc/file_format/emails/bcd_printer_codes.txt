The Media Codes page says the following about media code 3:
print image BCD. Media3 records always contain printer control codes

I found the BCD character set page at http://www.thinkage.ca/english/gcos/expl/bcd.html

However, this character set makes no provision for "printer control codes". How was that accomplished?

[Quoted text hidden]
The printer hardware took ? (017 ignore) and ! (077 escape)
as having special meanings:

17 ignore this and don't print anything
   This allowed a programmer to align the things he wanted to change
   on word boundaries easily.  e.g.
       a?????b????? would print just "ab" (only two columns).
20 print 1 space (as you would expect)

777717 (!!?) print a single question mark "?"
777777 (!!!) print a single exclamation mark "!"
7777nn  where nn is not 17 or 77.
        for printers that had upper/lower toggle case
        and print the character.  Maintain the case state
        until end of record or next shift sequence.
        Waterloo convention is that BCD starts out as lower case.
The other escape sequences are all 77nn, and do blank and slew
insertion.
nn 00->17 Slew by countdown
          slew nn lines. so "!0" advances zero lines and allows
          overprinting the same line (read as a CR "\r").
          "!1" is would be a newline "\n" and "!4" would
          4 newlines ("\n\n\n\n")
   20     Slew to top of page (formfeed "\f")
   21->37 Slew to channel (nn & 017).  Slew until a matching
          4 bit pattern is found punched on the VFC tape (or
          in the VFC virtual image.  Note when punching
          a VFC tape or defining a virtual VFC it was important
          to make sure you defined all 15 patterns or the
          printer could try to empty a whole box of paper in minutes.
   40->57 Relative tab, Insert ((nn & 017) << 3) spaces.
             I.e. multiply lower 4 bits by 8 and print
          that many spaces (8->120)
   60->76 Same as 7777.  Doubt this was ever used.

A slew sequence ends the record, and anything following is
ignored.  Normally the rest of the words are padded with
spaces, zeros or ignores ("?"s).  However, if there
isn't a slew, the line continues on the next record.
Cobol would handle the "AFTER ADVANCING n LINES" by
putting out 1 word slew record, followed by the
a record with no slew, and just the line image.

GE's invention of slew by countdown basically made slew
to channel obsolete.  If you used slew by countdown the
operator usually did not need to change the VFC for
special jobs.  However the convention was buried into
so many Cobol and Fortran programs that it needed to
be supported.  We never used it at Waterloo, so all our
software just reads any slew to channel in media 3 as slew to
top of page (FF).

It seems we have a bug in our media3 reader and it is treating
7760nn->7776nn the same as 1717nn.  I.e. just ignoring the
the two characters.
