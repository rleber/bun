Bun Configuration settings

Most settings are stored in a configuration file, in YAML format. They may be listed
and set using the bun config commands.

In addition, the command checks the "REPOSITORY" environment variable to determine the
location of the online repository.

Use "bun config ls" to list the current configuration settings. Use "bun config define"
to list definitions of the settings.
