Bun Configuration settings

Most settings are stored in a configuration file, in YAML format. They may be listed
and set using the bun config commands. Normally, the configuration file is saved in
~/.bun_config, although this may be overridden by setting the "BUN_CONFIG" environment
variable.

Use "bun config" command to manage configuration settings. More specifically, 
"bun config init" initializes configuration settings, and "bun config ls" lists them.
All the "bun config" commands may be listed by the command "bun config help".
