TODO
Add tests for bun rm, bun mv
Change archive.location to something else
Why doesn't ls -ldr list Shards?
Move all test cases' input files to data/test directory
Make tests directory-independent (on listings)
What is output/test/archive_index_ls_original ?
Add column headings to output/test/archive_index_ls_original
Separate file.open from file.load/read
Set atime only when we actually read a file (not just the preamble)
Refactor archives vs. extracted archives (need a good name, e.g. store, hoard, stash, library)
Integrate bun archive text_status into bun ls
Resolve backspaces: to underlining or bold
Add --select option to bun ls
Add --select option to bun extract
File type for print listings (Qu: are these ever frozen?)
Try determining type by comparing preamble contents: Words 0..6, and 0..3 after specification; spec.last + 3 = 0333333 may mean binary load module
Why doesn't words[0].octal work?
Remove extraneous output files
Optimization ideas: Continue examining Indexable::Basic, since it's probably 10-15% of execution time: Reduce usage, optimize "center" code
Refactor Slicr based on the concept of layers, etc.
Ignore files not in the index
Implement Ian's naming conventions
Ability to 'bun archive ls' by archive name patterns
Ability to search xref'ed files, for example find files with multiple copies
Keep a .spec file in decoded archives showing how the archive is organized?
Flatten out code: freezer thaw => thaw (or even combine with unpack)
Option to include file modification date in unpacked or thawed file names
Option to turn off resetting file modification dates for unpacked or thawed files
Option to add an extension to unpacked or thawed files (e.g. '.txt')
Option to create archives organized like file/v1/file1, file/v2/file2, etc.
Look for Huffman-coded files: e.g. ar003.0701, ar116.2122, ar116.2128
Standardize Decode and Defrost interfaces: decode, instead of unpack/thaw
Change file patterns to tape::file(::shard)? Qu: how to specify whether it must be a shard?
Possibly caching of archive index?
Clean code
