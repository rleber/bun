Change bun show --file to file examination
File::Expression
    Setting of --min (e.g. with chars exam)
    Setting of --case (e.g. with chars exam)
    Syntax for referencing shard data (with index)
Consolidate exam, field, formula in bun find, map, and examine (and same?)
    Allow --inspect option
    Allow <field_or_exam_name> without e[] or f[] syntax
    Pseudo references: file_path, text, grade?
Tests for bun find, bun map
Add synthetic field descriptions: text, file_path
More extensions to bun examine
    Size in llinks -- only for packed or unpacked files
    Field_names
    Field_values
    Extended fields (pre-defined, e.g. tape basename, etc.)
        File name (with subfiles, etc.)
        File basename
    Printer listing
        Largely printable
        Very few large runs
        Overstruck
    Object file
        Very few large runs
        Largely unreadable
    Try determining type by comparing preamble contents:
        Words 0..6, and 0..3 after specification; spec.last + 3 = 0333333 may mean
            binary load module
Multiple output formats for bun examine, et al
Find duplicates
    Same file name
    Absolutely identical
bun file editor
    Checkout/checking (or in-place edit)
    Produce multiple synchronized lines
        9-bit ASCII
        8-bit ASCII
        7-bit ASCII
        hex
        octal
        decimal
    Look for edit marks (or a separate edit line)
        [...] {...} / \ dddd i
Should bun find be called bun grep?
Make catalog :remove the default; rename --keep?
Implement bun library clean
    Find duplicates
        Same file name
        Same MD5 hash
        Absolutely identical
    Remove unclean files
    Possible --tag option (place a tag saying what happened to files which were removed)
Implement bun library organize
    Keep a .bun_spec.yml file in decoded archives showing how the archive is organized?
    Option to turn off inclusion of file modification date in unpacked or decoded file names
    Option to turn off resetting file modification dates for unpacked or decoded files
Allow decoding and baking frozen archives to STDOUT
    Insert separators
        Allow separators to be overridden
    bun decode should work
    bun bake should work
    bun archive decode should work
    bun archive bake should work
Release version 1.0
Major rewrite:
    All files are just Hashie::Mashes
        File.unpack(<packed file>) unpacks a packed file
        No packed file object(?) (except as needed to unpack files)
    No file descriptor object
    No Data object (except as needed to unpack files)
    Limited distinction (if any), between file types
        Possibly File::Decoded, File::Text, and File::Frozen
        File::Text and File::Frozen should be File::Unpacked::Text and File::Unpacked::Frozen
    No distinction between libraries and archives
        Archives don't care how they're organized
    Simpler model for file promotion, using inheritance
Alternate data storage formats: raw, binary, octal, hex
Complete tests:
    archive catalog (check descriptor 'catalog_time' has been changed; test --remove)
    archive compare_dates
    archive pull
    archive text_status
    config *
    library compact (complete tests)
        For all files:
            collapse tape names to the oldest if the content is identical
            collapse tape name entirely if there's only one version
        For text files:
            Collapse dates to the oldest, if the content is identical
            If there's only one date, collapse the date altogether (?)
            If there's more than one date, collapse the HHMMSS unless the YYMMDD is identical
        For frozen shards:
            Above rules apply within a frozen file
            For frozen files, similar rules apply:
                Collapse dates to the oldest, if the content is identical
                If there's only one date, collapse the date altogether
                If there's more than one date, collapse the HHMMSS unless the YYMMDD is identical
    library classify
    library put
    library push
Create bun library (or archive) push
Combine archive, library
Document new process: pull, unpack, catalog, decode, find, list/describe, clean, organize, extract, push
Check out lib/clean.rb
Implement interactive (or stream) editor:
    Could you use sed, vim, Textmate as a backend?
    /pat/[bxoa]? pattern matching (e.g. b for binary, a for ascii, etc.)
    p command shows a dump in multiple formats
    Alternatively: check out the contents (in whatever format), edit, then check them back in again

_Medium Priority_
bun catalog should be able to recatalog files of all grades
Other output formats, e.g. xls, html
Better audit trail mechanism: Where did a file come from?
    Unpack should record where unpacked from/to
    Decode should record where decoded from/to
    Compress should record where moved from/to (where?)
    Better syntax for reverse find: i.e., where did a baked file come from?
bun dump pre-block padding repair
bun dump with or without block preambles and llink preambles
Symlink readme and todo in top directory
Review miscellaneous TODOs in the source files
Encapsulize test pattern: should create output, with this format, etc.
Refactor test with create_file, create_directory, clean
Is archive even necessary? Could we not just do e.g. bun decode archive/**, etc.?
file_type should never be :packed -- it should be :text or :frozen
Change :text file_type to :flat (and :frozen to :library ?)
Multiple readme files, accessible via readme FILE (with readme --ls)
Resolve backspaces: to underlining, overstrike or bold (explore 'col' command)
Convert troff to HTML or Markdown, or some other modern format (explore 'groff -T')
Refactor the tests into smaller sets
Remove places code
Remove config code?
Remove extraneous code
    places
    config
    sandbox
    compare_dates
    collection cp, mv, etc.
Move all system calls into Shell class
Remove shell.log code
Add long_desc to all methods
Refactor Bots to use Actors (or put methods (e.g. decode, dump) into the data objects)
Optimization ideas: Continue examining Indexable::Basic, since it's probably 10-15% of execution time
    Reduce usage, optimize "center" code
File type for different kinds of files:
    Object files
    Roff command files
    Scripts
    Print listings (Qu: are these ever frozen?)
More flexible output options:
    CSV output
    Non-justified (immediate output)
Loose hook to output printing (e.g. use rleber-table)
Gemify
    Move Slicr to a gem
    Move Bot::Base to a gem; provide tests
    Build Bun as a gem
    Revise installation readme
    Upload to Github

_Low Priority_
Allow multiple files in certain commands
Combine freezer ls with bun ls
Combine bun describe with bun ls
Combine freezer dump with bun dump
Combine archive decode and decode
Option to customize extension on unpacked or decoded files (e.g. '.txt')
Create Slicr command line tools (e.g. a filter)
Refactor Slicr based on the concept of layers, etc.
