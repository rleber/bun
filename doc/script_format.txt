Scene 1 - 1 : How To Write A Conveniently Formatted Script


<Stage directions are in pointy brackets. There should be one at the start to set the scene.>

Character1: Egads! I am speaking a line of dialogue! How fortunate that it was clearly indicated by a character name, followed by a colon.

Character2: Yes, quite fortunate! <gravely> But can we speak in unison?

<Character1 and Character2 perform another action of some sort.>

Character1, Character2: Yes, we can!


    SONG: We Also Have A Song
    (to the tune of 4:33 by John Cage)
    
    Character1:
    I see that this verse
    Is to be sung by me
    For my name's indicated
    At the start, with a colon
    
    Character1, Character2:
    Together we sing
    That's talking with pitches
    And then if we're lucky
    It sounds kind of good
    

Character2: Seems simple enough.

<Blackout.>
