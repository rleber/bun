  XI''FASS'\nAct I, Scene 11 - Finding the farmhouse.\n\n(ON THE BRIDGE.)\n\n.je\n(ENTERING)
  All right, Mr.Jock, what have we got?\n\n.jo\nWe have picked up a small object floating
  directly ahead\nof us sir, near that small planet.\n\n.je\nWhat is the name of the
  planet, Jock?\n\n.jo\nOh, it's just some uncharted planet.\n\n.to\n.nf\n*********************************************\n***to
  the tune of \"Some Enchanted Evening\"***\n*********************************************\n
  \    Some uncharted planet...\n.fi\n\n.je\nNone of that, Ensign; analysis of the
  object Mr.Jock.\n\n.jo\nIt would appear to be made almost entirely out of wood.\n\n.je\nWood?\n\n.jo\nYes,
  Captain.\n\n.to\nKeptain, we are getting wisual contact with the object.\n\n.je\nPut
  it on the screen, Mr.Pushkin.\n\n.to\nThat's Tolstoy.\n\n.je\nWhatever.\n\n.to\nWisual
  on,sir.\n\n.je\nI can't see anything.  Malfunction of the viewing screen?\n\n.jo\nFrugality
  on the part of the props people, more  likely.\n\n.je\nTell me what you see when
  it comes up, Ensign.\n\n.to\nKeptain, Keptain, I can see it now.  It looks like....\nit
  looks like..... it looks like a farmhouse.\n\n.je\nA farm house?\n\n.to\nYes, and
  it has a sign out front. It says...  \"Crad House\".\n\n.je\nAre you sure it's a
  \"C\"?\n\n.to\nIt's a long way off, Keptain.\n\n.jo\nPicking up lifeform readings,
  Captain.\n\n.je\nIdentify.\n\n.jo\nTwo lifeforms.  One a humanoid female, approximately
  ten\nyears old, the other a dog of some sort.\n\n.je\nSpotty, get down to the transporter
  room and bring\nthem aboard.  I want them up on the bridge to answer some\nquestions.\n\n.st\nAye,
  Captain. (EXITS)\n\n.jo\nTypical earth type house of the twentieth century, Midwest\nUnited
  States I would guess.\n\n.je\nWell, we'll soon know who we're dealing with.  Mr.Suru,\nlock
  onto the house with our Massey-Ferguson Tractor beam.\n\n.su\nAye, sir.\n\n(ENTER
  TOROTHY AND DODO, FOLLOWED BY SPOTTY.  THEY LOOK AROUND\nTHE BRIDGE, LOOKING AT
  ALL THE FLASHING LIGHTS, AND ALL THE\nPEOPLE IN VARIOUS POSITIONS.  ARE YOU READY
  FOR THE IMMORTAL LINE?)\n\n.ty\nSomehow, I don't think we're in Kansas anymore,
  Dodo.\n\n(SHE LOOKS AT MR.JOCK WHO LOOKS BACK AT HER WITH ONE EYEBROW LIFTED.)\n\n.je\nNo,
  my dear, you are on the bridge of the starship Satirize,\nits five-year mission
  (four years honours, three year general) -\n\n.jo\nCaptain -\n\n.je\nSorry.  I am
  James T. Jerk.\n\n.ty\nWhat does the T. stand for?\n\n.je\n\"The\".\n\n.ty\nI'm
  Torothy, and this is my dog Dodo.\n\n.to\nOh, Dodo, the dog from outer space.\n\n.ty\nWe're
  not from outer space.  We're from Kansas.\n\n.jo\nMuch the same thing.\n\n.je\nWhat
  are you doing out here then?  How did your house come to\nbe floating around this
  planet?\n\n.ty\n(SNIFFLES) It's a long sad story, Captain Jerk,\nand I don't think
  that I should bother you with it.\n\n.je\nWell, all right then -\n\n.ty\nIt's not
  as if it's a dull story, in fact some may think that\nit was interesting, but it's
  just too painful to trot out my\ntale of woe and deprivation and the evil that led
  me into this\nsituation.\n\n.je\nFine.  Mr. Jock, prepare to leave orbit and set
  -\n\n.ty\nAll right, I'll tell you the whole sordid mess. But don't blame\nme if
  you shed more than one tear over my story.\n\n(JERK SIGHS. JOCK LOOKS AT THE CEILING
  . TOLSTOY PULLS OUT A\nPAD AND PENCIL.)\n\n.ty\nMy Uncle Ben owned a rice farm in
  the wilds of Kansas.\n\n.st\nRice in Kansas?\n\n.ty\nIt had been a wheat farm, but
  he converted it to rice.\n\n.je\nI shudder to think what he called it.\n\n.ty\nHe
  called it MacRonald's Farm.  That was his name, Ben MacRonald.\n\n(A COLLECTIVE
  SIGH OF RELIEF FROM THE BRIDGE CREW AND THE CRITICS.)\n\nAnyway, we made a good
  living off\nthe rice, until one day, Uncle Ben was approached by an indidious\norganization
  who were buying up all of Kansas to make it into an\nairport: Clarabelle or something
  like that.\n\n.je\nAnd?\n\n.ty\nWell, of course, Uncle Ben wouldn't think of selling.
  \ I mean,\nit had taken him thirty years to get the land clear,\nget his rocks off
  and so forth.\nSo he kicked the people off\nthe property.\n\n.st\nJust what he should
  have done - a man's home is his castle and \nhe should protect what he's got.\n\n.ty\nThat's
  what Uncle Ben said.  Anyway, these men kept on coming\nback over and over again,
  trying to cow Uncle Ben into selling \nout to Clarabelle.  They began to sneak into
  the back forty\nat night with signs saying, \"All hail the glorious site\nof the
  new people's Airport and Centre of Progressive \nAviatory Thought.\"\n\n.je\nWho
  were these men anyway?\n\n.ty\nThey said they belonged to the Alabaman Industrial
  Association\nof Insidious Aviators.\n\n.je\nThe AIAIA.\n\n.jo\nSo it would seem,
  Captain.\n\n.ty\nIt got so that we couldn't go out into the fields on a Friday\nwithout
  seeing signs\nlike \"Victory to the Alabaman People\",\n\"Let them eat\nAirplanes\",
  \"Workers of the world unite - you have nothing \nto lose but these paddies!\"\n\n.st\nPaddies?
  With a name like MacRonald, I would have thought you were\nScottish.\n\n.ty\nEvery
  week it was the same thing.  We tried to complain to the\nsheriff, said that after
  all it was our land, and we should \nbe allowed to do what we wanted with it.\nBut
  the sherriff said that he wouldn't\nstifle the freedom of the press\nand if they
  wanted to press us, there was nothing he would do.\n\n.jo\nIt sounds as if the sherriff
  was acting illogically.\n\n.ty\nWe sort of knew that he wasn't on our side when
  he called \nus Bourgeois Pigs - and he had been eating Chile.\n\n.jo\nIndeed.\n\n.ty\nWell.
  \ The signs kept up for well over a year, and\nthey just got nastier and nastier.\nI
  mean, I've never even known\na cocker spaniel.\nOne day, Uncle Ben decided that\nhe
  had just had enough.  He went over to the gate,\nthe one that the AIAIA used to
  drive their trucks\nthrough when they were briging in the signs,\nand he just locked
  those nasty AIAIA people right out\nof the farm, just locked them right out.\n\n.je\nWhat
  happened?\n\n.ty\nWell, they drove around the gate of course. The fence hasn't\nbeen
  up over there for years.  It was a matter of principle.\nThe only\nthing that really
  happened was that the AIAIA got really mad\nand decided to take some positive action.
  \ Well, before you\nknew it they had gone back to Alabama\nto get their airplanes
  and helicopters and they were over top\nof the farm, buzzing the cattle and frightening
  the rice and \ncausing a real havoc.\n\n.je\nIt must have been pretty bad.\n\n.ty\nThe
  noise wasn't so bad, although that 747 made a bit of a \nroar, but it was the wind
  that they stirred up.  Boy those \nAIAIA people were a real bunch of wind-bags.\n\n.jo\nI
  can imagine.\n\n.ty\nWell, the wind just kept building and building.\nUncle Ben
  and Aunt Jemima went out to try\nto straighten things around, maybe shoot a few
  wingtips off,\nfriendly-like, but firm, but they were blown away.\nWasn't long before
  they had a regular\ntwister rolling, and the house lifted up right off its \nfootings,
  shook its booties a little, and was off into the \nsky.  We must have flew clear
  over the rainbow. Somewhere...\nsomewhere over the...\n\n.je\nA very very sad story
  my dear, and it seems as if you have \na song to sing for us?\n\n.ty\nIf you insist.\n\n.je\nNot
  particularly.\n\n.ty\nSince you press me.\n\n(A TRILL ON THE PIANO, GLISS GOING
  UP \nAND SOUNDING LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE \"SOMEWHERE OVER THE \nRAINBOW\".  THEN....)\n\n.nf\n.in+5\n***********************************\n***to
  the tune of \"Old McDonald\"***\n***********************************\nOld MacRonald
  had a farm\nAIAIA\nAnd on this farm he had some signs.\nAIAIA.\nWith a \"Bourgeois\"
  here\nAnd a \"Bourgeois\" there.\nHere a Boor, there a Joie\nEverywhere a Bourgeois,\nOld
  MacRonald had a farm.\nAIAIA.\n\n....at McRonald's they did it all to us.\n.in8\n.fi\n\n.mc\n(ASIDE)
  \ It should just teach the old goat for being a wealthy\nBourgeois burgher.  Cheez.
  \ (HE TAKES A BITE OF HIS APPLE.)\n\n.je\nWhat was that, Macintosh? And what are
  you doing on the bridge\n- you should be looking after a sick Booby.\n\n.mc\nYessir.
  \ I just came up when I hear that something unusual had\nbeen found.  I thought
  that you might have need of me.\n\n.je\nNo, doctor, no emergency.  Return to your
  duties.\n\n.mc\nYes, Sir.  (ASIDE)  This is the opportunity that I've been waiting\nfor.
  \ I'll simply sneak into the transporter room and we'll \nbeam down to the planet's
  surface.  I'm homefree.\n(HE EXITS)\n\n.jo\n(LOOKING AFTER HIM)  Captain, there
  is something that disturbs me\nabout the Doctor's behaviour.\n\n.je\nWhat is it?\n\n.jo\nI
  can't quite put my finger on it.\n\n(HIS FINGER IS PERILOUSLY\nCLOSE TO HUARU'S
  BREATS AS HE STABS IN THE AIR.  SHE IS LOOKING\nSHOCKED.)\n\n.je\nWell?\n\n.jo\nI
  believe that it might be wise for me to follow him\nand see what he is up to.  It
  is altogether too easy to\nimpersonate one of the members of this crew.\n\n.je\nAll
  right, Mr. Jock, do that.  Mr. Solzhenitsyn, take over for\nMr. Jock.\n\n.to\nThat's
  Tolstoy.\n\n.jo\nNo, it's Jock.\n\n.to\n.ul\nMY\nname is Tolstoy!\n\n.je\nYou could
  change it to Smith and save us all a lot of trouble.\n\n.to\nSmith!?\n\n.je\nSmithski?
  \ Hmm.  Maybe it would be better if we stayed in orbit\naround this planet until
  we get to the bottom of this mess \nabout the farmhouse and Macintosh.  Prepare
  for course change,\nMr. Suru.\n\n.su\nI'm sorry sir. First, you'll  have to get
  your faculty advisor's\nsignature, as well as the initials of the professor involved
  and\nhis wife and his dog; and the milkman, the butcher, the baker,\nthe whip-maker,
  Burt Matthews' tailor .... \n\n(AND SO ON UNTIL\nTHE LIGHTS PEOPLE MANAGE TO BLACK
  OUT THE STAGE.)\n\nfin\n"
