  you to say that you were insurance agents?\n.ch ma\nNot in so many words, my friend;

  they're my elves.\n.ad\n(PAUSE WITH DUST ON IT.)\n.ch pa\nElves, sir?\n.ch ma\nDo
  we have a policy that covers elves, Paula?\n.ch pa\nThe question is, do we have
  a policy that\ncovers people who believe in elves.  I don't think it's\nlegal to

  you know.  Santa's spies manage\nto sneak into every house in the world at least
  once a year.\n.ch cr\nAnd then they report back through the mail.\n.ch ls\nYes,
  every nation in the world forwards kids' letters\nto Santa Claus, never dreaming
  that among the real letters\nare reports from the spies.\n.ch sc\nFor example, listen
  to this letter.\n\"Dear Santa: This year for Christmas I would like\na secret army

  \ We've had an embarassing experience with espionage\nthat we'd like to forget.\n.ch
  sc\nWhat kind of embarassing experience?\n.ch pa\nWe sold millions of dollars worth
  of insurance to\na bunch of spies.  What a disaster!\n.ch ma\nDo you know what collossal
  risks those people are,\ninsurancewise?  With every move they make, another chance\nthey
  take; the odds are they won't live to see tomorrow.\n.ch pa\nThat's why we were
  sent up here to the North Pole.\nIt's the Expendable Life Company's form of banishment.\n.ch
  sc\nWell, you two sure are a pair of suckers, aren't you?\nHow in the world could
  you ever be so stupid as to sell insurance to spies?\n.ch ma\nWe didn't know they
  were spies.  We thought they\nwere just regular employees of the Fassablanca Toy
  Company.\n.ad\n(PAUSE WITHOUT DUST ON IT)\n.ch sc\nDid you say...the Fassablanca
  Toy Company?\n.ch ma\nHave you heard of it?\n.ch sc\nHeard of it!\nHave I heard
  of the people who annually steal over a billion dollars of\nbusiness that is rightfully
  mine?  Have I heard of the\ncompany that steals every product idea I develop?\nHave
  I heard of the low-lifes who outbid me for the\nright to make Star Wars toys?\n.ch
  ma\nWell don't keep us in suspense; have you?\n.ch sc\nWhat are those little toadies
  doing with spies?\n.ch pa\nIt's kind of complicated.  Apparently they're\ncreating
  the war game to end all war games.\n.ch ma\nSo they hired a bunch of spies to steal
  actual battle\nplans from countries all over the world.\n.ch ls\nWow, talk about
  authenticity!\n.ch sc\n(CRACKING THE WHIP)\nShut up, Lickspittle!  (MUSING)  So,
  Fassablanca\nis stealing battle plans, is it?\n.ch ma\nIt's bound to make a dandy
  war game, Mr.Claus.\n.ch sc\n(SCREAMING)\nI know that!\n.ch ls\nIt could put us

  any more.\n.ch be\nWe wouldn't have to work day and night.\n.ch ar\nWe wouldn't

  you really going to spill the beans about Fassablanca?\n.ch sc\nMore or less.\n.ch
  ma\nWhat do you mean by that?\n.ch sc\nIf I just tell the truth about Fassablanca,
  they won't\nget into enough trouble.  After all, it's hard for a government to get\nexcited
  if its secrets have only fallen into the hands of a toy company.\n.ch pa\nSo what
  are you going to say?\n.ch be\nYou could tell the Russians that the company is a
  front for the Americans.\n.ch ar\nYou could tell the Americans that the company
  is a front for the Russians.\n.ch ra\nYou could tell everybody that the company
  is a front for the Albanians.\n.ch ls\n(TO RASPUTIN)  So who'd care?\n.ch sc\nYou
  people are thinking too small.  We need some\nsort of creative story that will bring
  the world down\non top of Fassablanca without causing serious repercussions.\n.ch
  be\nWe could say that the Fassablanca people are really alien invaders\nfrom some
  glorious planet that intends to take over the earth.\n.ch sc\nIt's been done.\n.ch
  ar\nWe could say that the Fassablanca people are making\nclones of Donny and Marie
  to release on a defenseless world.\n.ch sc\nImpossible --\n.ul\nI've\ngot the rights
  for Donny and Marie clones.\n.ch ra\nWe could say that Fassablanca was going\nto
  sponsor re-runs of Gilligan's Island.\n.ch sc\nNot even Fassablanca would be that
  fiendish.\n.ch ls\nWait a second!  We want to get all the governments\nin the world
  mad at Fassablanca, right?\n.ch sc\nRight.\n.ch ls\nThen all we have to do is say
  that Fassablanca\nis threatening the one thing that politicians love most.\n.ch
  cr\nWhat's that?\n.ch be\nMoney?\n.ch ar\nSex?\n.ch ra\nPop-tarts?\n.ch ls\nNo --
  lying.  We spread the word that Fassablanca has invented a toy\nthat will immediately
  determine whether or not someone is telling the truth.\n.ch cr\nA long distance
  lie detector!\n.ch ls\nRight.  Politicians don't want people to find out what they're
  really up to.\nThey'd do anything to stop Fassablanca.\n.ch sc\nGreat idea, Lickspittle...
  for a mindless lackey.\nYou understand what we've been saying, Grinchley?\n.ch gr\nYes
  sir!\n.ch sc\nYou know what you're supposed to tell the governments of the world?\n.ch
