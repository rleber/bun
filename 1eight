  SPOT UP - ANNOUNCER WALKS INTO THE LIGHT)\n\n.aa ANNOUNCER\nYes, a lot of people
  still have fond memories of last year's\nFASS show. And up until now, these people
  treasured what small \nscraps of dialogue and occasional humour they could recall,\nfull
  knowing that the ravages of time would some day cause them to forget\nthese and
  other fond Remembrances of Things Past. But not any more!\nNow K-Sell, in conjunction
  with Marcel Proust Associates, brings you\nthe greatest household wonder since the
  iceman!\n   Yes, it's the new \"Tanks for the Memory\". \"Tanks for the Memory\",\nthe
  fantastic new device that revolutionizes your recollections! - with\nno muss, no
  fuss. Here's how it works.\n   K-Sell has brought together all the bloopers, blown
  lines, ad libs\nand obscene asides from all of the FASS shows ever presented,\nINCLUDING
  THE CELEBRATED TALE OF THE NYMPHOMANIAC AND THE BROKEN\nDRIPOLATOR! Simply place
  the custom fitting, reversible,\ncontoured auditory receptacles on your ears,\nand
  instantly the sights and\nsounds of 15 years of questionable humour come rushing
  back to you.\nYes, relive the agony and the ecstasy of such famous lines as:\n\"Props!\"
  ... and of course: \"Kentucky Fried Christians!\" ... who could\nforget: \"He was
  trying to get it off in the Duke's Office.\" \n... and everyone's favourite: \"Is
  that your nose or did your\npants fall down?\" Isn't that amazing!\n   Yes, \"Tanks
  for the Memory\", the spectacular new commode\nfrom K-Sell. And, as a special introductory
  bonus get\n\"Abbatoir Magician\", the miracle device that slices, dices,\ndrops
  lint on your cat and recites the complete collection of all\nnon-slanderous jokes
  ever published in Enginews!\n   Remember, that's \"Tanks for the Memory\" and \"Abbatoir
  Magician\",\nboth from K-Sell, only $29.98 - $29.30 in Newfoundland.\n   Available
