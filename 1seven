  ground this morning.\n\n.aa CR3\nI think I got a rubber pie.\n\n.aa CR1\nGod's will,
  sister; God's will. Say has anybody seen my hotdog?\n\n.aa CR2\nI found it! It's
  over here with my tangburger. Spreading\nthe mustard, you might say.\n\n.aa CR1\nI
  don't relish the thought.\n\n.aa CR3\nEvery time I see the prices on that menu I
  feel sick.\n\n.aa CR4\nI know what you mean. I used to get the same feeling every
  time\nI saw the SELECTIONS on the menu. But not any more:\n.nf\n.in+5\n\n********************************************\n***to

  used to have a stomach,\nBut it isn't here today:\nThey took out my digestive tract\nAnd
  threw it all away.\nI now frequent Food Services,\nI eat here all the time.\nMy
  plastic gut will save me,\nBut the prices are a crime.\n.in8\n.fi\n\n(ENTER TOLSTOY,
  PRIZE (ON HIS ARM) AND PRIDE)\n\n.pz\nSo this is the cafeteria?\n\n.to\nActually,
  it's not a cafeteria, it's a mess.\n\n.pd\nThat's pretty obvious.\n\n.to\nI suggest
  you take a look at our menu.\n\n(THEY DO)\n\nSome people are a little put off by
  it, but most are thoroughly\ndisgusted.\n\n.pd\nIt's horrible! Is Tang the only
  thing they serve here?\n\n(COOKIE BURPS)\n\n.to\nI'm afraid so. That's all the Pederasty
  ever supplies its\nwessels with. Oh, very occasionally we get something special,\nlike
  fried tribbles, but basically it's nothing but\nTang, Tang, Tang-\n\n.aa CREW\n.nf\n.in+5\n***************************\n***to

  rowdy, like, before duh bar opens. \n\n.pz\nYou have a bar? (TO TOLSTOY) And I thought
  you said that there\nwas just Tang on board.\n\n.aa COOKIE\nAkshully dat's correct,
  like. But what we do is doctor it up\nwit' anyting in duh engine room we can find
  dat changes\nduh taste.\n\n.pd\nWhat kind of drinks do youse - er - you have?\n\n.aa

  you look into your soup today,\nYou're in for a big surprize.\nBut trying to eat
  any soup today,\nThat wouldn't be very wise.\n'Cause fifteen men have ate it today\nAnd
  fifteen men were carried away,\nFrom watching that group\nI'd guess that the soup's\nInfected.\n.in8\n.fi\n\n.to\nForget
  the soup. What's today's special?\n\n.aa COOKIE\nBreaded Tang Cutlets, same as yesterday,
  and duh day before, and\nduh day before dat -\n\n.to\nStill the same?! Cookie, you've
  had that same special for the last three\nmonths without any change!\n\n.aa COOKIE\nCan
  I help it if dere was a lot o' leftovers?\nAnyway, I've got a new recipe dat I'm
  achin' to try on\nyuz tomorrow.\n\n.to\nWhat?\n\n.aa COOKIE\nSumptin' called Montezuma's
  Revenge. I tink it's a Mexican dish.\n\n.to\nGive me a double helping today, Cookie.
  I don't think I'll be\nvery hungry tomorrow.\n\n.pz\nI think I should get some more
  too. It's going to be a long trip.\n\n.pd\nHere, take mine. I've lost my appetite.\n\n(THEY
  SIT DOWN)\n\nI don't see how you can stand food like this. And at these prices!\n\n.to\nI'm
  afraid it's out of our hands.\nYou see, increasing the quality and\nreducing the
  price involves some vast changes in policy -\n\n.pd\nYes?\n\n.to\nAnd they're afraid
  that if they only go through with half the\nalterations they'll be attacked for
  making\nanother half-vast policy change.\n\n(PRIZE MOANS)\n\nWhat's wrong? Russian
  humour too much for you?\n\n.pz\nI think something I ate didn't agree with me.\n\n.to\nI'd
  better notify the Kyeptin. \nHe'll probably want to take you... down to Sickbay,
  that is.\n(INTO INTERCOM) Kyeptin, Kyeptin, the Prize is ill; I think she had\ntoo
  many cutlets ... yes, a cutlet above the rest ... no, the Pride\nis all right. Why?
