  IV''FASS'\nAct 1, Scene 4 - The Bridge\n\n(LIGHTS UP ON BRIDGE: JERK IN HIS CHAIR,
  MCINTOSH STANDING BESIDE HIM,\nHUARYU AT HER CONSOLE, JOCK AT HIS, SURU ON HIS 'MOTORCYCLE'\nCONSOLE
  WITH TOLSTOY IN THE 'SIDECAR')\n\n.aa ECM\nAhem.\n\n(NO ONE NOTICES)\n\n.hu\nReady
  to leave orbit, Captain Jerk.\n\n.je\nThank you, Lt. Huaryu.\n\n.hu\n(LOOKS PUZZLED)
  I'm Lt. Huaryu, Captain.\n\n.je\nI should think you'd know who I was after all\nwe've
  been through together, Huaryu!\n\n.hu\nYou know who I am, and let's not broadcast
  all over subspace\nwhat we've been through.\n\n.jo\n(CHANGING THE SUBJECT) Course
  calculated...\n\n.to\n....and pre-registered, Kyeptin.\n\n.aa ECM\n(HAS BEEN CLEARING
  HIS THROAT WITH INCREASING VIGOUR THROUGHOUT\nTHIS DISCOURSE) Ahem, ahem!\n\n.je\nWha..?
  Say, that's a nasty cough you've got there. Doctor\nMacintosh, give him something
  for his cough.\n\n.rm\nSure thing, Jim. Here's a quarter.\n\n.hu\nThat's not much.\n\n.rm\nIt's
  not much of a cough. (HE LAUGHS, CREW IS STONE SILENT: HE STIFLES)\n\n.je\nAll right,
  people, that's enough. Cut it out!\n\n.to\nThyet's Dr. Macintosh's job,  Kyeptin.
  (HE LAUGHS, IBID. )\n\n.je\nHold it right there, Ensign! (HAND OVER EYES) Oh,no!
  \n\n.to\nAnd now I'll hold it over here!\n\n(GENERAL LAUGHTER)\n\n.je\n(TO ECM)
  By the way, who are you?\n\n.hu\nYes, Captain?\n\n.je\nNo, no, no, not you. (JUMPS
  UP AND DOWN, POINTING TO ECM)\nHim, him, hymn!\n\n.su\nHow about \"Onward Christian
  Soldiers\"?\n.to\nOh boy, charades! Sounds like... joint.\n\n.je\nAaaaaaaaaarrrrrrgh!\n\n.jo\nJoint
  - scream - it's obvious: a joint gets you high and\na scream is a high-pitched vocalism
  of little or no meaning.\nObviously he's trying to tell us that he's stoned and\ndoesn't
  know what he's saying. Really Captain, I'm ashamed;\na man in your position!\n\n(JERK,
  ANGUISHED TO THE POINT OF BEING ON HIS KNEES AND HOLDING \nHIS FACE, SUDDENLY LEAPS
  UP, GRABS ECM BY THE THROAT AND SHAKES\nHIM)\n\n.je\nWhat - is - your - name? Why
  - are - you - here? What - is - \nthis - all - about?\n\n.aa ECM\n(ON HIS KNEES,
  CHOKING) It's (GASP) Howdy Booby time!\n\n(JERK RELEASES ECM, WHO COLLAPSES IN A
  HEAP)\n\n.je\nWhat? Oh, my God, they're here; and this place is a mess! Quick, \nSuru,
  set phasers on dust.  Prize and Pride ... together-\n\n.pd\nSkip it, Captain, we've
  been through that once.\n\n.je\nYour Boobyships, please.  Welcome aboard.  Let me
  introduce you\nto my crew.\n\n(AS JERK INTRODUCES EVERYBODY, MACINTOSH MOVES\nFROM
  BESIDE THE CAPTAIN'S CHAIR,  EXAMINES ECM BRIEFLY\nAND REMAINS THERE STANDING.)\n\n.je\nThis
  is Lt. Huaru, our communications officer.\n\n.pz\nHow are you?\n\n.hu\nNo, Huaru.\n\n.pz\nI'm
  the Prize Booby.\n\n.hu\nSo's the Captain.\n\n.pd\nI thought he was Jerk.\n\n.hu\nThat
  too.  Who are you?\n\n.pd\nI'm the Pride booby, her sister.\n\n.hu\nI'm Lt. Huaru.
  \ How are you?\n\n.pz\nWhat an odd name.\n\n.hu\nWhat?\n\n.pz\nNo, Huaru.\n\n(HUARU
  ATTEMPTS TO ANSWER, BUT THE CAPTAIN CUTS HER OFF.)\n\n.je\nAh, this is our co-op
  Science officer, Mr. Jock.\n\n.pz\nDidn't you write a book on babies?\n\n.jo\nNo,
  madam, that would be illogical.\n\n.pz\nWhy?  Because you're a science officer?\n\n.jo\nNo,
  because babies tend to get the printing presses messy.\n\n.pz\nWhat about when they're
  older?\n\n.jo\nThat is a pressing question.\n\n.je\nAnd this is Lt. Suru, out pilot
  and weapons officer.\n\n.pd\nHow do you do?\n\n.su\nWhat?\n\n.pd\nPardon?\n\n.su\nI
  say, \"You're pardoned.\"\n\n.pz\nWhy?\n\n.su\nShe asked me.\n\n.pd\nWhat?\n\n.su\nHow
  I did; I mean, how I pardoned.\n\n.pz\nAre they all like this?\n\n.je\nNo, some
  of them are a little silly.\n\n.pd\nOh God.\n\n.je\nThis is Ensign Doestoyevski,
  our navigator.\n\n.to\nThat's Tolstoy, and \"nawigator\".\n\n.je\nSorry, Ensign
  Nawigator.\n\n.pz\nI say; you're Russian, aren't you?\n\n.to\nYes, why?\n\n.pz\nNo
  reason really, it's just been so long since I saw a red ensign flying.\nSee you
  later, nawigator.\n\n(SCUFFLE IN BACKGROUND AS BRASSIERE SNEAKS IN THE DOORWAY,\nGARROTES
  MACINTOSH AND STUFFS HIM INTO THE HATCH MARKED \"TANG\nCONVERTER\".)\n\n.je\n(TURNING
  AROUND AFTER THIS IS DONE) Oh yes; this is our medical officer, Dr.\nMacintosh of
  the Star Flit medical corpse.  Affectionately known as\n\"the Bones\".\n\n.rb\nAaaaaayyyyyy.\n\n.je\nOur
  engineering officer, Mr. Spot, is not here right now.  We'll be\npicking him up
  later.  And I, of course, am Captain Jerk, at your\nservice.\n\n.pz\nThank you,
  Captain Jerk-at-your-service, but -\n\n.je\nThat's Jerk.\n\n.pz\nPardon?\n\n.je\nIt's
  not Jerk-at-your service, just \nJerk.\n\n.pd\nWell, if you say so; we'll just jerk
  if we need anything.\n\n.je\nNo, no. If you need anything, just call your orderly.\n\n.pz\nI
  thought you said to jerk.\n\n.je\nNo, I'm Jerk.\n\n.pd\nWe figured that out for
  ourselves.\n\n.pz\nCaptain, I think you had better see to our escort. I think you
  killed him.\n\n.aa ECM\nI'm not dead.\n\n.pd\nDon't argue.  She's a goddess, and
  she says you're dead.\n\n.aa ECM\nI'm getting better.\n\n.rb\nI've examined him
  and he's dead.\n\n.aa ECM\nI'm not.\n\n.rb\n(SPREADS HIS HANDS AND LOOKS AROUND,
  A LA FONZARELLI) Aaayy.\n(STOMPS ECM ONCE.) He's dead, Captain.\n\n.je\nWell, do
  something about him.  We can't have him messing up the floor.\n\n(BRASSIERRE STUFFS
  ECM INTO THE TANG CHUTE WITH MCINTOSH.)\n\n.aa ECM\nI'm not deeeeaaaaad. (DIES AWAY)\n\n.je\nWell,
  let's get going\n(JERK MOVES TO CHAIR WITH A BOOBY ON EITHER SIDE OF\nHIM.) What's
  our course?\n\n.to\nRight on, Captain.\n\n.je\nWhat's that, Ibsen?\n\n.to\nStraight
  ahead, sir; and that's Tolstoy, sir.\n\n.je\nWhatever, and change that to a right
  turn.\n\n.jo\nCorrection, Captain.  That will be six wrongs, Ensign.\n\n.je\nHuh?
  How do you get that?\n\n.jo\nIt's simple, sir.  If two wrongs don't make a right,
  then\nthey make a left.  If three lefts equals one right, then it is \nintuitively
  obvious that\nby applying the Forrest lemma on capitalistic letters\nsix wrongs
  make a right. Completely logical, sir.\n\n.je\nJock, why don't you go sharpen your
  ears?\n\n.jo\nSorry sir, the ear-sharpener is broken.\n\n.je\nI don't think I can
  take this any more.  This crew is getting on my\nnerves.  I wish I could drop tham
  off on the nearest planet and carry\non by myself.  There's only one problem.\n\n(WALKS
  TO THE FRONT OF THE STAGE.)\n\n.nf\n***************************************************\n***to
  the tune of \"I Don't Know How To Love Him\"***\n***************************************************\n.in
  +5\nI don't know how to fly this,\nHow it works, how to move it.\nIt's a ship, it's
  just a ship.\nAnd I've had so many ships before\nIn very many ways, it's just one
  more.\n\nShould I keep on course,\nShould I just drop out,\nThink I'll ask Dick
  Knight what it's all about.\nI never thought I'd get this far;\nWhat do I do now?\n\nI
  don't know how to fly this,\nWhat the heck, it won't matter\nI've got a crew, a
  not bad crew\nAnd they all know how; who told them?\nMaybe thay'll tell me; I hope
  they do.\nI hope they do\n\n.fi\n.in -5\n.to\nExcuse me, Keptain. I wish to report
  that I can't make that\ncourse change, sir.\n\n.je\nWhy not?\n\n.to\nYou didn't
  get the form signed by the Assistant Assistant Auxiliary\nUndersecretary to the
  Dean's Second-in-Command's Subordinate.\n\n.je\nBy the who?  Never mind.  Straight
  ahead.\n\n.su\nVroom, vroom.\n\n.je\nQuiet, Suru.\n\n.su\nPutputputputput ( LOOKS
  AROUND GRINNING ) Brrrrooooom, brrrroooooom,\nbrrrrroooooooom, putputputput.\n\n.je\nCool
  it, Suru.\n\n.su\nBr-r-r-r-r-r-mmm, br-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-mmm.\n\n.je\nStop it, Suru,
  or I'll break your scarf.\n\n.su\nYes, Captain, straight ahead sir.  ( A FEW SECONDS
  OF SILENCE.  \nTHEN IN ANGUISH.) Please don't break my scarf, sir!\n\n(HE STARTS
  TO CRY AS THE LIGHTS GO OUT.)\n\nfin\n"
