The sun in the meadow is summery warm   
The stag in the forest runs free
But gather together to greet the storm  
Tomorrow belongs to me. 


The Branch of the linden is leafy and green 
The Rhine gives its gold to the sea 
But somewhere a glory awaits unseen 
Tomorrow belongs to me. 


The Babe in the cradle is closing its eyes  
The Blossom embraces the bee
But somewhere a whisper of eyes arise   
Tomorrow belongs to me  


Oh Fatherland, Fatherland, show us a sign.  
Your children have waited to see.   
The sun will come out when the world is mine.   
Tomorrow belongs to me.
