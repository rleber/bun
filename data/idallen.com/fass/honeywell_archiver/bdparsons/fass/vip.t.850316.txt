Other Notes for Vice President  
.sp 
1) Must have Car (this job is impossible without one)   
.sp

without 
.ul 
them. ) 
.sp

Parties

.bf 
Summer Weekend  
.sp 
1) Find a suitable place for about 40-50 people camping.
(Provincial parks tend to frown upon large groups of people).   
Usually someone's backyard, chalet, relative's farm, or general piece of
land is fine.   
.sp 
2) ASAP inform the FASS company of the location, date and cost of the weekend.  
Ask for confirmation so you will know how many people to accomodate for.
.sp 
3) Tradition:  Arrivial is Friday evening, with setup and possible Campfire.
(arrange with owners/proprieters a place to have a fire and arrange for 
firewood).  
.sp

Meals   
.sp 
Saturday Breakfast. 
.sp 
People tend to get up around 8-9 am, sleeping in hot tents is difficult.
Things for breakfast: (strange combination that have had varied sucess  





in the past) Toast, Bacon, Eggs, French Toast, Pancakes, Pan Fried Potatoes,
Cold cereal, Peanut Butter, Jame, Honey, Butter.
.sp 
Use your imagination.  Whatever you choose make sure you have a way 
to cook it and the appropriate utensils.  Ie. grill, large frying pan, etc. 
Oven mitts tend to be useful when dealing with fires also.  
A clean-up crew should be conscripted as well as a cooking-crew.  You don't 
have you do all the work yourself.  
.sp 
Lunch   
.sp 
Hots dogs, cold meats (sandwiches, kaisers), Hamburgers.
.sp 
Whatever the choice, typically it's make your own.  Make sure again that you
have the appropriate confiments, (mustard, relish, ketchup, onions, lettuce 
tomatoes, cheese).  and the appropriate utensils for cooking and eating.
.sp 
Saturday Afternoon  
.sp 
Lunch Stuff is typically accessible, coolers are a necessity and ice,   
pop and 
.bf 
some beer   
is usually brought in by FASS, the pop is free and the Beer is sold.
People are encouraged to bring their own alcoholic beverages if desired.
Large coolers of juices / kool-aid / MacDonald's Orange Drink is
usually made available.  (McDonald's stuff should be reserved in advance)   





Carrot stickes, celery sticks.  Bring these along, people will generally
cut them if you have the utensils for them to use.  
Coffee and Tea is a necessity, not to mention a way to make them.   
.sp 
Supper  
.sp 
Things that have been tried in the past: Pig (suckling, whole roasted), 
Roast Beef and Chicken roasted, Spare Ribs, Baked Potatoes, Baked Corn, 
Salads (tossed, rice-based), Buns / Bread with Butter.  
.sp 
Make a choice, the main thing is to feed everyone.  Have a way to prepare   
the food and the utensils necessary for cooking, eating and serving.
ie.  Cookie sheets for cooked meats, large bowls for salads, knives to cut  
things with, spread, etc.  Not to mention, plates, forks, cups, spoons, 
knives, etc for people to use.  
.sp 
Other useful things:
.sp 
Extension cords, water hoses, wood cutting tools (if necessary),
arrange with owners for location of fire pit and wood supply.   
.sp 
Saturday evening is usually a campfire, general 
munchies, marshmellows, chips.etc.  
.sp 
A secret supply of sunburn ointments and insect repellant is usually good too.  
.sp 
Milk for coffee and tea, scrambled egs or french toast. 
.sp 









salt and pepper and other assorted spices, onion powder, garlic powder, 
cayenne.... 
.sp 
Some people will NOT have tents and expect you to have a solution for   
them.  Maybe a large tarped area.  Extra sleeping bags, extra tents...  
Ask around, or write it in the letter, and people will bring them.  
Lawn chairs are handy too.  Not to mention bottle and can openers.  
.sp 
Sunday breakfast and sunday lunch are variants on Saturdays.  I'm   
sure you've caught the drift.   
Everyone should help with clean-up.  Occassionaly left-overs are devoured   
for Supper on Sunday if people are still around.
.sp 
Confer with property owners as to the rules that they would like observed.  
For example, Peter Fraser, asks that people stay out of the barns and not   
enter the house proper. 
.sp 
Other things:  napkins, garbage bags, toilet paper *** arrange with owners  
about the washroom facilities.  It may become necessary to rent a   
port-a-pottie.  Don't assume that FASS has use of refrigerators, freezers   
or  
.bf 
anything    
except the land.
Dish clothes, dish pans, dish soap. 
.sp 
You may want to have everyone bring there own knife, fork and spoon.






(this has never been tried but it will cut the cost down of buying the  
plastic ones).  But you still need utensils for cutting and spreading things.   
And you'll need utensils for those who forget.  
.sp 
Arrange for a table of some sort to put the food on the you will be serving.
(we have used cement bricks with planks before).
.sp 
You will have to arrange sleeping.  Some people won't have tents or 
sleeping bags.  Ask about this in the letter.   
I believe the PAC will rent tents or loan them, as will several outfitters  
in the city, or perhaps other people have extra tents and sleeping bags.
.sp 
Perhaps a covered area, instead which could double as sleeping quarters and 
if it rains somewhere to be, and to keep the food from out of the sun.
