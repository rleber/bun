about the songs:
   the following songs, though at one time in the script, were not actually 
part of the final show (even though my favourite was in there...):  
1-4:031:s "COAL" "TANG-SPAM"
1-4:039:s "Our Hearth" "Our House"  
2-5:128:s "You Can't Do Anything" "Anything You Can Do" 
2-5:357:s "Sex & Drugs & Downhill Skis" "Sex & Drugs & Rock'n'roll" 
2-6:169:s "The Bonzo Cat In The Hat Comes Back" "The Rain In Spain" 
2-6:653:s "No Fun Like FASS Fun" "No Business Like Show Business"   
    
also, you missed the use of "Tang" in the AIA scene (2-4, i think)  
other than that, it looks okay to me...
