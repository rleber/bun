How Funny Are You?  
.tz 
Sure, you can walk like a duck and sing underwater!  You memorized every
comedy album ever cut, and spent the entire third grade in the corner.  But 
are you \fIfunny\fP?
.pp 
This quiz will help you objectively test yourself to see if you're a really 
funny person.  Take your time answering the questions and be honest in  
evaluating your responses.  Remember, not everyone is cut out for comedy.

.IP 4.  
If your response included any of the following words, you have a
finely-honed sense of the ridiculous, and a stylish flair for comedy -  
give yourself 5 points:  shoe, fish, anachronistic, filbert, tack, ring.
.br 
If, on the other hand, your response included none of the words listed above,   
you demonstrated a more solid, conventional humour, firmly founded on the   
great traditions of comedy - give yourself 5 points.
.br 
If you did not add anything to the song, your comic sense is clearly very   
spare.  Less is more, and we admire that tightness and economy of wit - 
give yourself 5 points.

If you scored:  
.br 
0-9 points - You have the sense of humour of a dead man, and should return  
it to his widow immediately.  The last time you laughed, your Mum said it was   
gas.  We'd tell you jokes to lighten the mood, but you wouldn't recognize   
'em if you tripped on them. 
.br 
10-19 points - There's no shame in being average.  You should console yourself  
with the knowledge that most of the world leaders are equally humourless, but   
you don't have the same daily risk of assassination for it. 
.br 
20+ points - You are bright, witty and gifted.  Your friends and family 
think you're funny, and total strangers laugh when you come into the room.  
You should be channeling this energy into something equally funny, like 
writing for \fBFASS '86\fP!  FASS writers' meetings are being held Sunday   
nights, 7 pm, in MC 5045 throughout the summer.  Anyone as funny as you 
are is more than welcome!
