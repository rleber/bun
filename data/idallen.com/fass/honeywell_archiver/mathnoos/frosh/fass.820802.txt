.hd"Welcome to F.A.S.S" 
.ph 
Greetings frosh and old-timers alike.  This fall term, you are invited  
to become involved with a group of people known as the F.A.S.S. Theatre 
Company.  F.A.S.S. stands for Faculty, Administration, Staff and Students,  
with students being the majority.  We exist for the sole purpose of partying,   
and creating and performing a wonderful musical farce comedy in the first   
week of every February.  Long before the show comes around, though, the 
writing committee meets throughout the fall term and creates a script.  
Then in January we have auditions and parties and rehearsals and more   
parties until finally we have a SHOW, which runs for four nights in the 
Humanities Theatre to often sell-out crowds. Money made from the shows  
is used to pay for the next year's parties and show, with surplus funds 
being used to buy various much-needed supplies and equipment for the
theatres on campus. 
.ph 
Interested in acting, singing, dancing, technical   
work, costumes, make-up, writing, telling jokes, and generally having   

a good time? Then drop by the FASS booth in the Campus Centre the first 
week of classes and chat with our representatives.  They can give you   
further details of what we do, and they will invite you to the Annual   
Meeting and Party later in September, where you will be formally    
introduced to our own particular form of craziness and humor.  Posters  
and notices in various campus papers will tell you when and where it    
will be held.  Also this fall, FASS will be sponsoring a coffeehouse,   
so keep your eyes open for news of this, too.  Hope to see you  
in September!
