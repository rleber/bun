***The Future: Buildings and Places and Things  


- only the 10th floor of the Arts Library remains above ground. 
  - during reading week, enough books are out that it comes up for air  
    briefly.

 tab- turn EL 101 into anoth

- turn EL 101 into another pool.
  - whoever heard of screen doors in a submarine?   
    - whoever heard of parachutes in a submarine?   


- cutbacks: WLU demoted or devalued into a high school. 


- if the Ring Road only had one side, it would cost less to plow.   
  - Ring Road turned into a Moebius Strip: "The Strip". 
  - resulting traffic jam called a Klein Bottleneck.
  - they argued about the change, but the discussion was definitely 
    one-sided.  


- no more replacing grass each spring.  
  - students just sow wild oats, and import their own grass.
  - making hay! 


- save energy: remove the other half of all the light fixtures. 
  - break 8 foot fluorescent tubes into 4 foot ones.


- cutbacks: PI gets devalued.   
  - devalued to "e", another irrational choice, but it seemed natural   
    at the time (or at least log-ical). 


- why isn't the CC in the centre of campus? 
  - glacier action moved it.
  - PRG put too much snow on one side, and it got bumped over.  


- Integrated Studies;   
  - Indifferent Studies 
  - finally unified by careful busing of students from other Universities.  



- the PRG smokestack is really supposed to be a flagpole which the  
  Engineers built according to their blueprints.
  - maybe it's a silo for NORAD?


- the first tunnel ever built by the Engineers is the walkway above 
  University Avenue.
  - the second one is the Chemistry-Biology link.   
  - the third one is the PRG smokestack.


- the Psychology Building was supposed to sink, but it didn't!  


- the Ridgid Tool gets melted down for tricycles
  - would you ride one? 
  - would any female ride one!  


- Ridgid Tool replaced by a rubber mallet.  
  - "the Flaccid Tool"  


- Inactive Towing, Overactive Towing
  - HyperActive Towing tows buildings as well as cars   
  - Reactive Towing tows Active Towing  
  - RetroActive Towing puts your car back where it was  
  - all three Towing companies arrive at your car at the same time, 
    hook on, and tear the thing to shreds. (see this on stage!) 
  - Active Towing and Smelting! 


- the Psychology Building was a disposal area for left over hallways from   
  other buildings.  


- the Math Building is the box which the Arts Library came in.  


- why do the clocks on the walls humm?  

  - they don't know the words.  
  - it takes effort to move the hour hand over the top  
  - they emit deadly radiation. 


- the PRG smokestack is really a metric flagpole, built by non-metric   
  Engineers.


- the quest for deadly Chevronite means someone was tunneling under the 
  Arts Library, which is why it is sinking. 


- North Campus gets made into a cemetary.   
  - this way we can have as many plots and sub-plots as we want!


- to cut costs, they built Village Three out of Ice.
  - the problem was, they had to get people to move in before it melted.
  - ads specified "no hot plates" in the rooms. 


- why aren't there more buildings up by Optometry?  
  - once they built optometry, the long-range planning committee suddenly   
    could see much better and cancelled the medical faculty.


- Optometry: zoom contact lenses.   
  - if your lenses keep falling out, use contact cement.


- Faculty of Acupuncture: uses Needles Hall, of course. 


- Gambling: rampant.
  - you need to get three oranges in a row to leave a parking lot.  
  - nickel and diming your way through University...


***Correspondence Courses   

m?  

- for the deaf  


- in a typical course, all you hear is chalk writing on a blackboard... 


- on Birth Control: 
  - first lecture: DON'T!   
  - second lecture: I TOLD YOU NOT TO!  
  - lecture three: a vacation in New York State.
  OR
  - Birth control is sort of like mixing Chemical A with Chemical B(*BOOM*) 


- every Correspondence Course has an explosion in it.   


- magnetic tape is too expensive: freeze-dry the prof and send him. 


- on Phys. Ed. and Yoga.
  - a tape of creaks and groans and bones snapping. 
  - you get stuck and have to turn the tape over with your tongue.  
  - you're completely stuck in a full lotus and it won't tell you how   
    to get out of it until the next lecture.  And there is a mail strike.   


- "This tape, and your degree, will self-destruct in 15-18 months." 


- Subliminal Advertising in the tapes:  
  - the 20 Greatest Lectures, only $8.98 ($7.10 Celcius, $6.40 in Nfld.).   
  - using an AM-style disc jockey at 600+ words per minute. 
  - the prof gets interrupted by his/her kid saying he/she only had 
    three cavities. 
  - musical interludes, with sponsors   

    - "...and now, before we conclude this exciting proof, here is a word   
      from our sponsor!"


- Bloopers on the tapes.
  - prof has wrong subject. 
  - the phone rings.
  - a burglar breaks in while the lecture is being dictated.
  - a chemistry prof mixes two things and blows himself silly.  
    - the tape arrives charred in a broken box...   
  - a mistress arrives and wants attention NOW. 
  - there is someone trapped in the University Mail Room, who has left  
    a secret message hoping someone will free him.  


- each tape has an advertisement for the next in the series at the end. 
  - "...will a divide B?  Is the greatest common denominator really 1?  
    Tune in next lecture, for the exciting conclusion to ..."   


- the tapes arrive via carrier pigeon.  
  - immunologists find a vaccine which eliminates the "carrier" pigeon. 


- the tape deck is too expensive, so a student writes in ball point ink 
  on the cassette tape itself!  


- the famous Chinese Fortune Cookie Tapes: take one after dinner.   


- we find the Nixon Lost Tapes. 


- the tape machine is run by bicycle-power. 
  - not too good for tapes on relaxation.
