222-DDDEEEXXXTTTEEERRR(111):   (OPENING BOOK)  The gospel according to Rant:
   And in that year terrible  things  shall  come  to  pass.
   Taxation  shall  be increased, a mighty comet will appear
   in the sky, Brian Mulroony shall be Prime  Minister.   In
   that  time,  let  him who understands these mysteries ap-
   proach the nexus of power, whereupon he shall gain  great
   wealth.  This is the word of the founder.

   more Units or we risk a margin call.

   Units! Recite the Objectionable Creed.   


16-UNITS(2):  (SCHOOLBOY RECITATION) I Rant based the Objec-
   tionable philosophy on the  counterintuitive  proposition














   that  if  everyone  acts  like  a mean, selfish, vicious,
   bastard, that is acts objectionably, the world will be  a
   happy  place.   We oppose any government regulation which
   might interfere with our right to act objectionably. 


111777-EEEAAARRRTTTHHHWWWOOORRRMMM(111):  Master?   


18-MASTER(5):  Yes, Earthworm?  


19-EARTHWORM(2):  In Rant's structure  of  an  objectionable
   society,  what  exists  to  prevent the concentration and
   misuse of economic power by an unscrupulous minority?


20-MASTER(6):  (WITH A LARGE AND VERY NASTY  GRIN)  Nothing!
   Absolutely Nothing!  


************************************************************
*****           The Objectionable Philosophy           *****
*****                  to the tune of                  *****

   When Rant received her inspiration   
   She conceived of a wondrous plan.
   A way to build a perfect nation, 
   A sort of political fantasy land.


   At last she thought I know for certain   
   How to insure efficiency.


   I soon lift up the government burden.
   Soon reduce bureaucracy. 


   But all that you'll receive from her freedoms,   
   Much to your chagrin and dismay, 
   Is a rather redundant set of reasons 
   Why you must do whatever we say. 


   Work at any factory  
   We'll own it 
   Buy your food at the grocery 
   We'll own it 
   If when you receive your pay,
   You'd like to store it away, 
   Visit your bank without delay,   
   We'll own it.


   We'll own every oil lease,   
   And we'll own all the politicians.   
   We'll control the local police,  
   And all the sporting competitions.

   Try to avoid us if you can,  
   It doesn't matter what you plan, 
   You can move to Afghanistan, 
   We'll own it.


   You'll be born at a hospital,
   We'll own it 
   Don't forget your funeral,   
   We'll run it 
   If you decide that you don't care,   
   And you refuse to pay your fare, 
   Don't you dare take a breath of air! 
   We'll own it.

************************************************************


   A curse, a curse on you, strangers and relatives,
   Hypocrites that you be.  
   When I was old and tired and lonely, 
   You were too busy to visit me.   
   But now you're all here while my death is only   
   A few hours old  
   I'm not even cold


   A curse, a curse on you, strangers and relatives,
   It's your turn to lament.
   So sure that you'd get your hands on my riches,  
   You won't inherit half a cent.   
   And I tell you now you bastards and bitches  
   You won't leave alive
   You will not survive 


   Weak fools and greedy wives, 
   You cannot escape from this murderous hive.  
   Call in the police, or call in detectives,   
   Boozers and loosers and mental defectives,
