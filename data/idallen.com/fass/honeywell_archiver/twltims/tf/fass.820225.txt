Application for Technical Director  
.sp 2   
.ti +5  
I would like to apply for the position of Technical Director in my third
year of F.A.S.S.  I believe that I am qualified to perform the duties   
required of the Technical Director, based on previous experience in F.A.S.S.
as a grip and as Assistant Stage Manager.   
I am (in case you are at all interested) 21 years of age and able to walk   
and chew gum at the same time.

I have had a fair amount of experience in the organization and running  
of various organisations:

In the Winter of 83 I will be a student in third year (sort of) integrated  
studies.  I will be taking four courses or less, and will thus have free
time to devote to F.A.S.S.   I will likely be on campus for 2 more years.

I have the abilities required of the Tech Director:  a familiarity with 
building theatrical thingies (from F.A.S.S. and elsewhere), the ability 
to have other people do things I would not have time for (and to make   
sure they get done), and the ability to ask knowledgeable people things 
which I do not know.
I know how to use telephones and whips.
