AGING ART COLLECTOR.
THERE IS A COUCH
WITH SOME PILLOWS ON IT,
A TABLE WITH SOME KNICKNACKS ON IT, 
A SMALL WOODEN CHAIR,   
AN IMPRESSIVE-LOOKING OLDER CHAIR, AND AN UGLY PAINTING HANGING CROOKED ON THE  
WALL.   
THERE ARE TWO DOORS, ONE THAT LEADS TO AN ENTRANCE HALL, AND ONE
LEADING TO THE REST OF THE HOUSE.

Good.

But Teddy, it was fifty feet long.  
.ch th  
It was just some kind of eel, that's all.   
.ch be  
But it stuck its head out of the water and roared.  
.ch th  
I didn't see it stick its head out of the water.
And that roar was probably just a passing car.  
.ch be  
But we're in the middle of nowhere... there aren't any cars around. 
.ch th  
Well, whatever it was it certainly wasn't a sea serpent.
.ch be

I told you not to call me Teddy.
As long as we're here, call me "Theodore".

All right.

"Theodore", let's just go home.

Don't be silly.

Why else would Mr. Bogwhittle invite us here when he's practically on his deathbed?

But he didn't say anything about it in his letter...
.ch th  
(PULLING OUT LETTER)
Not in so many words.  But he did say "...I'll have a pleasant suprise  
for you this weekend".  
Obviously he meant  
he was going to give us his collection. 
.ch be  
(STANDING)  
How could he afford to buy all that stuff, anyway?

I only went out with her for six months.

might change his mind about giving us his collection.   
.ch jo  
You mean he's gonna give away   
the whole kit 'n kaboodle?

According to his letter,
he has a "big surprise" set up.  He must mean he's giving   
away his collection.

And he's really gonna give it to us?

What do we need five million dollars for?   
We've got everything we need.  A nice farm, a few cows, lots of pigs,   d heand genuine 

and genuine indoor plumbing.

Yes, I know... what else could a girl want? 
Joe,
there are finer things in life...   
filet mignon, champagne, caviar...

What's caviar?

Fish eggs.

Fish eggs?  
What do we need fish eggs for?  We got real chickens out back.  
.ch lo  
Joe, don't you understand?  I'm tired of the farm, and the  
pigs, and the chickens. 
I want to get back to civilization, and soon.   
This art
collection could be our ticket to the good life.
.ch jo  
Gee, Lorraine, it sounds like you've got the money spent already.   
What if this Mr. Bogwhittle gives that art collection of his to 
somebody else?  
.ch lo  
There's nobody else he could give it to.  Except... well, there is  
Teddy, but he   
doesn't count.

Why not?

Because he's a man.

Yes, I showed you his picture in the yearbook.

No, Teddy wasn't much of an athlete.

them, young couples just starting out...

a good old fashioned Easter egg hunt.

The travelling life is no life for a sea serpent.

Well, a couple of years ago I was doing some fishing up in Scotland
