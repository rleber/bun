POPE :  
Do you know which Pope I am?  Neither does he. [INDICATES WAITER]. Most 
people can't count that high anyway.  That's why I always carry Vatican 
Express Traveller's Cheques.  If they're ever betrayed or   
foresaken, they can be resurrected -- usually by monday.  It' heavenly.

POPE :  
You're welcome.  Cross my heart [CROSSES HEART], it's great!  God knows what
I'd do without my Vatican Express Traveller's Cheques.  Don't leave Rome without
them.
