Bernie, Bernie, we pant after new members.  (Not literally  
of course, although sometimes the girls get a little
carried away at FASS parties).  Ahem.  If you are interested
in helping with the script, writing meetings take place 
every Tuesday night at 8:00 in the basement of Modern   
Languages, ML 104.  Loads and loads of fun.  If you are 
interested in working backstage, lights, sounds, props, 
etc. call Mike Grey at 885-1366 - he's in charge of tech
things and loves having people call him (he's frequently
not in).  If you are interested in acting, not very much
gets done until the script is ready, and so we run what are 
laughingly called auditions (no one has ever been turned down   
for a part yet) the first week in January.  There should    
be posters up when the time comes.  
  If you have any questions about anything, the president   
really is Tom something, Tom Hocaliuk on Erb Street West;   
I expect he's in the phone book, and the number of  
Hocaliuks is ssmall.
