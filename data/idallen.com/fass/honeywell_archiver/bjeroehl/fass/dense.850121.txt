(FLIGHT OF THE VALKYRIES)   
.xx ANNOUNCER   
And now, a brand new video game for your Safari computer.  You've   
played PAC-MAN, you've played Ms. PAC-MAN and you've played Baby PAC-MAN.   
But have you got what it takes for....  
.ce 
DENSE PAC-MAN!! 
Now we adds a new dimension to video games by combining 
TWO popular games, PAC-MAN and Missile Command, into one.   
In DENSE PAC-MAN, you get 100, count 'em, 100 Power Pills.  But!  They're   
all in one place.  And any attempt to use them blows up the video game. 
It's tough, but exciting.  Get DENSE PAC-MAN wherever land-based video  
games are sold.
