I'll have to start throwing around random ideas. I'm a great spy and
mystery lover. Oh, what a neat show. I mean, everyone, but everyone in the  
case could always walk around with a trench-coat and sunglasses. Always.
The gag line would be when one person shows up not in trench-coat. When 
asked about it, he replies "I'm going incognitto!" (sp?)
    
Oh, but what a number you could do on the myth of the spy-the-great-lover!  
  "Oh, he's not bad in bed, but wierd. He kept looking under the bed all
   night!" (Reword so "under the bed" is mentioned last).   
    
That's going to be some fun plot!

Yesterday upon the stair
I met a man who wasn't there.   
He wasn't there again today --  
I guess he's from the CIA...

Wonnerful when it's not crashing.   
By the way a few minutes ago someone was commenting about the slowness  
of the system and suggested that they hire a few more hamsters. 
His friend replied:  "Hamsters?  You mean this is a wheel time computer?"

Faster than two megahertz!  
More powerful than the LSI 11 instruction set!  
Able to leap 2 micrometre high AND gates in a single clock cycle!   
... 
Look! Up in the sky! Its a data path! Its a DMAREQ request! Its a   
64 bit arith/logic unit with 1 microsecond floating point divides!  
NO! ITS ZILOG-MAN!  
... 
[We continue our story with our heroes, Zilog-man and Robust,   
 clinging to life, waiting for the dynamic memory they are hiding   
 in to get refreshed...]
ROBUST: Holy Non Maskable Interrupts Zilog-man! That refresh signal 
   had better come quick or we could end up as a parity error!  
ZILOG-MAN: Yes, Robust. But luckily I brought my jumper wires!  
   Now if I can just swing this end over to the GROUND pin...THERE! 
   And this one to the NMI pin...Oh no! I touched the RESET pin!
   If I'm not mistaken, the operating system zeroes all of memory   
   after a RESET request! Oh my. We have about 17 milliseconds! 
    
      {Will our heroes bite the semiconductoral dust? Or will they  
       escape to once again battle their arch enemy, Power Surge?   
       For the answers to these and other questions, stay tuned next week...} -jan

Cannibal chiefs chew Camembert cheese   
 Cause chewing keeps them cheeky;   
Big fat Fred fixed fur to his head  
 Cause he thinks fur makes him freaky;  
Benjamin Bland and his Bugle Band   
 Blow the blues biweekly;   
How many pies can a porpoise poise  
 On purpose if she pleases?

Will my old car be retired  
When the old tires start to give?   
If a studhorse is desired   
Does he lose his will to live?  
And will Yonge Street be denuded
When John Sewell catches on?
Or am I just deluded
'Cause my qualudes are all gone?
