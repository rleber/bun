We asked Mrs. Wanda Ostlander which of these two holy communion wafers  
she preferred.  
.ch wo  
I think I like this one.  It's lighter, and leaves my soul feeling fresh
and clean.  
Also it tastes more like the body of Christ,
and the transubstantiation doesn't  
irritate my stomach like that other wafer.  
.ch ft  
Well, Mrs. Ostlander, you've just chosen (LIFTS COVER) Catholicism. 
.ch wo  
Oh my, we've always been Anglicans, but I guess next Sunday we'll be at 
Mass.   
.ch ft  
That's right, Mrs. Ostlander, more and more people are choosing Catholicism,
the only religion with the original sin.
