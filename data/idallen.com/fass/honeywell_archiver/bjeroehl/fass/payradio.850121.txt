Are you bored with the mindless, inane slop that you find on commercial 
radio?  Do you find AM vacuous, FM dull and shortwave hard to listen to?
Well, don't despair -- Pay Radio has arrived!

That's right, Pay Radio -- the airwave's answer to Pay TV.  We have it all--

and First Choice the success stories they are.
