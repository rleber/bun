.   
Twonce a night, I give them light   
And fried perspective croons;   
Without the hall she has a ball 
Disguised as brass spittoons.   


As yet we feel the old bonspiel 
Has never caught a fox. 
My drainpipe sings, but loathsome things
Secrete a cardboard box.


"Anticipate and demonstrate",   
The mother Chevy moans; 
A field of knives contracts the hives   
And freezes student loans.  


In quite this spot we poured a shot 
Of tittilating sponge   
An iron grate, deranged of late,
Apparent by a lunge.


The corn at hand struck up the band 
And parents grew their forks
A plug at ease has lost its fleas   
And mottles several corks.  


And then at last, and twice as fast 
As speeding hot pastrami,   
A tuneful sax undid its racks   
And warbled for its mommy.
