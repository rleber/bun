.ch Matt
Let's get out of here, please.  
.ch Announcer   
Welcome to the adventures of FASS WORLD, a shocking 
new adventure in a very strange place. We find ourselves walking
through a very odd kind of cave with two fantasy adventurers,   
Mona Nucleosis and Matt Burthews who are following their faithful   
leader and guide Count Backwards.   
Let's follow our friends as they proceed west through a gloomy  
passageway filled with eerie masks and spider-web covered paintings of jesters. 
.ch Voice   
You are now proceeding west through a gloomy passageway filled  
with eerie masks and spider-web covered paintings of jesters.   
A large poster on the wall says "Welcome to FASS
WORLD where life is a FASSing dream."   
.ch Mona
This place is really creepy Matt. I wish we hadn't come 
here.   
.ch Matt
Well Mona, it was your fantasy. 
.ch Mona
What do you mean, my fantasy? I thought it was your fantasy.
.ch Matt
Why would I fantasize about coming to a place like FASS WORLD?  
I've got better things to dream about. I'm an engineer, remember?   
.ch Mona
Well, if it wasn't your fantasy and it isn't my fantasy,
what are we doing here? 
.ch Matt
There must be some mistake. The Count must have got us mixed up 
with someone else.  
.ch Mona
Speaking of The Count,  
where has he gone?  
.ch Matt
I don't know. It's so dark in here I can't see my hand in front of your face.   
.ch Mona
Just a minute; I'll get the solar powered flashlight out
of your pocket. 
.ch Matt
There's no flashlight in my pocket. 
.ch Mona
Then what ... oh!   
.ch Matt
It doesn't matter. A solar powered flashlight wouldn't  
be much good down in this dungeon anyway.   
.ch Mona
That's true.
.ch Matt
Don't worry. I may not have a flashlight, but I do have 
an electric sundial.
I found it in a box back there labelled "FASSACRE 78".  
.ch Mona
But it's too dark here to see what time it is.  
.ch Matt
Oh, don't worry about that! 
This sundial has a night light. See?
.ch Mona
Look! There's The Count, just ahead of us. Count Backwards! 
.ch "Count Backwards"   

Ten, nine, eight, seven, .... Oh, sorry.  Hi kids.  
Are you two enjoying your little adventure? 
.ch Matt
That's what we want to talk to you about, Count.
I think there has been a little mistake.
.ch "Count Backwards"   
Mistake?
.ch Mona
Yes, this isn't the fantasy Matt and I asked for.   
.ch "Count Backwards"   
Of course not. It's my fantasy. 
.ch "Matt & Mona"   
What??  
.ch "Count Backwards"   
I brought you down to FASS WORLD so I could indulge in  
my favourite fantasy - watching people suffer at the mercy  
of old FASS jokes.  
.ch Matt
Hey, Count, that's not fair.
Let us out of here. 
.ch "Count Backwards"   
You can find your own way out if you are clever enough. 
.ch Matt
How do you ever expect us to be clever enough to get
out of a maze of twisty little passages like this?  
.ch Mona
Yeah, Matt's an Engineer and I'm in Arts.   
We wasted all of our undergrad years working with   
FASS and never got any education.   
(ELBOW FROM MATT)   
Sorry, I mean "never got no education". 
.ch "Count Backwards"   
That's why this fantasy of mine is particularly 
appropriate for you.
It's now your turn to suffer, just as your audiences have suffered  

through over a decade of obscure puns, oblique references, and  
ostentatious staging.   
.ch Matt
Count! Please! Anything but that!   
.ch Mona
I don't want to be trapped in FASS WORLD!   
.ch "Count Backwards"   
It is your only fitting destiny.
Have a nice time, kids. 
.ch Mona
Oh Matt! What are we going to do?   
.ch Matt
Try to get out, I guess.
.ch Mona
Which way should we go? 
.ch Matt
East. That's the way we came. I think...
.ch Voice   
You are now entering a large room filled with hordes of steaming little 
munchkins. Only visitors who have the name Eric will escape 
their massed attack.
.ch Matt
But our names are Matt and Mona. Neither of us are named
Eric.   
.ch Voice   
Too bad for you. In a second, thousands of knee-high munchkins  
will charge out of the shadows and apply the famous munchkin
death grip. 
.ch Mona
Run Matt!   
.ch Matt
Which way?  
.ch Mona
I don't know. East again.   
.ch Voice   
You are now entering a long narrow hallway. It is   
dimly lit, but on the floor you can see the stretched out,  
sleeping body of the Great Red Tundra Worm blocking your path.  
.ch Mona
What's a great red tundra worm? 
.ch Voice   
By speaking in such ignorance, you have awakened the
beast who has now coiled up into his characteristic position
which makes him resemble red dinosaur dung. 
.ch Matt
That reminds me of a joke, Mona; what's brown and rings like a bell?
.ch Mona
Not now, Matt!  
Do you think the worm is dangerous? 
.ch Preston 
No, no, not likely, no.  Yes! A bit, but not much.  
.ch Voice   
Of course the Tundra Worm is dangerous. Do you think we'd go to 
all the trouble and expense of moving him into the cave if  
he wasn't dangerous?
.ch Matt
I hadn't thought of that.   
.ch Mona
What will he do to us?  
.ch Voice   
You must get past the beast to escape. That wouldn't
be such a problem except that he is filled with high explosives 
and the least little thing will cause him to blow up and splatter   
you all over the walls of the cave. 
.ch Matt
That's terrible!
.ch Voice   
I'll say.   
Who do you think has to clean up the mess?  
Some people just got no respect for...  
.ch Mona
Matt, how will we ever get out? 
.ch Matt
Maybe we could convince him to leave.   
.ch Mona
How?
.ch Matt
Tell him jokes. That always works on our friends.   

.ch Mona
What friends?   
.ch Matt
See how well it works?  
Okay, worm; what's red  
and green and goes two hundred miles per hour?  
.ch Voice   
I'm sorry, but you have just made things worse. By  
using miles per hour instead of kilometers per hectagram, you have aroused  
the anger of the Sisters of Celcius.
The Sisters are armed with sharp wooden meter sticks which might well   
cut you to ribbons. 
Your only defence are some seven inch MathSoc rulers lying on the floor 
near one of Billy Gram's sermons.   
.ch Matt
If they attack, the worm will explode.  
.ch Mona
Oh, let me out of here. 
.ch Matt
Wait for me!
.ch Voice   
KAPOWIE! The tremor caused by Matt and Mona's escape
has caused the worm to explode and cover the walls with the 
Sisters of Celcius. 
.ch Matt
I can't see! I can't see!   
.ch Mona
Why not?
.ch Matt
I have my eyes closed.  
.ch Mona
That's just stupid! 
.ch Voice   
You are in a small room with staircases leading up on   
all sides. I'm not going to tell you what lurks at the top of   
any of them, but I will mention that Matt won't be able to get  
up the stairs if he carries that sundial. Besides, the batteries
in the night light are about to wear out.   
.ch Matt
I knew I should have brought my Mickey Mouse flashlight.
.ch Mona
Should we go up?
.ch Matt
It seems like the only way out. 
Quick, up these stairs. 
.ch Voice   
You have scrambled up a flight of stairs. Matt has  
dropped the sundial, as predicted, and it has shattered into
a million pieces.   
At the top of the stairs is a beautiful woman tied to a stake.  
.ch Woman   
Help! Help! Untie me from this terrible steak!  
.ch Matt
Why?
.ch Woman   
I'm a vegetarian!   
.ch Mona
Come on, Matt, let's try a different stairway.  
.ch Voice   
You have just come to the top of the next   
stairway. There is the distinct smell of seaweed and you can
feel the spray in the air. There is the sound of rhythmic clapping  
as Meanpeace sails their Trojan Whale into the cave.
.ch Matt
Meanpeace?  
.ch Mona
You remeber, Matt. They're the group who sails the world
in their Trojan Whale and beat people with seals.   
.ch Matt
Well at least we're safe. We don't have any seals.  
.ch Mona
I mean they hit people over the head with seals.
If we're not careful, they could seal our fate as well. 
.ch Matt
Why do they do it?  
.ch Mona
It's their contribution to the environment. 
.ch Matt
Oh. 
Hey, I just thought of something.   
.ch Mona
Are you okay? Was the strain too  much? 
.ch Matt
Don't be so stupid, Mona. I just thought, if
Meanpeace is sailing into the cave, we could get out the
same way they came in.  
.ch Mona
But we don't have a boat.   
.ch Matt
We could play like pirates and high jack the Trojan Whale.  
Now quit complaining and get ready to punch out these   
Meanpeacers when they arrive.   
.ch Mona
Look, there's the Trojan Whale. 
But there's only one
person on it.   
.ch Matt
And he's only got one hand. 
.ch Mona
What was all that clapping then?
.ch Matt
I guess what we heard was the sound of one hand clapping.   
.ch Meanpeacer  
Ahoy there. Get out of the way or I'll be forced
to hit you with my seal.
.ch Mona
We're not afraid of you.
.ch Matt
Speak for yourself, Mona. I'm scared to death.  
.ch Mona
We're going to take over that Trojan Whale and sail it  
out of here.
.ch Meanpeacer  
That's what you think. One quick swipe with my trusty   
seal and it will be curtains for both of you.   
.ch Matt
I think we ought to get out of here.
.ch Mona
We can win for sure. It's two against one.  
.ch Matt
That's right. I'm leaving, so it's you against him  
and that seal.  
.ch Mona
Matt! Come back! This is our only chance of escape. 
.ch Voice   
Don't feel badly Mona. I assure you, you wouldn't   
have won anyway. The next staircse has led the two of you into a room   
filled with gold and jewels. There is a door that has an exit   
sign above it and a window through which you can see the real   
world, or at least the University.  
The window is open. So is the door. You are free to 
gather all the riches that you want and leave if you hurry. 
.ch Matt
Look at this Mona! I can't believe it. We will be   
forever rich.   
.ch Mona
WOW!
.ch Voice   
You aren't fast enough. The cave is now closing. You
have until the gong sounds to escape or you will be trapped 
forever in the repository of FASS WORLD.
.ch Matt
Quick, take these rubies.   
.ch Mona
I haven't got any more pockets. 
.ch Matt
I can't move.   
.ch Mona
You're carrying too many things.
Drop something. 
.ch Matt
What happens if the gong sounds before we get out?  
.ch Mona
You heard him. It means we'll be trapped forever in 
the repository of FASS WORLD.   
.ch Matt
What does that mean?
.ch Mona
A repository is a place where you put things for storage.   
.ch Matt
No, I mean what does "forever" mean?
.ch Mona
Bloody Engineer.
.ch Voice   
GONG    POOF!   
.ch Matt
Where are we?   
.ch Mona
It looks like some kind of a stage props cupboard or something. 
It's full of all kinds of junk. 
.ch Voice   
This is the repository of FASS WORLD. You have not passed   
the test. This cave is really a maze that has been used for years   
on rats in the psychology department. In keeping with the lower 
standards of students being admitted to the University, we have 
replaced the English Language Proficiency test with this maze test. 
Ninety percent of rats tested, find their way out. So far, no student   
has. You had your chance. In punishment for submitting your audiences   
to pain and torture year after year, FASS WORLD has created the repository  
where you will be tortured forever with memories of FASS.   
.ch Matt
Please, anything but that!  
.ch Voice   
Sorry, but you deserve it. Bye. 
.ch Mona
There must be some way out. 
.ch Matt
Yes, there must be some way out.
.ch Mona
Look there's a dwarf over there, sleeping on the floor. 
Maybe he can tell us how to get out.
.ch Matt
There's a sign over his head. What does it say? 
.ch Mona
I don't know.   
.ch Matt
Maybe it's in German. I took German in first year, so   
I should be able to read it. Hmm, it doesn't look like German.  
.ch Mona
It's English, you dipstick! 
.ch Matt
How do you expect me to know. I'm an Engineer.  
What does it say?   
.ch Mona
I said it was English. I didn't 
say that I could read it.   
.ch Matt
If neither of us can read, how will we ever know what   
it says.
.ch Mona
Maybe we could wake up the dwarf and ask him what it says.  
.ch Matt
That's a great idea. You wake up the dwarf. 
.ch Mona
Why me? 
.ch Matt
Because you are the girl. Everyone knows that the beautiful 
girl kisses the dwarf and awakens him.  
.ch Mona
I thought that it was the other way around. 
.ch Matt
Details, details.   
.ch Mona
If I kiss him, he might get violent.
.ch Matt
Why?
.ch Mona
Well, with a name like Mona Nucliosis, no one wants 
to be near me. If I try to kiss the dwarf he might get mad and do   
something we'll regret. 
.ch Matt
Just kiss the dwarf, Mona. You don't have to introduce yourself,
so he'll never know your name.  
.ch Mona
I don't even kiss on the first date, let alone without an introduction. 
.ch Matt
Just wake up the dwarf. 
.ch Mona
All right. (SHE KISSES THE DWARF WHO JUMPS UP FROM BENEATH THE  
SIGN THAT SAYS "DO NOT WAKE UP THE DWARF OR YOU WILL BE SORRY" HE IS
NOT IN A VERY GOOD MOOD.)   
.ch Dwarf   
You're so ugly your mother had to tie a bone around your neck   
so the dog would play with you. 
.ch Mona
Ouch!   
I think he's going to try and kill us with insults! 
.ch Matt
Be thankful. They're easier to dodge than puns. 
.ch Dwarf   
You're so stupid that when your father wanted you to climb a
ladder, he had to put a stop sign at the top.   
.ch Matt
That one hit me. OHHH!  
.ch Mona
Matt!   
.ch Dwarf   
You're so ugly, your mother had to feed you with a slingshot.   
.ch Mona
Don't die Matt. Give me some ammunition. Tell me some puns I
can use.
.ch Matt
GASP!   
.ch Dwarf   
You're so stupid you think microscope is a mouthwash for midgets.
