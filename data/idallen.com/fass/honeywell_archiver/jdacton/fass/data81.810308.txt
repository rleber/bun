THINGS THE DIRECTOR WANTS TO KNOW   
.sp 
.fi 
FASS auditions are our way of helping the director find out both
what you want to do in the play and how much, so that we can assign you 
to a part that you can handle. We have acting, singing, dancing and 
technical parts of all lengths, styles and difficulties. We want to exploit 
your natural talents, so if you have something special that you can do, 
then let us know. We may need someone with your talent or may create
a spot to use it. (Last year we wrote in a gymnast.) If time is a problem,  
please don't stay out; just ask for a smaller part!
