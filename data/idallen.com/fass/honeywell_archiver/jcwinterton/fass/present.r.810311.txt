Opening Remarks.
FASS 1982 should have an Arabian Nights framework.  
.bl 
In addition to the extremely rich and well-known material which can be used,
it is easy to insert scenes and stories into the
general framework.  
.bl 
The basic framework consists of the Sultan's bedchamber.
Each night for the past several years, the Sultan has taken a maiden to 
wife, then had her executed in the morning so that she could never be   
unfaithful to him.  
There is getting to be a shortage of maidens in the kingdom.
At last the Grand Vizier's daughter, Sheherazade, convinces her father to   
give her in marriage to the Sultan. 
She has an idea and carries it out. 
.bl 
After the nuptual event, Sheherazade begins telling the Sultan a story, and 
leaves the ending hanging as the sun comes up.  
The Sultan is so intrigued with the tale that he commutes her death sentence
until the next morning so that he can hear the remainder of the tale.   
.bl 
And so it goes, for 1001 nights.
.bl 
By this time the Sultan has fallen in love with Sheherazade, and relents
his sentence.   
They live happily ever after.   
.tl 
How this Framwork can be Used.  
.bl 
The following is a set of ideas which could be used to establish the
framework.  
.sp 
The first scene could open with the Sultan and Sheherazade relaxing in bed  
after their exertions.  
In the book, Sheherazade has her kid sister along as a shill.   
This sister, Dunyazade, asks Sheherazade to recount the story of (for example), 
Little Salome, the never-been-had.  
The Sultan comments that it would be diverting to have a story and adds his 
plea to Dunyazade's.
At this point, the dialogue can go ..   
.bl 
.in +5  
"Hear, then, O FASSinator, the story of Salome of Bagdad, hight the 
never-been-had.  This tale has also been called, in the bazaar, Who Stole   
the Corks in the Vinegar Works? 
.sp 
"Upon a time, in the city of Bagdad, there lived the maiden Salome, who was the 
beloved of Ali of the Sterling Quality.  In that same city lived the ne'er do well  
landlord, Abu the Slimy. ..."   
.bl 
Fade out, and change set for the next scene, in this case, a melodrama. 
.bl 
The bedroom set can be placed upstage, and a drop or cyclorama could be 
brought down to cover it, and continue the scene in the downstage area. 
.bl 
From this point on, each scene can be introduced by a voice over of 
Sheherazade with words like...  
.bl 
.in +5  
"...and there is told in the bazaar, O defender of the people, of a marvellous  
adventure suffered by ...." 
.bl 
This kind of bridge can easily be used, and made as long as necessary, to   
change sets, drops, players or whatever is necessary.   
.bl 
.tl 
Stories from the Arabian Nights.
.bl 
Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves. 
.bl 
Anyone who eats out in the K-W area can easily see a parody here titled 
Ali Baba and his Forty Eateries.
.bl 
The Seven Voyages of Sinbad.
.bl 
There are seven connected stories about Sinbad the rich merchant who describes  
his adventures as a trader in the eastern Mediterranean.
Rather an overdose, and could be a separate plot in themselves, but at least
one could be used with a slight change to modern times and the oil shiekdoms.   
.bp 
Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp. 
.bl 
Another superb chance for a slap at scientists, engineers, D&D freaks, etc. 
.bl 
.tl 
Expansions. 
.bl 
Within this type of framework, it is possible to interpolate short or long  
scenes of any type. 
The great advantage to using this sort of background is continuity. 
It also takes the basic action off Campus, which is desireable for  
snapbacks which can be used to take the audience by surprise.   
.bl 
It will be up to the designers as to whether this framework should be played
in historical or modern context.
It could even be placed in some post-armageddon civilization.   
.bl 
The idea of continuity through framework has been used successfully by  
FASS in the past.   
The 1974 'trip through time' seems to call up fond memories.
.bl 
Another advantage of having a framework to hang transitions on is that  
anything can be introduced without a lot of contortions to get from 
one scene to another.   
The voice over can cover any transition, since we are telling a series of   
quite disconnected stories. 
.bl 
There are a lot of ideas on the 'want to do' list that are hard to  
justify as the plot for an entire FASS. 
However, with this set up, we can have as many scenes as we want, with  
any theme.  
This provides an opporturnity to reduce the length of our wish list, and
make room for some newer material next year.
.bl 
In order to make a two hour show, we will need to provide five to seven 
scenes in each act. 
This may seem a lot, but remember that some will be as short as a couple
of minutes, and may be merely mimes, with the voice over behind them.   
.bl 
It is important to remember that the Arabian Nights framework is there  
to provide continuity for a review-type show.   
The scenes need have nothing to do with the actual Arabian Nights'  
Entertainments, but I think we should do a couple of them just because of   
the opportunity to use ideas such as the Oil Shieks, and the Blue Eyed  
Arabs of the West, and so on... 
.bl 
.tl 
Conclusion. 
.bl 
In conclusion, I again remind you that this idea is a framework on which to 
hang as many action ideas as we can handle. 
With the continuity provided by Sheherazade, we can switch places, themes, and  
times without having to either go to a full blackout, or arrange awkward
transitions.
As one of the writers in FASS for 1982, I know it will ease the burden of   
figuring out a shift from one scene to the next.
.bl 
With the Humanities theatre, there are many more possiblilities than we 
had in the Theatre of the Arts. 
The additional technical equipment will also make this kind of show easier  
to handle.  
.bl 
It might even be possible to use the thrust area of the stage as the
setting for the harem, and just lower it out of the way between scenes. 
I have some serious reservations on this, however, since I have not 
heard this device in action.
It won't work if it is noisy or unsafe. 
.bl 
.bl 
Some may ask how we will be able to work in large production numbers.   
It may be relatively difficult, since the individual stories tend to be 
of the 'chamber players' variety.   
This is the challenge, vote for Sheherazade, and we will give you   
a peek behind the curtains of the harem!
