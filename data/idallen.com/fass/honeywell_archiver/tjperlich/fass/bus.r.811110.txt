             "Bussing"  
.sp 
.sp 
The scene is set in a bus, at approx. 4:30 p.m. on a Tuesday
afternoon just after classes have finished.  The three characters   
are first, a typical male, second year university student, possibly 
in Computer Science. The second character is a beautiful,   
voluptous female dressed accordingly.                       
The third character is a clean-cut, preppy-looking, male    
"Moonie" in his mid twenties.   
.sp 
As the scene opens, the female is sitting alone on a double 
seat.  There are other people lying on the floor as if dead.
A numerous amount of potatoes are scattered on the floor and
over the bodies.  Every dead person is clutching  a potato  
or has one somewhere on his person.

ENTER student carrying a binder finishing a bag of "Hostess"
      potato chips.  He appears confused as he oversteps the

GIRL: Negative.

the student takes another sweeping look at the bodies and potatoes  
as he crumples his now empty bag of chips, tosses it aside and  
proceeds to slide in close to the female on the seat.

GIRL: Do you participate in mass sub-urban transit frequently?  
.sp

addressed. He then stares at the girl with a short pause.

           but just one more thing, are you really a student?

GIRL: Could I interest you in a carbon-based, vegetable matter  
      orb? (presents a potato to student)   
.sp

STUDENT (pauses and looks once more at the dead bodies and  
         potatoes): Er, No thanks, I just ate a big bag of  
         carbon-based, vegetable matter orb chips.

GIRL (to Moonie): Would you like a carbon-based, vegetable  
       matter orb?  
.sp 
.ti +2  
MOONIE (politely): No thank you, but the Unification Fellowship of the          
         Christian Brotherhood is having a meeting tonight. We will 
         be showing "Rock 'n' Roll for Christ's Sake" starring  
         Adam and the Cain Raisers.  It would be nice if you could join 
         our family sister..... 
(lights fade as he continues pitch) 
         ....why don't you bring a friend.  Could I interest
         you in some literature?
