(WE OPEN ON THE ACME INTERROGATION AGENCY.  
THE PHONE IS RINGING.   
IT IS A PERSON WITH HIS ARM WRAPPED OVER HIS HEAD.) 
.ch ph  
Ring.  Ring.  Ring.  I said, Ring!

(ENTER BEAUREGARD.  HE TAKES THE PHONE ARM  
OFF ITS HEAD AND PUTS ITS FINGER IN HIS EAR.)   
.ch be  
Hello, Acme Interrogation Agency, Beauregard speaking.  
You'r sending over a couple of spies for us?
That's very nice of you, but I prefer Macintoshes.  
Oh, those kind of spies.  You want us to interrogate them.  
Break them down into moaning masses of mindlessness through 
a series of threats and physical acts designed to undermine 
their resistance and sanity, that sort of thing?
Sounds lovely.  Bring them right over.  
.ad 
(HE HANGS UP THE PHONE BRIEFLY, THEN PICKS IT UP AGAIN. 
HE DIALS ANOTHER NUMBER ON THE PHONE'S FACE.)   
.ch ph  
Beep-beep-beep-beep-beep-beep-beep. 
.ch be  
Hello, Stanislaus?  You'd better come down now, 
we've got customers due any minute.

(ENTER TWO BOY SCOUTS.) 
.ch bj  
Is this the Acme Interrogation Agency?  
.ch be  
Yes, this is the AIA.  What do you two munchkins want?  
.ch bf  
We aren't munchkins, we're cub scouts.  I'm Baden Full. 
.ch bj  
I'm Baden Japan.
.ch bf  
And we've come to help you torture people.  
.ch be  
Pardon? 
.ch bj  
We're after our Torture Infliction merit badge. 
It's a real pretty one. 
.ch bf  
It's got a little picture of a pair of thumbscrews on it.   
.ch be  
I wasn't aware that they gave out merit badges for torture. 
.ch bj  
They give out merit badges for everything.  
Industrial espionage... 
.ch bf  
Mass homicide...
.ch bj  
Creating disasters at sea...
.ch bf  
Eating trucks...
.ch bj  
Organizing fee hike strikes...  
.ch bf  
(SADLY)  We didn't get that one though -- something went
wrong.  
.ch bj  
Maybe we'll get it next year...now that we've had   
some experience organizing a postal strike. 
.ch bf  
But in the meantime, we'd really like to get our
Torture Infliction badge.   
.ch be  
I'm very sorry, but we've already got enough torturors  
around here.
.ch bf  
Pretty please.  
.ch bj  
Pretty please with glucose on it?   
.ch be  
I'm sorry.  We've got plenty of full-time sadists on staff. 
And this term we've even got a co-op torturor.  
.ch bj  
A co-op torturor.   
.ch be  
Yes, she's here to learn the ropes. 
.ch bj  
Oh poop!  I was really looking forward to earning   
that badge. 
.ch bf  
I'm so depressed I could beat up a little old lady. 
.ch bj  
I'm so depressed I could torture a little old lady.

Hey, yeah!

(THEY RUN OUT.  ALMOST IMMEDIATELY STANISLAUS   
ENTERS FROM THE OTHER DIRECTION.)   
.ch st  
Are the new customers here yet, Beauregard? 
.ch be  
Any minute now, Stanislaus. 
.ch st  
I can hardly wait to turn them into blithering blobs
of brainlessness.   
.ch be  
Shivering slobs of shamelessness.   
.ch st  
Withering wads of weightlessness.

(PAUSE OF ANTICIPATION) 
.ch be  
All those things, yeah. 
.ch st  
Who are we doing this interrogation for, anyway?
.ch be  
Some alien cat named Sophocles. 
.ad 
(ENTER SOPHOCLES WITH HAILEY AND SMEDLEY IN TOW.)   
.ch so  
All right, here we are at the Acme Interrogation Agency.
.ch hp  
They'll never make us talk. 
.ch sm  
Scream and moan maybe, but never talk.  
.ch hp  
We don't remember a thing.  We drank some   
Milk of Amnesia before we came here.
.ch so  
Shut up or I'll cream you.  
.ch hp  
Not cream, milk.
.ch so  
I know what you said; but "Shut up or I'll milk you"
sounds funny.   
.ch be  
I take it you're Sophocles. 
.ch so  
That's right.  And these are my prisoners,  
Hailey Phillips and Smedley Merkin. 
.ch st  
Merkin, huh?  Well, we'll soon have you singing.
.ch sm  
"And sometimes when we touch, the honesty's too much..."
.ch st  
Okay, it might take a little longer than I thought. 
.ch so  
All right, now listen.  I represent a group of  
invaders from the glorious planet Bonzo Cat.
.ch ph  
Meow, meow, meow.   
.ch so  
Thank you.  
.ch be  
Sounds like our phone is on the Fritz.  
.ch so  
Now, we're after a new secret weapon that will  
enable us to conquer earth, and these two spies 
know all about it.  I want you to get the secret
out of them, any way you can.   
.ch st  
What kind of secret weapon is it?   
.ch so  
We don't really know.  We've just been told that
it's something so mind-numbing that it can completely   
destroy the brains of vast gatherings of people.
.ch be  
Like statistics.
.ch st  
Or disco.   
.ch hp  
Don't talk to me about discos -- that's where this  
crummy cat took us prisoner.
.ch so  
Silence!  Now you interrogators, I want that information
out of them within one hour, or else.   
.ch be  
Or else what?   
.ch so  
Or else I'll carve you into kitty litter with   
one of our outer space heavy sabers.
.ch st  
Don't you mean light sabers?
.ch so  
Have you ever tried lugging one of those things around  
all day?
.ch hp  
I'd think you would get used to carrying them around
after a while.  
.ch sm  
Right.  In outer space, light sabers are a part of living.  
.ch so  
Laugh while you can, human.  Soon your earth will be
ground under the paw of the glorious invaders from the  
planet Bonzo Cat.   
.ch ph  
Meow, meow, meow.   
.ch so  
Thank you.  
.ch be  
(LOOKING AT PHONE)  Maybe it's a new kind of busy signal.   
.ch so  
And now it's time for me to go.  Miao, baby.
.ch be  
Have a mice day.
.ad 
(SOPHOCLES LEAVES)  
.ch st  
Well, let's get down to the interrogating, shall we Beauregard? 
.ch be  
I think we should call in our co-op torturor to work
on these two.   
.ch st  
Hildegarde?  Do you think she can handle it?
.ch be  
I have high regard for Hildegarde.  
.ch st  
I have low regard, Beauregard.  
.ch be  
Low regard for Hildegarde?  
.ch st  
More like no regard for Hildegarde, Beauregard. 
.ch hp  
Hey, show some regard for Beauregard.   
.ch sm  
Right.  If you have high regard for Beauregard but low  
regard for Hildegarde, show your regard for Beauregard and  
disregard your nil regard for Hildegarde.   
.ch st  
All right!  But I still regard young Hildegarde with
something less than high regard.
.ch ph  
Stop it!
.ad 
(A BRIEF SILENCE.)  
.ch hp  
Whew!  Saved by the Bell.   
.ch be  
Hildegarde!

(HILDEGARDE ENTERS.)
.ch hi  
Yes, Beauregard?
.ch be  
I want you to torture these two prisoners and get   ah. some information

some information out of them.   
.ch hi  
Right!  Are these good guys or bad guys?
.ch be  
Well, how are any of us to judge really?
I mean, good and bad are such indefinable terms,
aren't they, subject to constant cultural bias and...   
.ad 
(STANISLAUS CLAPS HIS HAND OVER BEAUREGARD'S MOUTH.)
.ch st  
I've always said it's a mistake to let a mathie 
take a philosophy elective. 
.ch hp  
We're really good guys.  Does that make a difference?   
.ch hi  
Of course.  You see, good guys and noble types like that
are always capable of withstanding great physical torture   
themselves, but they crumple when they see fellow human 
beings in pain. 
.ch sm  
Really? 
.ch hi  
It's a well-known fact.  I could torture you with the most fiendish 
agonies for days and you wouldn't tell us a thing.  
.ch sm  
I wouldn't? 
.ch hi  
No.  But you'll break almost instantly when you 
realize that your silence is going to cause someone 
else to suffer.  One last chance.  Are you going to talk?   
.ch hp  
No! 
.ch hi  
Okay, I'll have to get rough.   
(SHE PUNCHES HERSELF IN THE STOMACH.)   
Take that.  Not enough, eh?  All right then.
(SHE PUNCHES HERSELF AGAIN.  WHEN SMEDLEY AND   
HAILEY SAY NOTHING, HILDEGARDE SLAPS HERSELF
TWICE ON THE FACE.) 
I can keep this up all day, you know.   
(SHE TORTURES HERSELF FOR FIFTEEN MORE SECONDS, 
PULLING HER HAIR, KICKING HERSELF, AND OTHER
CREATIVE MANEUVERS.)
How can you let this suffering continue?
.ch be  
I'm beginning to have low regard for Hildegarde,
Stanislaus. 
.ch hi  
All right, you two do-gooders, you asked for this!  
.ad 
(SHE PULLS OUT A GUN AND SHOOTS HERSELF.  SHE FALLS 
TO THE FLOOR.)  
.ch sm  
Jeez, and I was just beginning to crack.
.ch st  
Enough of this lolly-gagging around!  It's time 
we got down to some serious mayhem. 
.ch be  
Shall I bring out the thumbscrews?  
(HE MAKES AN OBSCENE GESTURE WITH HIS THUMB.)   
.ch st  
No,. I think we'll start off with some ugly threats.
.ch hp  
You can't scare us. 
.ch sm  
Speak for yourself, Hailey. 
.ch hp  
Smedley, we can resist them together.   
.ch sm  
We can? 
.ch hp  
Sure.  Pain and death can't scare either of us.
