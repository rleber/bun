(LIGHTS COME UP ON THE CASTLE DUNGEON COMPLETE WITH RACK, IRON MAIDENS, ETC.
THERE IS AN OPEN FIRE TO ONE SIDE OF THE STAGE WITH A SPIT. 
THERE ARE SOME CELL DOORS AT THE BACK OF THE STAGE. 
OVER THE DOORS IS A LARGE 'SHERIFF FOR SHERIFF CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS' BANNER.   
AS THE LIGHTS COME UP THERE IS A SCREAM OF ABSOLUTE TERROR. 
THE SHERIFF AND HIS AIDE ENTER FROM ONE OF THE CELLS.)  
.ch sh  
These afternoon torture sessions really make my day.
Who's next? 
.ch ai  
Your chef, sir. 
(THE SHERIFF LOOKS PUZZLED) 
The one who served you Village food.
.ch sh  
Right, tie him up to the spit and let him simmer for a while.   
.ad 
(SOME JAILERS BRING IN THE CHEF AND TIE HIM TO THE SPIT AND START TURNING IT.   
IF POSSIBLE THE CHEF SHOULD TURN REDDER DURING THE SCENE.)  
.ch ai  
(CHECKING HIS AGENDA)   
Sir, Robin Hood and his Green Party are becoming very popular in
the forest, especially since your wife joined them. 
The people love her.
.ch sh  
Yes, robbing from the rich and giving to the poor is a good platform.   
.ch ai  
The polls say you may lose the election with a fair vote.   
.ch sh  
Who said anything about a fair vote?
I have a plan.  
.ch ai  
Sir?
.ch sh  
How have all the great gangsters been caught in the end?
.ch ai  
(THINKING)  
Income Tax Evasion! 
.ch sh  
All we have to do is have him audited before the election.  
One bad deduction and it's off with his head.   
.ch ai  
But no one knows where his hide-out is in the forest.   
.ad 
(A GUARD RUNS IN, OBVIOUSLY EXCITED)
.ch g1  
Sir, we've just captured your wife. 
.ch sh  
Great, I'll teach her to run away from a loving husband.
Bring her here. 
.ad 
(THE GUARD EXITS.)  
.ex 
Why did she leave me?   al eI gave her everythin

I gave her everything she could possibly want; money, jewelry, ME.  
.ad 
(THE AIDE LOOKS AT THE CHEF WHOM THE TWO JAILERS
HAVE BEEN FAITHFULLY ROASTING.) 
.ch ai  
Do you think he's done? 
.ch sh  
Oh baste him and give him a few more minutes.   
.ad 
(A JAILER GOES AND GETS A SPICE WAGON AND STARTS SEASONING THE CHEF.
AN APPLE IS PLACED IN THE CHEF'S MOUTH. 
TWO GUARDS BRING IN MARIAN WHO IS KICKING AND SCRATCHING HIM.   
MARIAN IS WEARING A 'ROBIN FOR SHERIFF' BUTTON. 
THE GUARDS ARE, OF COURSE, WEARING A 'SHERIFF FOR SHERIFF' BUTTON.) 
.ex 
Ah, my darling wife, how good of you to come home.  
The children miss you so.   
.ch mm  
Dragged home more like it.  
And I sure didn't miss those brats. 
The're growing up to be just like their father. 
But I won't be here long -- Robin will save me. 
.ch sh  
What do you see in that insane fellow?  
.ch mm  
He worries about the trees and animals. 
He cares about people.  
He's against nuclear power. 
Besides he looks sexy in those tights.  
.ch sh  
I don't beleive it. 
The daughter of an Earl, a member of the nobility of the
country, degrading herself by living with commoners, and liking it. 
.ch mm  
But it is the common people who are the backbone of the nation. 
It is they who will make England a great nation for all time and Robin  
cares about them.   
.ch sh  
The only thing Robin cares about is replacing me as Sheriff.
.ch mm  
You'll never understand him.
.ch sh  
Oh but I do understand him. 
I started out just like him.
I once cared for the people but power corrupts. 
Tell me where he hides out, woman.  
.ch mm  
Never.  
.ch sh  
Put her on the rack.
.ad 
(ONE GUARD DOES SO AND STARTS TO TURN ONE WHEEL.)   
.ex 
Tell the auditors to get ready. 
I'll know where they are going soon.
.ad 
(THE OTHER GUARD LEAVES.)   
.ch ai  
That's your wife you're torturing.  
.ch sh  
Isn't it fun?   
.ad 
(THE GUARD STOPS AT THE FIRST CRACK OF THE SPINE.   
MARIAN SCREAMS.)
.ex 
Your precious Robin won't show up until long after this place   
is a tourist trap.  
.ld 
(ALL ACTION ON STAGE STOPS. 
A BORED SOUNDING TOUR GUIDE ENTERS FROM THE SIDE OF THE STAGE.  
BEHIND ARE A NUMBER OF OBNOXIOUS AMERICAN TOURISTS.)
.ch tg  
Here we have the Dungeon.   
Rumour has it that the Sheriff of Nottingham tortured Maid Marian here  
before she was rescued by Robin Hood and his Merry Men in 1186. 
Please follow me to the kitchen...  
.ad 
(THE TOUR GUIDE LEAVES. 
AS THE TOURISTS START TAKING PICTURES OF THE 'WAX FIGURES' IT BECOMES   
OBVIOUS THAT ROBIN AND THE MERRY MEN ARE AT THE BACK OF THE GROUP.  
THEY ARE DRESSED IN GREEN EXCEPT FOR WILL WHO IS IN RED.)   
.ch ma  
Oh, Bill.   
I saw the perfect gift for Jimmy; a 'My parents went
to Nottingham and all I got was this lousy shirt' shirt.
.ch ha  
These look realer than the ones we saw at Mme. Tussauds.
(HE PULLS AT THE SHERIFFS HAIR.  NO REACTION.)  
Feels like real hair.   
.ch bi  
How'd you like to take that one home?   
.ad 
(BILL IS POINTING AT MARIAN.
MAUDE (HIS WIFE) HITS HIM WITH HER PURSE.   
AGNES AND EDITH ARE AT THE RACK.)   
.ch ag  
I wonder if these are any good for back pains?  
.ch ed  
Well Ethel had one and she said it did wonders...   
.ad 
(BILL, HAROLD, AGNES, AND EDITH LEAVE.) 
.ch ma  
(TO ROBIN)  
I don't remember seeing you on the bus before.  
.ch rh  
We just joined the tour today.  
.ch ma  
Where are you from, San Francisco?  
.ch rh  
No, we're ballet dancers on a cultural exchange from Moscow.

.ch ma  
You certainly do look sexy in those tights. 
Dressing up for your girl?  
.ch rh  
(BLUSHING) Well... um... yes.   
.ch ma  
When's the wedding? 
.ch rh  
Right after we leave here.  
.ch ma  
Is she here?
.ad 
(ALAN APPROACHES.)  
.ch al  
Why don't you rejoin the tour?  
We want to take some pictures here. 
.ad 
(MAUDE LEAVES.) 
.ch rh  
I thought she'd never leave.
.ld 
(THE FIGURES ONSTAGE UNFREEZE.) 
.ch mm  
Robin!!!
.ch sh  
How did you get in? 
.ch rh  
That doesn't matter.
I'm here to rescue Marian.  
.ad 
(INSERT SONG HERE to be sung by the Merry Men (Production number)   
ACTUALLY I DO HAVE A TUNE IN MIND:) 
.sb "Green Robin Hood" "Sweet Georgia Brown"
.ad 
(WOULD YOU BELEIVE THAT THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY DOES NOT HAVE A COPY 
OF THE LYRICS OF SWEET GEORGIA BROWN'?  I LOOKED.   
I CAN TELL YOU IT WAS INTRODUCED BY BEN BERNIE AND HIS BAND IN 1925.
IT WAS SUNG IN THE 1957 MOVIE 'THE HELEN MORGAN STORY', AND WAS PLAYED IN THE   
1959 MOVIE 'SOME LIKE IT HOT'.  
ONE BOOK GAVE ME THE FIRST LINE OF MUSIC.   
SO I USED FASS 84'S VERSION OF THE METRE, BUT THEY DIDN'T   vingDO THE ENTIRE SONG SO YOU'RE ONLY GETTING BITS AND P

DO THE ENTIRE SONG SO YOU'RE ONLY GETTING BITS AND PIECES.  
(NOT ONE BOOK MENTIONED THAT IT WAS THE HARLEM GLOBETROTTERS THEME))
.ve 6   
God's green Earth is made for us and Maid Marian.   
God's green world is good to us and Maid Marian.
Clean air, Green plants.
For the birds and bees and ants,
And the doll who's got it all:  
Maid Marian.
.ve 1   
Sherwood named him, Sherwood claimed him, Green Robin Hood. 
.ad 
(DURING THE SONG, THE MERRY MEN WILL START UP A 'MAGIC CIRCLE' A LA 
HARLEM GLOBETROTTERS WITH A GLOBE.) 
.ch rh  
Release Marian you swine.   
I need her at my side if I am to to get enough vo... to win the elec... to  
live happily ever after.
.ch sh  
See, he's just as callous as I am, only he tries to hide it.
.ch mm  
(TRYING TO CONVINCE HERSELF)
No, Robin is faithful to the ideals of the Green Party. 
.ch sh  
(POINTING TO WILL)  
But they're REDS, Communists all of them.   
Mix their green and red with your blueblood and there's no telling what 
colour will come out.   
.ch mm  
Is it true, Robin?  
You only want me for the votes I will bring?
You don't love me?  
.ch rh  
Well... um...   
.ch mm  
Oh, Robin you are a disgusting pig, a ... politician.   
.ad 
(THE SHERIFF SMILES KNOWING THAT HE HAS, IF NOT REGAINED HIS WIFE, AT LEAST 
TAKEN HER FROM ROBIN.   
HE MOTIONS TO THE JAILERS AND GUARD TO CAPTURE ROBIN.   
THEY CONTINUE COOKING AND BASTING THE CHEF.)
.ad 
(INSERT SONG HERE, Marian's Lament)

(THE SHERIFF FINALLY GIVES UP ON HIS JAILERS AND CALLS FOR MORE GUARDS.)
.ch sh  
Guards!!
.ad 
(THE GUARDS COME AND CHASE ROBIN AND HIS MEN OUT OF THE DUNGEON.
THE SHERIFF RELEASES A SHATTERED MARIAN FROM THE RACK.) 
.ex 
(TENDERLY) Now, Marian, tell me where does Robin hide in the forest?
.ch mm  
In the clearing near the river. 
.ch sh  
Aide, send a party of armed auditors to the clearing.   
.ch ai  
Yes, Sir.
