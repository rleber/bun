(LIGHTS UP ON A CLEARING IN THE FOREST. GASTON AND RENEE, A WAITER AND WAITRESS ARE THERE. ENTER FRANCOIS, A CHEF.) 
.ch cr  
Bon jour, Francois. Did you find the way to the Sheriff's castle?   
.ch cf  
No. We must find it if we are going to cater his banquet. Has Fifi come back yet?   
.ch cg  
No. Neither has Armand. 
.ch cf  
If you are implying that they are together, I laugh at that. (HE LAUGHS) Fifi is totally faithful to me.
.ch cr  
Oh, really? 
.ch cf  
All right--one.  She's had one affair.  
.ch cg  
One?
.ch cf  
Ten.  She's had ten affairs. Fifteen at the most.  Maybe twenty.
.ad 
(THEY WAIT A SECOND)
.ex 
A year.  Twenty a year. But I want you to know that I am not taking this lying down.
.ch cr  
Fifi is.
.ch cf  
I challenged her last lover to a duel to the death. 
.ch cg  
Who won?
.ch cf  
Moi, of course. 
.ch cr  
By default. He didn't tell the other man where it was.  
.ad 
(ENTER FIFI AND ARMAND, BOTH CATERERS, BOTH DISHEVELLED)
.ch fi  
Francois! I am sorry we are late, but Armand's horse broke down and we had to spend the night in the forest. You do believe me, don't you?  
.ch cr  
His 
.ul 
horse   
broke down? 
.ch ca  
A hoof went flat.   
.ch fi  
We had to wait all night for someone with a foot pump.  
.ch ca  
I hope you don't mind.  
.ch cf  
Mind? Why should I mind if you are the latest in a seemingly endless stream of my wife's lovers?
Why should I mind that Fifi prefers great hulking apes with the mental capacities of trees? 
.ad 
(WITH AN INARTICULATE CRY OF RAGE ARMAND GRABS FRANCOIS)
.ch cf  
I hope you didn't take that personally, big fella.

(ENTER ROBIN HOOD, LITTLE JOHN, FRIAR TUCK, ALAN-A-DALE AND WILL SCARLET)   
.ch rh  
We have to find a way into the castle to rescue Marian. 
.ch ft  
It's too risky. The place is loaded with guards.
.ch cf  
No, really, Armand, I would love to fight you--to the death. But I think we are 
forced to set aside our personal differences until we find the way to the castle.   
.ch cg  
Look. Maybe these people know the way to the castle.
.ch cf  
Thanks, Gaston. It's too bad that we are French and they are English. We do not 
speak the same language; they will not understand us.   
.ch cr  
Fortunately, I speak the English language.  
.ch cf  
I'm gonna die.  
.ad 
(RENEE GOES OVER TO ROBIN & CO. AND SPEAKS TO THEM IN AN INCREDIBLY EXAGGERATED 
ENGLISH ACCENT.)
.ch cr  
Cheerio, hello, what-ho. I say, smashing good day, isn't it? Better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick, eh what? 
.ad 
(ROBIN LOOKS AT LITTLE JOHN. LITTLE JOHN TWIRLS A FOREFINGER NEXT TO HIS TEMPLE.)   
.ex 
We're lost, don't you know. Bit of astray and all that. Not quite got our bearings, you understand  
. Eh, eh, eh what, eh?  
.ch ft  
Where are you trying to go? 
.ch cr  
Go? Go? Why--to the castle. The palace, citadel, hold, keep, all of that.   
We are caterers, here to "do up", as you English say, the wedding of the Sheriff
of Nottingham to some young maiden. Dame. Broad. Tart. Piece of.... 
.ch rh  
I know what you mean. (SNAPS HIS FINGERS) I think I've found us a way into the castle.  
(TO CATERERS) Why don't you just follow us?

.ch mm  
You loathesome slug. You despicable slime-dwelling parasite.... 
.ch sn  
(ELMER FUDD VOICE) Quiet! This is just my job. Do you think I would muwdew, wape and piwwage if I didn't
.ul 
have
to? 
.ch mm  
Yes.
.ch sn  
Cowwect. But enough small talk. No doubt you want to know what my nefawious pwan
is? 
.ch mm  
No. 
.ch sn  
It's a weawwy good pwan.
.ch mm  
Whom did you steal it from? 
.ch sn  
It's all a twap for Wobin.  
.ch mm  
The old "Use Marian as Bait for Robin" trick. That's the fourth time this year. 
Let's save time; I'll escape now!   
.ch sn  
On our wedding day? 
.ch mm  
Our what?   
.ch sn  
You and I are getting married, my dawwing Mawian.   
.ad 

(MARIAN LAUGHS) 
.ex 
I am quite sewious. This will bwing Wobin to me.
.ch mm  
And what makes you think I'll co-operate?   
.ch sn  
I'd like you to meet: Cassandwa!
.sd 
(THUNDER AND LIGHTNING. ENTER CASSANDRA)
.ch cs  
You called me, shorty?

No, I called you Cassandwa.

Sawed-off two-bit vile dung-eating son of a syphilitic whore!   
.ch cs  
That's it.  
.ch sn  
Guards, gag Mawian. 
.ch g1  
I know a man with a wooden leg named Smith. 
.ch g2  
What's the name of his other leg?   
.ch mm  
(LOWER VOLUME) You rodent! You worm! You engineer!  
.ch g1  
Why was Helen Keller's leg yellow?  
.ch g2  
Her dog is blind, too.  
.ch mm  
(WHISPER)   
I'll get you for this....   
.ch g1  
What do you call a guy who turns into a building when there's a full moon?  
.ch g2  
A warehouse?
.ad 
(MARIAN OPENS HER MOUTH, BUT NO SOUND COMES OUT)
.ch cs  
I can't make Marian love you. But I can put in a new personality, one that might love you.  
.ch sn  
How much would it cost? 
.ch cs  
Twenty-five gold pieces.
.ch sn  
Too much.   
.ch cs  
Look, shorty:   
.ch sn  
Don't call me that! 
.ch cs  
Look, stupid: I can use a cheaper spell, but there will be side effects. Any little sound could cause her personality to change again.  
.ch sn  
I'll be quiet.  
.ch cs  
Not only that, I can't guarantee that the new personality won't break down. You 
could end up with twenty or twenty-five personalities all sharing her body. 
.ch sn  
Just so wong as I get to shawe her body.
.ch cs  
You're a sick man.  
.ch sn  
I know.

Mawian? How do you feel?
.ch mm  
This room is going to have to be redone! First we'll change those tapestries
for something a little less--   
.ul 
kitsch. 
Then, I think, new furniture.   
.ch cs  
(TO AUDIENCE) Isn't it disgusting what we'll to do people for money?
.ch mm  
You will get me new furniture, won't you, Notty-wotty? Because if you don't,
I'll be ever so cross with you. No more snuggle-bunny.  
.ch cs  
Pay me. Before I vomit. 
.ch sn  
All wight. I'll have someone take you to the tweasuwy, Cassandwa.
