.hd 'I SHERWOOD LIKE TO GET OUT OF HERE -- Charles' 
The first little bit goes on a bit long without laughs. 
I would do a bit more with the "icky gooey moat" to begin with...although   
giving Will some sort of extreme voice peculiarity might be enough to get   
laughs when he says the line.   
.bt 
The Friar Tuck character bit on the first page is weak. 
I think you have to do something different or cut it all together.  
Even though Tuck is eating as he talks, what they are doing is talking  
about something offstage, and I think you need something more immediate 
for it to work. 
.bt 
The synchronizing watches is good and funny.
The "watches haven't been invented yet" ending is a bit of a letdown.   
.bt 
I like the pecking order thing between the guards.  
.bt 
Maybe make the parking lot thing bigger.
It comes and goes fairly quickly, and more elaboration might be a good idea.
A possible pun on Camelot?  
.bt 
When Robin and his men enter Marian's room, the first three lines are sort  
of dead -- again, you're establishing Tuck's character by offstage stuff

more than onstage.  
.bt 
I think Robin should be the one doing the "horrible well-decorated" lines   
that Will does on page 3.   
You want to give Robin a chance to get suspicious of Marian (I think).  
Also, you may want to play with this some more. 
Robin gets a little jealous but that disappears almost instantly.   
You may well get a lot of mileage out of the jealousy thing.
.bt 
Castle Piercing Arrow suggests the name "Pierce Arrow" to me, a type of car.
Since you're using it as a vehicle, you might be able to work this in   
somehow.
.bt 
The "hollow shaft" business doesn't do much for me. 
I think you might go directly somehow to the Tiny John business which is
good.   
You might also want to take things to extremes here, like calling him   
Itty-bitty Teeny-Weeny John.
Just a thought...   
I don't think Marian's line "He moves around a lot?" is necessary -- the
audience will get the joke from listing the three counties. 
.bt 
The Green Acres song is good and sets up Marian's reaction very nicely. 
The rest of the scene ticks along well with good pacing for the most part.  
Will's line, "Look it's the Sheriff and his Buffoons" feels as if it chashould be funny, but I don't

should be funny, but I don't know if it really will be. 
Writing out the ticket is nice. 
You may want to make more of it.
.bt 
Jumping out the window into the moat reminds me of the "jumping off the 
cliff" scene in Butch Cassidy.  
I think the merry men may want to make more of a fuss as they go out,   
especially Will who objected to it in the first place.  
.bt 
The ending could need more. 
Maybe the guards throw the Sheriff out? 
Or the Sheriff goes out accidentally somehow?   
.bt 
Overall, a little slow in parts until it gets wound up at the end.  
You have some good starts to the characters, but I think you can make them  
more extreme in places and make things more lively. 
Don't just have them talk like extremes, have them  
.ul 
behave  
like extremes.  
.sq 
.bp 
.hd 'A TEARFUL REUNION -- James Nicoll' 
I don't know why you were worried about your scene, James.  
It's one of the best handed in. 
.bt 
Making the Sheriff a woman is a nice touch which gets you good mileage  
throughout the scene.   
.bt 
The whole first scene goes very nicely, as does the journalistic hacks  
piece.  SherI could quibble about the wording of some lines, but that's for late

I could quibble about the wording of some lines, but that's for later.  
.bt 
Try writing the satirical song about modern journalistic standards, or get  
someone to help you write it.   
In fact, try writing all the songs you've noted.
In the end, I suspect that you will only want to keep one or two, since 
four (?) songs in a scene is a bit much; however, it's well worth your  
while to "expand your repertoire" to learn how to write songs as well as
you write scenes.   
.bt 
The "beheaded" line after the song is pretty obscure...yes, I know about
cockroaches, but I think a different insult would work better.  
.bt 
The rabbit business is a good idea. 
I think you should work on the explanation a little better...maybe have 
the rabbit eat a part of the castle while the Sheriff talks (good technical 
effects).   
Also the explanation of where they got the giant rabbits is a downer.   
I'd come up with something different or expand the growth hormone thing 
somehow.
.bt 
I worry about the Sheriff's explanation of the lobotomy (bottom of  
page 4).
Lobotomies are stomach-wrenching things, and talking about drool makes them 
a little too real for comfort.  e liBe a little lighter-hand

Be a little lighter-handed here.
.bt 
The alimony revelation is big.  
Both Marian and the Sheriff should make more of it. 
After the alimony revelation, I think you should have a line or two about   
the former marriage and then about him hiding...and more if you can think   
of any. 
I see real comic potential in this situation and you should milk it for 
all it's worth. 
.bt 
Again, the whole interplay on page 6 is very nice.  
It flows very well. 
.bt 
The ending of the scene comes very quickly, and I think it depends too  
much on the male superiority song.  
If it's a good song, you can get away with it; if not, you're going to  
need more dialogue to set things up.
Write the song and we'll see.   
.bt 
The very end is too abrupt, I think.
Maybe the Sheriff needs a line (something that reveals the nature of
their married/sexual lives?).   
I don't know.   
Maybe a line from Marian to explain why she called the guards...sisterhood  
with the Sheriff?   
.bt 
All in all, a very nice scene with lots of nice lines and clean characters. 
.sq 
.bp 
.hd 'DUEL PERSONALITIES -- John McMullen'   
Unfortunately I'm rushed for time as I write here, so I can't give you  

much detail, but I'll hurry through.
.bt 
The opening is fine.
Perhaps you want to make the certainty of Fifi's infidelity greater when
it first comes up.  
It feels like Francois should brag more about the duel with the last lover; 
saying it was a draw is not that Gallic.
.bt 
The friction between Armand and Francois is a little muddy (bottom of 1,
top of 2).  
I think more directness would help. 
.bt 
The duel thing is all right.
It would work well in the right hands, but it would be very iffy if you 
didn't have exactly the right people.   
I don't know what you do about that.
.bt 
On page 3, you should make more of an issue of speaking 
.ul 
English 
to Robin; otherwise, the joke doesn't come off. 
Apart from that, the scene works nicely.
.bt 
The Sheriff's speech impediment (Elmer Fudd or just British twit?) is   
a good comic gimmick that you have worked with well (the names that Robin   
gives later, for example).  
.bt 
The initial scene between Marian and the Sheriff is fine.   
.bt 
I think Cassandra needs more personality, especially if the arguments about 
the price are going to work.rtunAlso, there are a couple of points in the argument where the wor

Also, there are a couple of points in the argument where the wording could  
be improved to make the meaning clearer.
For example, Cassandra's line at the bottom of page 5 is important to set   
up what is coming next, but I don't think it makes its point clearly enough.
.bt 
Of course the gagging business is nice, but I don't have to tell you that.  
.bt 
Top of 7, you should make it just a bit clearer that the finger snaps are   
what cause the personality switch.  
Also, I think you should simplify why the personality changes -- "used  
parts" confuses the issue for me.   
.bt 
I'm not sure that the Thunder and lightning for Cassandra's name is 
set up enough for the Sheriff's "take" on page 7, but that may be clearer   
on stage than on paper. 
.bt 
The French bit at the bottom of 7 is very nice, of course.  
Little John (is he a Mr.T type?) is a bit of a letdown at the end with  
"hinky dinky parley voo".   
Is there something else?
.bt 
The lines after the pate joke are a little flat.
.bt 
Robin's finger snap comes in the wrong place -- it should be at the end 
of the line somehow.
Maybe   
.to 
WILL: Do you think Marian could be under a spell?   gumeROBIN: That's it

ROBIN: That's it!  (With the snap on the "it")  
.tn 
.tp 
The Duelling Fingersnaps and the Addams Family closing is wonderful.
.bt 
Why a flashpot? 
Why Will's final line (yes, I get the Lurch reference, but it's a little
obscure)?   
I certainly understand why Marian would collapse.   
Maybe you can establish that Marian is the one who is somehow keeping the   
guards from attacking Robin and company, so that when she collapses the 
guards can go ahead.
I think you need to work on the ending more to have it work.
.bt 
Overall, some very nice bits, and a brilliant song. 
Touch up the rest and you're laughing.  
.sq 
.bp 
.hd 'LOVE LETTERS -- David Till'
The set-up of three "normal" guards and one insufferable one works well 
throughout the whole scene. 
You already know that, of course.   
.bt 
Making the Sheriff a neat freak is a nice touch.
Make sure it's not just cosmetic (all talk no action); give him some actions
to demonstrate how squeaky clean he is, e.g. something dirty he has to handle.  
.bt 
I think it's important to stress that Marian's love notes will ask the  
Merry men to rescue her bare-handed.
.bt ariaMarian's personality needs to be established mor

Marian's personality needs to be established more vividly somehow.  
Otherwise, the Sheriff's final threat on page 3 doesn't have the oomph it   
needs (a different threat might be better, of course).  
.bt 
I think you need a stronger line for the fade-out on the guards (page 3).   
How about letting everyone say the "Shut up, nerd" line and switch to   
the next scene right there. 
.bt 
The beginning of the next scene needs work. 
I know you're trying to establish character, but you're using mostly words. 
Have them doing something real that the love letters interrupt. 
(You don't need to explain the circumstances of Marian's capture.   
Presumably the audience saw that in a previous scene.)  
.bt 
You need more stuff when the love letters first arrive so that the audience 
understands what they are.  
For example, Little John trying to read the note word by word might be a
good funny bit...or perhaps him shouting to Friar Tuck something like,  
"What does F-E-L-L-A-T-I-O spell?"  
Then again, maybe not.  
.bt 
Yes, the "Yours Sincerely" is nice. 
.bt 
Maybe you could put the Peasant Woman in earlier.   
This establishes Alan's personality 
.ul 
before  o bethe love letters

the love letters come.  
Once the love letters come, I suspect people will want to see you follow
those up and the peasant stuff will just get in the way.    
.bt 
At the meeting, ask for help with the song from anyone who's there. 
.bt 
In general, I think the scene in the forest has a lot of "running past" 
(as I describe in the hand-out this week).  
Take it a little slower and look for opportunities to fill things out.  
.bt 
The entrance back at the castle is very nice (four people in unison).   
I think you need to make more of the interplay between Marian and Alan; 
after all, this is the thing that makes her call in the guards. 
Why doesn't she call for help from Robin instead?   
(Come up with a reason.)
.bt 
You might consider using something more vivid than the phrase "mad passionate   
sex" in all the places it crops up. 
Perhaps suggest a specific kinky activity.  
.bt 
Overall some very nice stuff.   
As I said before, I think you can afford to expand a lot of it -- you've set
up some good situations that will give you more mileage with a bit of work. 
.sq 
.bp 
.hd 'NOT THE MARION KIND -- Ronald M. Green' AlaYou have the only script I've read (so far) that sexuall

You have the only script I've read (so far) that sexually integrates Robin's
outlaws.
A good touch, especially in the context of FASS.
.bt 
The first page of the scene is a little slow.   
The "narrow flight" (from Two Minute Mysteries?) may be a little tough for  
the audience to catch, but the special effect is nice.  
.bt 
The strategies for keeping King Richard away are nicely done.   
You should make it clearer that this is why the wise men are making 
these suggestions -- there's a little too much business between the 
Sheriff's opening speech and the Wise suggestions for the audience to   
remember what they're talking about.
.bt 
By the way, the casual killing is very nice.
Sets up the Sheriff's character quite well. 
.bt 
Small point: the "...and women..." on page 3 should be said by Elmira, not  
the Captain -- otherwise, the Sheriff is likely to kill the Captain too.
.bt 
The Monty Python stuff on page 3 is pushing it, but...  
.bt 
The quick interchange between the Sheriff and Marion (bottom of 3) is clean 
and nice.   
As is the messenger running through walls.  
And the panel stuff -- this sort of physical humour almost always works.
.bt ad (The "Fire at Will" l

The "Fire at Will" line is good, provided that the audience is already  
clear that this person is Will Scarlet. 
I don't think it would hurt to call Will by name sometime just before   
the line, just to make sure they get the joke.  
.bt 
The third guard's line after Fire at Will is a bit weak and delays  
the "Frankly Scarlet" joke, which is much funnier.  
.bt 
I'm not sure about Friar Tuck's next line.  
Maybe it will work if he's got seventeen arrows sticking out of him, but... 
.bt 
The Sheriff's tirade about techies is nice. 
.bt 
I think Marion needs some kind of reaction shortly after she's jilted   
in favour of Elmira.
She's not the sort to sit idly by, and it's a good opportunity for some 
funny catty remark. 
.bt 
I like the band line.   
.bt 
I have trouble with the Sheriff's laughing fit. 
I think the audience will too.  
They like more direct explanations for why someone keels over unconscious   
(did you notice how Mary Anne fainting in 2-3 this year confused everyone?).
Perhaps Little Joan could inadvertantly do something that bonks him.
.bt 
Try writing the romantic duet.  
If you need help, ask someone at the meeting.   
.bt ad (Nice ending -- a lit


..].....
jagardner...

Nice ending -- a little drama never hurt anyone.
.bt 
Overall, some very funny lines and a lot of good pacing.
Just work on the opening a little more and you'll be all set.   
.sq 
.bp 
.hd 'COURTROOM WARS -- Richard Tummers' 
I think what you have to watch for more than anything else is muddiness:
several different threads of thought happening simultaneously without much  
to hold things together.
For example,
to simplify the opening, just have Robin send in Will directly to spy out   
the land -- the unscalable wall is just a distraction that never really 
comes up again. 
All that eventually happens is that Will goes in, and you shouldn't 
introduce much that goes in different directions from this. 
.bt 
As another example, you have Guard~2 talk about payday a bit later on.  
This is confusing.  
The line about input/output devices (just before that) is a funny comment   
on what is happening, so it works; the payday line is just too far removed. 
.bt 
When we first see Marian, she's talking about criminals and this will   
become more important later on -- she gets mad at the Merry Men precisely   
because she has become a criminal.   meeSince this is so important, try to do mo

Since this is so important, try to do more than just talk about her 
feelings -- show them somehow.  
For example, if you move the setting of the scene to a dungeon, you can 
have Marian locked in with another criminal and show how she reacts to  
him/her.
This makes the point more vividly...and gives you more chance for   
laughs if the criminal or his/her crime is funny in some way.   
.bt 
In fact, a criminal who has nothing to do with the action could prove a good
foil throughout the whole Sheriff/Marian/Courtroom proceedings: throwing in 
rude comments or witty remarks, asking questions that need to be asked, etc.
.bt 
I presume the "yellow fingers" line is related to the joke "Let your pages  
do the walking through the yellow fingers". 
Unfortunately, it's not clear enough so you'll have to rework it.   
.bt 
Try to write the song about Judge Vader.
If you need help, ask people at the meeting.
.bt 
I'm worried about the references to Alderaan being too much of an in-joke.  
Granted, most people have seen Star Wars, but I'm not so sure that they 
remember it that clearly.   
By sticking so closely to the Star Wars material (Dantooine, etc.), you 
limit yourself a great deal.o mo

Extended imitation in this way is very difficult to pull off.   
.bt 
The line "Holy Batman! I've got to tell Robin!" is very nice.   
To make it work, you have to do a little more to establish the position of  
"batman".   
The title is not as well known as you may think; maybe the Sheriff will have
to talk about his batman for a while...or perhaps someone can ask what a
batman is.  
.bt 
On page 2, you have several lines that only make sense if you realize   
that the trial is going to be trial by combat.  
You should make this point much earlier.
.bt 
Page 3 has very little humour in it -- the Star Wars allusions aren't   
going to be enough to save it, I fear.  
Perhaps if you play up the courtroom aspect a little more and have some 
legal humour....
.bt 
The choking bit is nice.
.bt 
The whole manicure bit doesn't seem to go anywhere. 
It needs a pay-off somehow. 
.bt 
Overall, I think you need to simplify what you are trying to do so you  
can do everything clearly.  
Rather than trying to do several things at once, concentrate on developing  
one particular seed to its fullest and you end up with more in the end. 
.sq 
.bp you .hd 'ROBIN AND MARIAN -- Brenz and S

.hd 'ROBIN AND MARIAN -- Brenz and Suzanne' 
Nice set.   
And it establishes who Marian is very nicely.   
.bt 
Once you bring up the microwave oven, you're more or less bound to do   
something with it...more of a joke than is there already.   
.bt 
I like Little John. 
Stopping to read each sign is a very neat way to establish his character
before he even speaks.  
.bt 
To identify everyone as they come in (at least Will Shakespeare), someone   
should mention names.   
Either Marian should greet them by name or you should have some sort of 
comic servant announcing the guests.
This could actually give you some fun opportunities.
.bt 
I like Will's "Look!" gambit.   
.bt 
The bit from "Where have all the flowers gone" is pretty lame.  
I'd go right into "I could have danced".
.bt 
I like the song...does the final part scan? 
I can't make it work, but right now I'm pretty rushed.  
.bt 
The convocation hood/Robin hood pun is a good idea, but I think it needs
to be presented more clearly.   
.bt 
I like the yesterday song too.  
But the Engineer song is better, and there is always a problem of too   
many songs...depends on the rest of the show, of course.
.bt 

The lines after the Engineer song are a little tame.
I know this is setting up character, but you don't spend enough time on 
anyone to let it really work.   
At this point, perhaps you should pick one character to establish very  
clearly and assume that the others will be established at other points  
of the show.
.bt 
It should be clearer that Marian is trying to delay Robin so he can get 
his degree (if that's what she's doing at the bottom of page 7).
At least put this in the stage directions.  
.bt 
I'll believe the amazing technical wizardry when I see it.  
For the purposes of the workshop, you may want to come up with some 
brilliantly funny line for Little John to say to prove that he's turned 
into a Yuppie.  
.bt 
Line 57 -- I'd say the Argh should stand on its own (without the preceding  
sentence) or else come up with a preceding sentence that's much funnier.
.bt 
By the way, sneaking up on people with graduation hoods should be a nice
bit of business.
.bt 
I like line 68. 
.bt 
The last page needs punching up a little.   
Again, I think you want this part to be Marian delaying Robin so that he
can be "hooded" by the Sheriff. restThis can lead to physical humour

This can lead to physical humour of various kinds.  
.bt 
Overall, a lot of good bits.
I think paying attention to Marian can beef up some of the thin parts.  
.bt 
By the way, you had Marian continually bossing Gertruda around but there
was no punchline/pay-off to that routine.   
Think about having Gertruda do something in the end to bring that all to
a head -- perhaps she can do something malicious that saves Robin.  
(I think the outline did say they were supposed to escape.) 
.sq 
.bp 
.hd 'UNTITLED -- David Welbourn'
The first page could be shortened a bit -- it's a lead-in to the song, which
is a good thing, but it doesn't have many funny bits in it (except Little   
John's first line). 
.bt 
The song is nice; I'm not sure that the verses scan, but I don't know   
the original well enough to be certain. 
.bt 
I think you have to do a little more deriding of the Sheriff's plan -- this 
seems to be business as usual in Sherwood Forest, and you have to make that 
a little bigger (i.e. make sure we know this happens every day).
.bt 
I like the whole sequence of the fish & chips, and taking out the guards.   
.bt be ""That's blended" doesn't make as much sense as the other two

"That's blended" doesn't make as much sense as the other two.   
Ask for suggestions at the meeting if you need help.
.bt 
The slaughter scene is, of course, beyond the bounds of usual good taste,   
but what the hell?  
.bt 
Somewhere around Guard 16, the killing gets out of hand.
All right, all right, all right, but for a  
.ul 
real
scene, there's a limit to what one can do.  
.bt 
Honestly, I don't think it could ever work as a scene onstage, but it's 
screamingly funny.  
Why do you do these things to me?   
.sq
