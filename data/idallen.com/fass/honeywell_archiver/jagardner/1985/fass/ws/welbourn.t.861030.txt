ROBIN HOOD AND ALL HIS MEN ARE PLANNING HOW TO RESCUE MAID MARIAN.) 
.ch rh  
Okay, my merry band, we've got to storm this castle and rescue Maid Marian. 
How are we going to get by the Sheriff and all his guards?  
.ch ws  
He will be expecting one of our usual plans.
.ch lj  
But he won't be expecting ALL of our plans, Robin.  
.ch al  
We have 30 different plans. 
How are we going to pull it off?
.ch ft  
That's going to be a big job.   
.sb "Thirty Ways to Kill a Guard" "Fifty Ways to Leave your Lover"  
ROBIN:  But listen here,
        We can surprise them all this day   
        We'll use a new plan on each guard  
        That's in our way   
        And I know that you will all
        Believe me when I say   
        There must be   
ALL:    Thirty ways to kill the guards off. 
        Thirty ways to kill the guards off.

ROBIN:  Go in and kill, Will.   
        Drown them in muck, Tuck.   
        Lead them all on, John. 
        Just listen to me.  
        Go swing that flail, Dale.  
        Let's hear that chain wail  
        Poison their swill, Will
        And set my love free.   
.ve 8   
        Although you think this castle  
        Has security
        With co-op guardsman it's a sham,   
        A mockery   
        So there really are no problems 
        That I can foresee  
        There must be   
ALL:    Thirty ways to kill the guards off. 
        Thirty ways to kill the guards off.

ROBIN:  Cut out their entrails, Dale.   
        Grind them to nil, Will.
        Stats till they yawn, John. 
        Just listen to me.  
        Get 'em all stuck, Tuck.
        Won't need that much luck.  
        Throw them in jail, Dale.   
        And set my love free.

Did you know that I have a new plan to capture Robin and his outlaw band?   
.ch mm  
You always have a plan. 
.ch sh  
A most sinister plan, if I do say so myself.
I'm going to hold an archery contest.   
.ch mm  
You always have an archery contest. 
You had one yesterday.  
.ch sh  
But this archery contest is different!  
The winner will get a golden arrow! 
.ch mm  
You always give out golden arrows.  
Robin has so many of them that his quiver's gone condo. 
.ch sh  
But he'll still come, won't he? 
.ch mm  
He'll chop you up into luncheon meat.   
But he'll come.

In fact, he's coming...right about...now!

.ch g1  
Hold it right there!
What are you doing with that pushcart?  
.ch rh  
We're selling fish and chips.   
.ch ft  
I'm the fish friar. 
.ch rh  
And I'm the chip monk.  
.ch g1  
Let me have a fish stick with lots of batter.

Here's the stick, and here's the batter.

Here they are!  
Don't let them get away!
.ch g8  
Yeah, what's the big idea, killing us all off?  
You think it's easy being a co-op guard?
.ch g11 
You don't get no respect.   
.ch g12 
You wouldn't think men of the cloth would stoop to senseless gratuitous 
violence.   
.ch lj  
It isn't gratuitous, the audience paid. 
.ch ws  
And they're not both monks, just the fat one.   
.ch ft  
I beg your pardon!  
.ch ws  
Well, I wouldn't say Friar Tuck is fat, but I will say that he's two of 
the nicest men I've ever worked with.   
.ch lj  
I wouldn't say Friar Tuck is fat, but I will say that the last time he  
was on a ferris wheel, the two guys on top starved to death.

C'est la vie, one man's meat is another man's poison.   
.ch g20 
But...I wasn't poisoned.
.ch al  
Well, the explanation goes back to basic statistics, wherein you take the   t leaverage lifespan of castle-dwelling guar

average lifespan of castle-dwelling guards in an untenable position,
the relative likelihood function of being killed can be determined using
a Poisson distribution...   
.ch g20 
(GURGLING)  
No, don't say it!
