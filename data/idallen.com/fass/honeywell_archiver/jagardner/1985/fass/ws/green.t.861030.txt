(LIGHTS UP ON THE TUNNELS UNDER SHERIFF'S CASTLE.   
THE MARRIED MEN AND WOMEN ENTER.)   
.ch rh  
We're almost there, men.
.ch al  
People! 
.ch rh  
People. 
.ch ft  
Finally!
After all the time we've spent wandering around in these hidden tunnels.
Turns and twists, dead ends, confusing offshoots... 
.ch ws  
I told you, we left the Arts quadrangle hours ago.  
.ch ft  
Even so, Will, I can't go on much longer.   
.ch rh  
Relax.  
The Sheriff's audience chamber is just beyond the panel at the top of   
(POINTING OFFSTAGE) those stairs.   
.ch sb  
Are you sure?   
.ch rh  
Positive.   
It's just a narrow flight away. 
.ch sb  
I doubt it. 
.ad 
(AN ARROW APPEARS IN THE SINGLE BOWPERSON'S CHEST.) 
.ex 
I hate it when you're always right. 
.ad 
(HE/SHE DIES.)  
.ch rh  
Get that bowman!
.ad 
(ALL IMMEDIATELY BEGIN TO STRING THE BOWPERSON FOR LOOT.)   
.ex 
I meant the guard on the stairs.
Quick, before they sound an alarm.  
.ad 
(ALL RUN QUICKLY OFFSTAGE.) 
.ld 
(SWITCH TO THE SHERIFF'S AUDIENCE CHAMBER.  
IT HAS ONLY ONE VISIBLE ENTRANCE, ALTHOUGH THERE IS A "SECRET" ONE. 
THE ROOM SHOULD LOOK MODERATELY ORNATE. 
THE SCENE OPENS WITH THE SHERIFF, THE WISE MEN, AND THE GUARDS  
WITH THEIR CAPTAIN ON STAGE.)   
.ch sh  
No, no, no! 
This will not do.   
.ad 
(HE THROWS THE LETTERS HE IS HOLDING ONTO THE GROUND.)  
.ex 
I need an excuse that will keep King Richard from returning for as long as  
possible.   
Why oh why did he have to win the Crusades so quickly?  
.ch g1  
I guess somebody up there likes him.
.ch sh  
(TO CAPTAIN)
Kill him, will you? 
.ch ca  
Right.  
.ad 
(HE DOES SO.)   
.ch sh  
Thanks. 
Now, I need an idea to keep Richard away... 
.ch w1  
The weather is terrible.
.ch w2  
You want to borrow some money.  
.ch w3  
You want him to meet your sister.   
.ch sh  
Hmm.
They all have their merits, but I need something big.   
.ch w3  
I already mentioned your sister.
.ch sh  
Aha, I have it! 
I will inform him of another Crusade.   
He has a thing about them, you know.
.ch w1  
Where?  
The Holy Land is secured.   
.ch w2  
Europe is peaceful. 
.ch w3  
And nobody cares about Village Two. 
.ch sh  
Elmira! 
.ad 
(ENTER ELMIRA, THE SHERIFF'S SISTER.)   
.ch el  
Yes, brother?   
.ch sh  
No, no, no! 
I meant the town of Elmira. 
Not only will Richard have to cross the Atlantic to get to it, it won't 
even exist for at least another four hundred years. 
Perfect!
.ch g2  
I like it.  
.ch g3  
Me too! 
.ch g4  
I'm not so sure...  
.ad 
(THE SHERIFF SIGNALS TO THE CAPTAIN, WHO KILLS GUARD~4.)
.ch sh  
Well?   
.ch g5  
Fine with me.   
.ch g6  
Sure.   
.ch sh  
Good, it's settled then.
I'll send a royal messenger to bear word of these "tragic developments" 
to Richard. 
That will give me all the time I need to implement my master plan, to   
rid me of Robin Hood and his Married Men... 
.ch el  
And women...
.ch sh  
And women, once and for all!
.ch ca  
How will you do that?   
.ch sh  
As you will recall, all of my previous plans have failed.   
.ch w1  
I remember those 16-ton weight traps... 
.ch w2  
Most tragic.
And then there was the garrison armed with various fruits...
.ch w3  
As well as the ambush using that Trojan rabbit...   
.ch sh  
Enough! 
My plan takes an entirely new approach. 
Instead of trying to capture them all, we wait until the next time the  
guards encounter them, and then...  
.ch ca  
Yes?
Yes?
.ch sh  
We shoot them full of arrows until they drop dead!  
.ad 
(SILENCE ON STAGE FOR A MOMENT, THEN...)
.xx ALL 
Brilliant!!!
.ch sh  
Thank you, thank you.   
And now, the first stage of the plan: the phony Crusade.
.ad 
(HE QUICKLY WRITES OUT A NOTE.) 
.ex 
There!  
But I need an official witness to this note.
Someone Richard will trust. 
Hmmm...bring me Maid Marion.
.ad 
(ENTER THE ROYAL MESSENGER WITH MAID MARION.)   
.ch mm  
I overheard your fiendish plot. 
I will sign no such thing!  
.ch sh  
I'll lock you in the dungeons.  
.ch mm  
You'll never have my help!  
.ch sh  
I'll chop off your fingers. 
.ch mm  
Then I definitely won't sign!   
.ch sh  
I'll serve budgie wings for dinner again.   
.ch mm  
Got a quill?
.ad 
(SHE SIGNS THE NOTE.)   
.ch sh  
Excellent.  
Elmira, take her back to her quarters.  
.ad 
(EXIT ELMIRA WITH MARION.   
THE SHERIFF HANDS THE NOTE TO THE MESSENGER.)   
.ex 
Here, take this to the king as quickly as possible, and let nothing stand   
in your way!
.ch rm  
Right!  
.sd 
(HE EXITS, RUNNING. 
CRASHING AND CRUMBLING NOISES ARE HEARD OFFSTAGE.)  
.ch sh  
I meant no living thing, you fool!  
My poor walls...oh well, at least the rest of the castle is still intact.   
.ad 
(HE CASUALLY LEANS AGAINST A PANEL, WHICH FALLS ON TOP OF HIM AS THE
MARRIED MEN -- AND WOMEN -- COME CHARGING IN.   
THE WISE MEN RUN OFF.)  
.ex 
Umph!?  
.ch rh  
See, I told you -- the audience chamber.
.ch ws  
(LOOKING AT THE AUDIENCE)   
Can't argue with the man.   
.ch al  

Shut up, Will!  
It's the enemy! 
Let's get them! 
.ad 
(THE GUARDS AND ROBIN'S BAND CHARGE EACH OTHER, ENDING UP UPSTAGE.  
SOME DISTANCE DOWNSTAGE ARE WILL SCARLET, GUARD 3, AND THE CAPTAIN.)
.ch ca  
We've been breached.
Fire at will!   
.ad 
(HE MOVES TOWARDS WILL.)
.ch ws  
No, don't kill me!  
I have a family to support, kids... 
.ch ca  
Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn.  
.ad 
(HE STABS WILL. 
WILL DIES.) 
.ch g3  
But all he ever did was tell stupid jokes and sing dumb songs.  
FASS will never forgive us! 
.ad 
(THE PEOPLE UPSTAGE DRIFT BACK AND SEE THIS AS THE MELEE PAUSES A MOMENT.   
SEVERAL OF ROBIN AND HIS BAND HAVE KNIVES AND ARROWS STUCK IN THEM. 
FRIAR TUCK IS THE WORST BY FAR.)
.ch rh  
They've stabbed Will!   
.ch ft  
They've stabbed Will, he says!  
If it weren't for the fact that I've got enough fat to compete with 
Food Services...
.ch al  
Forget that!
They've killed Will, and I demand a retributive strike! 
.ch lj  
Spare them no mercy!
.ch ca  
Let's split, guys.  
.ad 
(THE CAPTAIN AND THE GUARDS EXIT QUICKLY.)  
.ch al  
They aren't getting away!   
After them! 
.ad 
(ALANA AND JOAN RUN OFF AFTER THEM.)
.ch ft  
Well, Robin, what's wrong?  
.ch rh  
It was too easy.
And I don't like the fact that the Sheriff is nowhere to be seen.   
.ch sh  
Urgle?? 
.ch ft  
You hear something? 
.ch rh  
Only a faint "Urgle??". 
Probably some techie bumping into something.
.ad 
(THE SHERIFF HEAVES OFF THE PANEL AND STANDS UP.)   
.ch sh  
That does it!   
I am mad!   
I don't mind you putting more holes in my castle -- it's tax-deductible.
I don't even mind that you hunt down and kill off most of my guards -- I
do it all the time. 
But when you refer to me as a techie... 
.ch rh  
Gee, I'm sorry. 
.ch sh  
I am an antagonist! 
I go around doing nasty things like killing people and kidnapping supporting
characters like Maid Marion!
And another thing...
.ad 
(ENTER ELMIRA WITH MAID MARION.)
.ch el  
You want Maid Marion?   
.ch sh  
Usually, but not right now. 
I'm in the middle of a dramatic confrontation.  
.ch rh  
Oh, vision of loveliness... 
.ad 
(HE RUNS TOWARDS MARION AND ELMIRA.)
.ch sh  
So much for dramatic confrontation. 
.ch mm  
Oh Robin... 
.ad 
(ROBIN RUNS PAST MARION AND STOPS IN FRONT OF ELMIRA)   
.ch el  
Oh Robin... 
.ch rh  
I've dreamed of meeting a woman like you all my life.   
.ch el  
Really? 
Oh Robin... 
.ad 
(THEY EMBRACE.) 
.ch mm  
(DISGUSTED) 
Oh Robin... 
.ad 
(ELMIRA PULLS BACK AFTER A MOMENT.) 
.ch el  
Robin, you have to stop the messenger headed for King Richard, or the   
Sheriff will kill your entire band! 
.ch rh  
I thought they played too loudly anyway.
.ad 
(THE SHERIFF, IGNORED, MAKES A MOTION OFFSTAGE. 
THE DROP BEGINS TO COME DOWN OVER ROBIN, FRIAR TUCK, AND ALANA DALE, WHO HAS
JUST COME BACK ON STAGE.)   
.ch el  
No Robin, I mean
.ul 
your
band.   
.ch rh  
Oh, that band.  
Right, we'll just...zounds! 
.sd 
(THE DROP PAUSES JUST ABOVE THE HEADS OF ROBIN, TUCK, AND ALANA.
VARIOUS STRANGE SOUND EFFECTS COME FROM OFFSTAGE AND ABOVE.)
.ex 
Zounds, not "sounds"!   
.sd 
(THE SOUND EFFECTS STOP.)   
.ex 
What's going on?
.ch sh  
At last, I have the drop on you and your companions.
You are all at my mercy, so tell me where your collected loot is, or I'll   
have you boiled alive.  
.ch ft  
You can't do that!  
I'm not a boiler, I'm a Friar!  
.ad 
(LITTLE JOAN ENTERS.)   
.ch rh  
Little Joan!
Quick, kill the lights! 
.ad 
(WHIPPING OUT A TWO-HANDED SWORD, JOAN PROCEEDS TO ANNIHILATE ANYTHING IN   
THE ROOM WHICH IS A LIGHT SOURCE: TORCHES, CANDLESTICKS, THE CHANDELIERS,   
AND LAMPS, ANYTHING.
THE SIGHT IS UTTERLY RIDICULOUS.)   
.ch sh  
Ha, ha, ha! 
Ah, ha, ha, ha...   
.ad 
(SWINGING WILDLY, JOAN STRIKES THE SHERIFF WITHOUT REALIZING IT.
HE FALL UNCONSCIOUS.
ELMIRA HELPS ROBIN, TUCK, AND ALANA OUT FROM UNDER THE DROP.)   
.ch el  
There, you're free. 
.ch rh  
Oh Elmira, I will never be free now that I have seen you.   
.ad 
(AT THIS POINT, THERE SHOULD BE A ROMANTIC DUET BETWEEN ROBIN AND ELMIRA,   
WITH MAYBE THE OTHERS SINGING BACK-UP.) 
.ch mm  
I've had enough of this.
At least the Sheriff paid me some attention.
Robin, look at me.  
.ch rh  
Hmm.
Do I know you, miss?
.ch mm  
Argh!   
Get out, get out this instant!  
.ch rh  
But...Elmira... 
.ch el  
Robin!  
.ch mm  
(PICKING UP A SWORD)
Get out, Get Out, GET OUT!!!
.ch ft  
Uh Robin, we really should stop that messenger. 
.ch rh  
All right.  
Let's go, men.  

.ch al  
People! 
.ch rh  
People. 
.ad 
(ROBIN, TUCK, ALANA, AND JOAN EXIT THROUGH THE SECRET PANEL.)   
.ch el  
Until we meet again!
.ch mm  
(GLARING AFTER THEM)
Until we meet again.
