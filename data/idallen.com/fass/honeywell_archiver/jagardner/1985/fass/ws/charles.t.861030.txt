ROBIN AND HIS MERRY MEN ARE GATHERED TOGETHER AS ROBIN EXPLAINS THE PLAN.)  
.ch rh  
Remember, we'll all meet at the south side of the castle at exactly 16:00   
hours.  
By sixteen-o-three, we will have breached the wall. 
We will then lay down a covering fire while Little John breaks down the 
door to Marian's cell.  
Alan-a-Dale and Friar Tuck will fight a delaying action while the rest  
of us make a strategic advance to the rear. 
When we reach the west tower, we will dive into the moat.   
Little John and Will Scarlet will plant submerged charges on the wall as
a diversion.
In the confusion, we will swim to safety.   
Any questions?  
.ch ws  
Did you say jump into the moat, Uncle Robby?
.ch rh  
Yes, the moat.  
And stop calling me Uncle!  
.ch ws  
The icky, gooey, shark-infested moat?   
.ch rh  
Yes, you'll find it refreshing. 
.ch lj  
How we get through big wall, Robin? 
.ch rh  
Through the use of my new secret weapon.
.ch lj  
What is new weapon, Robin?  
.ch rh  
If I told you that it wouldn't be a secret any more.

(MUNCHING SIDE OF BEEF) 
Never mind that, I want to know when we can get going.  
I haven't had my second lunch yet and I'm hungry.   
.ch al  
What do you call that?  
.ch ft  
A mere appetizer.   
.ch rh  
Enough of this. 
Now everyonw, syncronize your watches.  
I've got twenty after one.  
.ch al  
Ten after two.

High noon.

The little hand is at the three and the big hand is at the two. 
.ch ws  
Uncle Robby, my sundial stopped!
.ch rh  
Never mind. 
We'll meet outside the castle at the next change of the guard.  
.ch ws  
Remember to keep quiet. 
Uncle Robby wants the element of surprise on our side.  
.ch rh  
Right, let's go.

(ROBIN AND HIS MEN BEGIN TO MARCH OFF STAGE IN MILITARY FORMATION,  
SINGING A MARCHING SONG.)   
.sb "Robin" "Chant" 
ROBIN:  Who's the leader of this band?  
REST:   It's our Robin, he's our man.   
ROBIN:  Time to rescue Marian.  
REST:   With our Robin's brilliant plan.
ROBIN:  Sound off!  
REST:   One, two.   
ROBIN:  Sound off!  
REST:   Three, four.
ALL:    Sound off, one two ... three four!

GENERAL CRASHING.)

TWO OTHER GUARDS.)

Have you see Robin Hood and his men about, Captain? 
.ch ca  
No sir, I haven't.

What do you think I pay you one shilling a week for?

Look harder.

Look harder!

(HITTING GUARD 2)   
Look harder!
.ch sh  
He mustn't be allowed to interfere in my plans. 
I'm going to woo Marian and make her marry me.  
And, according to English law, all her property becomes mine.   
This will give me the deed to Sherwood forest.  
And once I have that, Robin is finished.
.ch ca  
How is that, sir?   
.ch sh  
(HITTING CAPTAIN)   .ld I plan to tear it down so that Robin and his men

I plan to tear it down so that Robin and his men have no home and no place  
to hide.
Then I'll build a parking lot, you ninny!

Yes sir.

.ch sh  
I'll earn millions by telling the peasants that their money will go to the  
funds for King Richard's ransom.
But, in actuality, I'm building it to pay off our friends who kidnapped 
Richard.
For the Germans, I'll build the "Parken zee Deutsch".   
For the French, the "Park de Triomphe". 
And for the Saracens, "Camel-lot"!  
Now, keep looking.  
I'm going inside to woo my future bride.
.xx GUARDS  
(SALUTING)  
Yes sir!
.sd 
(THE GUARDS EXIT ONE WAY, THE SHERIFF THE OTHER.
THEN WE HEAR THE SOUND OF A LARGE BOW STRING BEING LET LOOSE, FOLLOWED BY   
THE SOUND OF SOMETHING SCREAMING THROUGH THE AIR, AND THEN A LOUD CRASH.
THE CURTAIN RISES TO REVEAL A LARGE PRISON CELL THAT IS WELL DECORATED  
AND RESEMBLES A GILDED CAGE.
ONE WALL IS IN RUINS WHERE A LARGE ARROW-SHAPED VEHICLE HAS BROKEN THROUGH. 
MARIAN IS ON THE BED SLEEPING.  
THE VEHICLE HAS A DOOR ON THE SIDE. 
THROUGH THE DOOR COME ROBIN AND THE MERRY MEN IN SWAT-LIKE FASHION.)
.ch rh  
Remember men, we've got to find Marian. 
Search everywhere!

I'll go look in the kitchen.

Oh no you don't!
No more food until I have Marian in my arms.

Look, Robin, on the bed.

(WAKING)
Oh my brave Robikins, you've come to rescue me. 
.ch rh  
It doesn't look like you need rescuing. 
What does this all mean?
.ch mm  
The Sheriff put me up in this beautiful room after he captured me.  
He's been most kind.
In fact, he wants to marry me.  
.ch rh  
You told him no, didn't you.
.ch mm  
Well, I told him I'd give him his answer later. 
This IS a beautiful room, isn't it? 
.ch rh  
You're not seriously thinking of marrying that... that... crumb!
.ch mm  
Relax, I'm not going to marry him.  
I only wanted to make you jealous.  
Besides, he's only after my deed to Sherwood Forest.
.ch rh  
The deed to Sherwood!   
If he gets that, I'm out of a home and a job.   
.ch mm  
don't worry, now that you're here to rescue me, we have nothing to fear.
How did you get in here in the first place? 
.ch rh  
With the use of my trusty CPA.  
.ch mm  
What has your accountant to do with this?   
.ch rh  
No darling, my Castle Piercing Arrow.   
(HE POINTS TO THE VEHICLE)  
.ch mm  
You expect to get back out using that contraption?  
.ch al  
I'm afraid not, my lady.
The CPA is a one-shot invention.
Little John's brother used all his strength to launch us through that wall. 
.ch mm  
Little John's brother?  
.ch lj  
My big brother, Tiny John.  
.ch ws  
He lives in Essex, Wessex, and Kent.
.ch rh  
Don't worry, my dear, I have an ingenious plan for our escape.  
When we are free of here, we'll go back to the tranquillity 
of Sherwood Forest.

.sb "Sherwood Forest" "Green Acres" 
ROBIN:  
Sherwood Forest is the place to be  
Forest hunting is the life for me   
Oppression we will stand no more
We'll rob the rich and give it all to the poor.

(MARIAN)
No, a palace is where I'd rather stay.  
Servants are the only poor I'd pay  
I just adore a tower view   
Darling I love you but give me a castle too.

Living an honest life out in the wilderness.
Neighbours to the deer and the bear.
Foraging for our daily bread, hunting for our meat. 
It will be a glorious life. 
All we have to do is climb the highest tower and swan dive into the moat.   
.ch mm  
The moat?   
.ch rh  
Yes, my dear.

The icky, gooey, shark-infested moat?

Won't it be refreshing?

(YELLING AT TOP OF HER LUNGS)   
Sheriff!
.ch al  
What are you doing, my lady?
You'll give us all away!
.ch mm  
That's the general idea!
I'm not jumping into any scummy moat.   
Sharks I can handle, but that icky gooey part...SHERIFF!

Aiding and abetting an escaping criminal, destruction of public property,
