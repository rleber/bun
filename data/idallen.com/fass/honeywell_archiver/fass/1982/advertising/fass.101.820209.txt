IMPORTANT NOTICE
FOR 
ALL STUDENTS
AT THE  
UNIVERSITY OF WATERLOO

In an emergency meeting of the UW senate and the Board of Directors,
neither of which took place, a motion was passed making a new Winter
term course \f2COMPULSORY\fP for \f2ALL\fP undergraduate students,  
graduate students, faculty members, staff, and administration,  
both on-campus and off. 
Due to a gross oversight by university officials, the following 
entry is conspicuously and quite rightly missing from the 1981-82   
Undergraduate Calendar.

walrus, Hamlet in 3 1/2 minutes, the unfailing logic of

closet.

Tuition is the cheapest on campus: $3.00 for each regular class and $3.50   
for each advanced class.  All lectures, labs, and performances are in the   
Humanities Theatre.  So whether you are an old FASSite or a 
starting-this-year-er, whether on-campus or flying in from that Whitehorse  
work term, FASS '82 guarantees you'll make the grade (we get the credit 
though).  Just to make things more difficult, this compulsory course has very   
limited class sizes so register SOON.  The registrar's office has been moved
to the Humanities Box Office to handle the rush.  See you at FASS '82!
