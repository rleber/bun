You can't smoke in the theatre because the fire marshal 
doesn't want to be responsible if you get lung cancer.  
You can't eat or drink refreshments in the theatre because  
the theatre management doesn't want to contribute to anyone's   
obesity.
You can't use cameras during the performance because our actors 
are already over-exposed.   
(Besides, the censor board doesn't permit flashing in the audience.)
You can't use a tape-recorder either;   
the script is copyrighted by the people \f2we\fP stole it from. 
Thank you for observing these rules.
Violators will be sliced, diced, and fed to the Jabberwock.
