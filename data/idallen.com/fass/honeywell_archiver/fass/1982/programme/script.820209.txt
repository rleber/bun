Message from the Chief Scriptwriter 
.HE 
.ti 2m  
Don't let the term ``Chief Scriptwriter'' fool you. 
The writing of this year's FASS script was very much a communal 
effort over which I played only a supervisory role. 
Many people are responsible for the successful creation of  
``Alice in Wonderloo'' and the ones who put the most time and   
effort into it are listed as writers.   
Countless others donated ideas or jokes, but there wasn't enough
room in the program to list everyone.   
However, I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone
who came out to the brainstorming sessions, all the people who  
wrote scenes or songs, and especially those who suffered through
grueling editing sessions.  
Their efforts made my job a lot easier and resulted in a script 
that Lewis Carroll would have been proud of.
