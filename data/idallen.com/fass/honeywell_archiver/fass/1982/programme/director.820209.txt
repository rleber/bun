Poem from the Director

	While watching our performance 
	You might marvel at our cast,  
	``How can these people put on  
	Such a frolic unsurpassed?''   
	Perhaps you'll even start to wish  
	That you were also FASSed.

	So if you care to ask me where 
	We get these loonies from, 
	I'll answer, ``Why, our audience   
	Each year delivers some,   
	They must be mad as Hatters
	Or they never would have come!''
