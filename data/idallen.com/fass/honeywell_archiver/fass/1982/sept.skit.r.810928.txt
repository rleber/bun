Good afternoon!!

What on earth are you two doing??   
.ch dr  
This is our co-op job.  
.ch ud          
As a couple of doors?   
.ch dl  
Sure!  We're in Civil Engineering.  Our co-ordinator said our entire
future careers hinged upon this job.
.ch ud  
Aw, go on!

It's true.  This is a key position.

WAYS.  LEFTDOOR FINDS THIS QUITE HUMOROUS.  SOPHIE MOORE IS THE SECOND-LAST TO GO THROUGH, AND STU DENT

.ch sd  
Oh no -- not another line-up!  I've been standing in line all day!  
.ch sm  
I know -- first we line up to register, then to get our i.d. cards, then
to get our books, and now this! 
.ch sd  
I just can't take these line-ups anymore.  By the way, my name's Stu.   
(WITH DISTASTE) Stu Dent.   
.ch sm  
I see.  My name's Sophie.  (WITH DISGUST) Sophie Moore. 
.ad 
(THEY SHAKE HANDS)

Say, are you the Sophie Moore who lived in East Six last year?  
.ch sm  
That's right.   
.ch sd  
Really?  I hear you fool around...  
.ch sm  
I'm sorry, I'll try to be more quiet next time. 
.ch sd  
(CHANGING THE SUBJECT SLIGHTLY) Well, I'm a frosh and don't 
really know my way around.  I wonder if you could help me...?   
.ch sm  
Depends on what you have in mind.   
.ch sd  
Well, my schedule says that next week I'm supposed to write something called
an "ELP Test".  What does "ELP" stand for?  
.ch sm  
Extremely Long and Pointless.  It's to get you ready for the next four years
.   
.ch sd  
I see.  
.ch sm  
What faculty are you going into?
.ch sd  
I'm still not sure.  Whichever one has the shortest line-up at registration...  
.ch sm  
You mean you're still not registered?  You'd better hurry -- if you don't   
register by the deadline they make you go off on a work term!   
.ch sd  
But how can they make you go on a work term if you don't have any training? 
.ch cr  
They have their ways.   
.ch sd  
Who said that?  
.ch sm  
The coat rack.  
.ch sd  
The coat rack?  
.ch sm  
Uh-huh.  If you don't get registered before Oktoberf

Uh-huh.  If you don't get registered before Oktoberfest they make you into  
co-op furniture.
.ch sd  
How horrible.   
.ch sm  
Oh, it's not that bad.  I once spent a work term as a co-op elevator.   
.ch sd  
I'm almost afraid to ask.  How was the job? 
.ch sm  
It had its ups and downs...

HAIR AND BEARD(?) ENTERS.  HE WALKS OVER TO THE COAT RACK

"MAY ALSO BE USED FOR HATS AND COATS".  HE PROCEEDS TO TAKE OFF 
HIS HAT AND COAT AND HANG THEM THERE)   
.ch sd  
Who's that? 
.ch sm  
That's the university president, Doug L. Wright.
.ch sd  
What does the "L" stand for?
.ch sm  
Leedo.  
.ch sd  
(TO HIMSELF) Doug Leedo Wright.  I see.

(DOUG HAS WANDERED WITHIN HEARING DISTANCE OF STU)  
.ex 
Anyway, I still have no idea what faculty I want to register in.
I don't even know what I want out of university!
.ch dw  
Excuse me, I couldn't help overhearing you.  I'm just about to tour 
the faculties myself, being the new president and all, and I was    
thinking that such a tour might help you come to some decision. 

Why don't you come along?   
.ch sd  
(TO SOPHIE) I'm game if you are.
.ch sm  
I wouldn't say that too loudly.  My ex-boyfriend's a hunter, and you might  
wind up getting stuffed and mounted.  (RUEFULLY) Although not   
necessarily in that order.  
.ch sd  
Well, we're ready.  
.ch dw  
Then follow me.  (APPEARS LOST)  Now where was that science office? 
.ch sd  
What's wrong with him?  
.ch sm  
Oh, it's not at all uncommon for university presidents to lose their
faculties.  
.ch dw  
Ah, here we are!

"SCIENCE  CY TOLOGY".  CY IS BEHIND THE BAR, ABSORBED IN SOME   
UNSEEN WORK.  HE IS SOMETHING OF THE MAD SCIENTIST.  HE NOTICES 
THEM AND COMES OUT FROM BEHIND.)
.ch ct  
Hello, what brings you here today?  
.ch dw  
Cy, I'd like you to meet Stu.  He's trying to decide on a   
faculty to register in. 
.ch ct  
Hello, Stu.  What can I tell you?   
.ch sd  
What were you working on when we came in?   
.ch ct  
Oh, I was setting up the equipment I use to demonstrate what I'm doing  
with my government grant.   
.ch sd  
Really? What does it do?
.ch ct  
It regulates the flow of irrelevent ions through the photosynthetic 
gamma ray chamber and calculates the number of electric impulses    
present in 20 kilopascals of cow dung.  
.ch sd  
That's amazing!! Can you really make that machine do all that?  
.ch ct  
Well, I've only been working on it for two years, but I have
figured out how to make coffee on this little burner here.  
.ch sd  
Well, I'm not all that interested in Physics.   
.ch ct  
No?  How about Earth Sciences (HANDS HIM A HUGE ROCK), or Optometry 
(HANDS HIM AN EYE CHART), or Chemistry (HANDS HIM A RACK OF TEST TUBES) 
or Biology? (HANDS HIM THE FAMOUS RUBBER CHICKEN)   
.ch sd  
Actually, I was thinking of something more practical.   
.ch ct  
Oh, you want engineering then.  Just a second while I mix up something  
that I learned from this grad student over in Biology...

Oh, yes.  We were so proud of the job we did with ES2, (INDICATING THE  
THE BUILDING THEY'RE IN) we thought we'd design another one.
.ch dw  
I remember the last time I was here, almost a year  
ago.  Back then it was just a hole.

It still is.

Do you know the workmen actually tried to throw me into the 
hole, just before they p

hole, just before they poured the concrete? 
.ch sd  
Why would they do a horrible thing like that?   
.ch at  
They wanted to make sure the foundation was Doug Wright.

So what will the new building look like?

I've got the design right here.  Now if you thought ES2 was a   
work of art, take a look at this!!
