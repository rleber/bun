   We don't let McDonalds get us
   Quarter Pounders don't upset us  
   They use polyester lettuce   
   Some people say. 
 (CHORUS CONTINUES IN BACKGROUND WITH)  
      Have it your way  
      Have it your way  
      Have it your way at Burger King...

At Burger King, we flame-broil  
.ul 
our 
burgers, and you select the delicious toppings yourself.
Oh, about McDonalds?
We don't want to say anything, but no one ever got cancer   
eating at Burger King.
