Hello, I, Suzanne Suzannabanana, am here to talk to you about feminine  
hygiene.  You've prawbly never seen a real live celebrity like me, Suzanne  
Suzannabanana talking about these things but believe me, hygiene can be really  
important.  Like the other week I, Suzanne Suzannabanana, went on a date with a 
guy named Richard Feeder from New Jersey.  So I went to my apartment and I  
washed and I put on my clean clothes and I made myself just so cute that I  
almost couldn't stand it and I waited for this guy to show up.  
  Well, he finally shows up and we go out in his car, which prawbly wasn't  
his car but he borrowed it from somebody and as soon as we get in the car I 
start to notice it.  Something smells bad.  So we're ridin' along and I don't wanna 
say nothin' cause this guy is takin' me out to dinner and a movie   
which we never got to because I was sitting there in his car, and he was just   
a talkin' away like he wasn't noticin' nothing and I was looking around for 
whatever smelled bad.   

  So the first thing I do is I lift my arms real subtle like and checked my 
armpits just to make sure that my deodorant hadn't burned out but I was still   
as fresh.  So I knew it had to be him.  So I, Suzanne Suzannabanana, was sitting
there and the smell was getting worse and worse until I figured that maybe  
this guy, Richard Feeder from New Jersey, had a dead animal in his clothes. 
I couldn't stand it.  So finally he tells me again that he's from New Jersey and
I said to him, "If you're from New Jersey, how come you smell like you're   
from Guelph?"   
  So it just goes to show you-- personal hygiene is important so that people
won't think you're from Guelph.
