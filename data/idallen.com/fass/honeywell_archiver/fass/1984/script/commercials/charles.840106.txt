Possible Commercial Ideas   
  - this was mentioned during the writers meetings but I think it was   
    over looked, the advertisement for a fictitious restaurant where
    what the announcer says conflits with the slide picture or action   
    on stage.   
    eg. Announcer mentions their clean up to date kitchen facilities
        and the slide or set shows a greasy infested dive of a backwater
        kitchen, with a cheif that looks like a reject from Frankenstien's  
        laboratory. 
  - How does "Pay Radio" hit you? Especially when this months attraction
    is the greatest hits of Marcel Marseau? 
  - Popel's pocket Genetics Lab!
  - A robot for minding your children called "Robby the Automatic   
    Big Brother". Remmember while your gone out of the house, you need  
    not worry, Big Brother is watching them.
  - Dr. Zeigfried's Brain Washing Clinic, come in and get cleaned of
    everything you've got!
