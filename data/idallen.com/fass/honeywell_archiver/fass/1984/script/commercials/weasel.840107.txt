That's right, Eric.  I'm Phyllis Sandflea, activist against women's rights, 

and you'll also receive a free copy of my book, Why I Like Being A Bubblehead,  
or, Neat Stuff About Household Cleansers, so you can justify treating women like
objects for manipulation.   
And it will help you eliminate tough stains on porcelain.

How much is all that worth? 
But wait!  There's more!  You also get this fabulous Ginsu knife!  It slices,   
it dices, it doubles as a defensive weapon! The fabulous Ginsu knife comes with 
this uni-molded plastic handle, guaranteed not to break while it's intact.  
   You may have heard about other Ginsu knives, but this is the original    
Ginsu knife that cuts through Ginsus faster than prunes through a rooster.  
Now, how much would you think all this would cost?  
Not six hundred dollars, not a hundred dollars, but nineteen-ninety-five if you 
order before February twenty-first.
