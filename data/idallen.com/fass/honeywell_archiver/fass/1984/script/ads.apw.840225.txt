Hello, I, Suzanne Suzannabanana, am here to talk to you about personal hygiene. 
You've prawbly never seen a real live celebrity like me, Suzanne Suzannabanana  
talking about these things but believe me, hygiene can be really important. 
Like the other week I, Suzanne Suzannabanana, went on a date with a 
guy named Richard Feeder from New Jersey.  So I went to my apartment and I  
washed and I put on my clean clothes and I made myself just so cute that I  
almost couldn't stand it and I waited for this guy to show up.  
.ti +5  
Well, he finally shows up and we go out in his car, which prawbly wasn't
his car but he borrowed it from somebody and as soon as we get in the car I 

start to notice it. 
Something smells bad.   
So we're ridin' along and I don't wanna 
say nothin' cause this guy is takin' me out to dinner and a movie   
which we never got to because I was sitting there in his car, and he was just   
a talkin' away like he wasn't noticin' nothing and I was looking around for 
whatever smelled bad.   
.ti +5  
So the first thing I do is I lift my arms real subtle like and checked my   
armpits just to make sure that my deodorant hadn't burned out but I was still   
as fresh.   
So I knew it had to be him. 
So I, Suzanne Suzannabanana, was sitting
there and the smell was getting worse and worse until I figured that maybe  
this guy, Richard Feeder from New Jersey, had a dead animal in his clothes. 
I couldn't stand it.
So finally he tells me again that he's from New Jersey and I said to
him, "If you're from New Jersey, how come you smell like you're from Guelph?"   
.ti +5  
So it just goes to show you -- personal hygiene is important so that people 
won't think you're from Guelph.
