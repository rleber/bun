Idea for song (seeing as 'tis the season to storm brains).  
To the tune of "If I Had a Hammer" (despicable bumpkin folk song)   
---> Note! this requires a suitably mad scientist to sing.  
     He is deploring the lack of funding which has prevented him
     from procuring a CAT scanner for his mad scientist laboratory. 
... 
If I had a scanner  
I'd scan 'er in the morning       [ lurid glance at maiden on table ]   
I'd scan 'er in the evening 
All over this lab...
... 
And so on, I forget the rest of the real words...
