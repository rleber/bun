WE SEE DAN KEW, R.B. LUST AND CLAUDE TODEATH THERE.  ALL THREE ARE DRESSED  
AS MERCENARIES AND LOOK EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE.  R.B. IS CARRYING A SUBMACHINE 
GUN, DAN HAS A KNIFE AND A RIFLE, AND CLAUDE IS CARRYING EVERY OTHER WEAPON 
THAT PROPS CAN COME UP WITH:  GUNS, KNIVES, SLINGSHOTS, KLINGON WAR DILDOES,
BROKEN BOTTLES, A LAWN CHAIR (JUST BECAUSE), AMMO BELTS, MAP CASES, BINOCULARS, 
AND MORE.  A BAZOOKA WOULD BE NICE.  HE CAN BARELY MOVE.)   
.ch cl  
M'sieur, I do not wish to complain, since you are paying me to be your native   
bearer, but it seems to me that this is, how you say, a silly idea. 
Anyone can see that you are not mercenaries.

Oh, yeah?  Watch this.

(DAN BEGINS A SERIES OF FAKE MOVES, TRYING HIS BEST TO BE A COOL, VICIOUS   
MERCENARY.  FIRST HE FEINTS, THEN HE STANDS, STARING AND SNEERING AT AN 
UNSEEN ENEMY.  HE STARTS PASSING THE KNIFE BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN HANDS.
THEN HE BEGINS MOCK ATTACKS AGAIN.  THE OTHERS WATCH HIM FOR A MOMENT AND   
THEN CARRY ON WITH THEIR CONVERSATION.)

Look, Claude, I'll explain this just once for you and that guy in the fourth
seat in the third row who went to the bathroom. 
We're pretty sure that the rebels have taken Mary and the rest to their 
headquarters.   
We should be able to get the location of their headquarters here.   
(REASSURING) And don't worry about us; we've been in some pretty tough  
places and come out alive.

THEN SHE COMES OVER.  ARMAND, FURTHER UPSTAGE, NOTICES THIS.)   
.ch da  
Hi, sweetheart, I'm a mercenary and a Virgo.  I'm a modern guy, I believe   
in women's lib. 
I think women should be allowed to kill, just like men. 
I have my own apartment, I'm rough and I'm tough, but most important of all,
I'm strong enough to be vulnerable. 
I go to encounter sessions. 
What say you and me talk for a few minutes, get to know each other and  
then go someplace for a meaningless sexual encounter?   
.ch jd  
Buenos noches, Virgo mercenary.  My name is Juanita Drink, and I think that 
would be fine.

(DAN FALLS BACKWARDS.)  
.ch cl  
(TO DAN)  Do not trust this woman, M'sieur.  She has a certain je ne sais

.ch da  
(GETTING UP)  What does that mean?  
.ch cl  
Go out, but leave your wallet with friends. 
.ch da  
Are you realyy sure you're a friendly native bearer?
.ch cl  
Da, tovarisch.

What is your stand on prisoners?
.ch ar  
All other lands are our enemies.
.ch cl  
Oh.

Well, Armand, that's not strictly true.  You know that we have nothing  
formally against India.

(WITH INDIAN ACCENT)  Well it just so happens--

But Juanita, can we really overlook their political stand on the entire 

beef issue? 
.ch jd  
No, you're right.   
.ch cl  
(FRENCH AGAIN) Certainly not.

On the other hand, Armand, I consider your opinion of England far too   
harsh.  
.ch cl  
(COCKNEY ACCENT)  Crikey, there's been a bloody mistake here, you see-- 
.ch ml  
No, I agree with Armand.  England is too socialist.  And they do not pay
enough attention to the four basic food groups. 
Myself, I favour Albania.   
.ch cl

She doesn't in the least resemble a barracuda."

Except around the eyes. 
.ch da  
Can we accept it as said?   
.ch ar  
Let's have a vote on that.  
.ch jd  
I agree.  All right.  In favour?  Against?  Abstentions?

.ch ar  
It passes, six in favour, one against, one abstention.  
.ch rb

.ch ar  
Hold on, that was just the vote to see if we
would vote on it.  Now, all those in favour of accepting it as said--

Shouldn't it be by secret ballot?   
.ch ml  
He's right, you know.

But why?

Richard, ever since I was a little girl, I've looked up at the stars at 
night--I don't think I told you this when we were married.  
Did I?

If it has nothing to do with your desire to grind me into the ground, no.   
Go on.  
.ch wl  
I've looked up at the stars at night, and the....   
They look so beautiful that you feel that you can just reach out and    
touch them, shining diamonds in the night sky, and to me, they were 
the symbol of everything I never had, a poor girl growing up in Oshawa. 
.ch rb  
Oh, for God's sake, Wanda, you grew up in Montreal's Westmount Heights, 
and your parents had enough money to choke a tyrannosaurus.  God knows  
 your mother was on a first-name basis with some.   
.ch wl  
It looks good on a resume:  February 1984--August 1985, took over free  
world;  September through December, established control over iron   
curtain countries.  
.ch da  
Sounds like you'd be taking a tremendous Risk.  
.ch wl  
Well, it's not a Trivial Pursuit.   
.ch cl

enjoy it later. 
Right now, I have a world to conquer!   
.ch rb  
Wait!  You haven't told us the details of your plan!  (TO AUDIENCE)     
It's obligatory.  Otherwise, no one would know what was going on.   
And even that may not be enough to help.
