111-PPPRRROOOFFFEEESSSSSSOOORRR:   Good evening, class.  This course is FASSical
   Studies, or as some of my students last year  called  it:
   Hunks o' History.


   You all have the course outline in front of you (HOLDS UP
   PROGRAM). If you turn to page 3 you will see that 40%  of
   the  course  will  be  studied before the midterm and 30%
   afterwards. There is no final, and bribing the  professor
   is encouraged.   


   Call  me  old  fashioned  but I ask that you do not bring
   food or drinks to lectures as I  find  them  distracting.














   The  same  can  be  said for cigarettes. Cameras and tape
   recorders are also forbidden, as the course is  available
   from  Correspondence already and I don't want to cut down
   on my royalty income.


   This course is an examination of the creation and  evolu-
   tion of the University of Waterloo and its parallels with
   the  evolution  of  western  civilization,  if  the  term
   civilization  can  be  given  to  a society that includes
   engineering. 


   I will be making extensive use of  audio-visual  aids  in
   teaching  this  course.  I may also take advantage of the
   wide variety of experts on faculty by bringing  in  guest
   lecturers.   


   As time is short, let's get started right away, shall we?


(AT THIS POINT THE Professor CAN EITHER INTRODUCE SCENE OR A
GUEST LECTURER) 


   What is it that separates man from the rest of the animal
   kingdom?   There  are many answers to that question. Some
   say it is man's interest in the arts.  I  believe  it  is
   man's  intellect. Intelligence is one of the paradoxes of
   our evolution. Knowledge threw us out of  the  Garden  of















   Eden,  yet  knowledge is what lets us enter a university.
   In this first lecture  I  will  show  how  man  developed
   language  and,  as a result, became the grand creature he
   was destined to be!

111-PPPRRROOOFFFEEESSSSSSOOORRR:  Tonight we are lucky enough to have  the  per-
   fect  person  to  introduce  this scene.  The scene deals
   with inter-university rivalry, specifically Waterloo  and
   Laurier.   I  would  now like to introduce the person who















   has coached football at both universities, Tuffy Knight. 


222-TTTUUUFFFFFFYYY KKKNNNIIIGGGHHHTTT:  What will you  get  most  from  university?
   Certainly  you will gain knowledge from your classes, but
   I think your most lasting legacy will be the friends  you
   make  and  the  memories of the good times you had making
   them.  You will also find that you have a soft  spot  for
   your  alma  mater,  in  other words, school spirit.  I've
   coached football at both Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier and
   have   experienced   both  sides  of  this  great  inter-
   university rivalry.  I think this is a good thing.   This
   next  scene  will  explore  this  rivalry  with  Waterloo
   represented by Troy and Laurier by Athens.

   the ages with Laurier usually coming out  on  top.   This
   year,  however, was different as our Warriors of Waterloo
   won the fight 7-6  with  a  grand  and  glorious  effort.

   The  Dark  Ages were characterised by great ignorance and
   nothing very important happening.

   sorry, that should be the Middle Ages.   In  these  times
   the  university  was becoming more structured. At the top
   of the hierarchy was the President. He was paid homage by
   the  Deans  who  in turn were serviced by the -- Im sorry
   that should be served--  by  the  professors  and  lesser
   academia.   At the bottom of the scale were the students.
   Or,  to  put  it  another   way,   undergraduates   under
   graduates.

   tenberg, the time of Shakespeare.  My next guest lecturer
   is discribed as 'unique' and 'an  individual',  from  the
   department of English:  Dr. Rota Lister. 


222-RRROOOTTTAAA LLLIIISSSTTTEEERRR:   Yes,  of  course, tonight we improvise.  My
   old teacher  at  the  University  of  Toronto,  the  late
   Canadian  guru  Marshall  McLuhan,  breathed hot and cool
   about Guttenberg and his press, his Galaxy.  What a star-
   tossed  venture!   When  I  was a graduate student in his
   seminar at the Centre for Culture  and  Communication,  I
   knew  what  an  enviroment  was!  And an anti-enviroment!
   But now it's not nearly  so  clear  any  more.   Was  the
   medium  really  a  message, or was it just inter-galactic
   graffiti done by a Renaissance buccaneers?   Did  Gutten-
   berg  reallly  invent movable type or was he just a front
   for a Machiavellian plot to dislocate the  monarchies  of
   the  time,  to  get  all  those dumb plebeians to run for
   elected office?  


   But Mac, of course, knew that the real  media  revolution




   was  an  electronic  one, that Marconi and Wiener and all
   the rest gave us all such a bums' rush that nowadays even
   a  University  campus  has  to have at least two hot/cool
   tabloids to keep us from losing  touch  with  the  Global
   Village.   So  here we are, witnesses to the MacLunacy of
   the Gazette and Imprint, as we observe the  commotion  in
   the  Imprint  office before they put the paper to bed for
   their Friday deadline.

   place for learning, the university is a place  to  relax,
   to  be  entertained  and  to  mature into fine upstanding
   human beings. Because of this, at  least  one  university
   set up a faculty of Human Kinetics and Leisure Studies to
   examine students at rest and students in  motion,  or  to
   put  it  more  succinctly, students in bed. In the 1700's
   they had the moves and didn't need the rest, as we  shall
   soon see.

111-PPPRRROOOFFFEEESSSSSSOOORRR:   We  now jump to an era when society attempted
   to enforce morality on the  university  campus.   In  the
   1920's  Prohibition  was  declared.  As we all know, when
   something is banned there is automatically  a  source  of
   income  in suppling that thing illicitly. Organised crime
   set up speakeasies to quench the thirst  of  the  public.
   The  universities  did  not  escape the gangland violence
   that soon followed. At Waterloo the speakeay  was  in  an
   old  farmhouse  on  a  hill  and  the gang was called the
   Mathia.

   the  future of universities in general and the University
   of Waterloo in particular. We've  all  seen  the  trends:
   funding  cutbacks,  a  more  conservative  student  body,
   rising stereo prices. How will the universities of  today
