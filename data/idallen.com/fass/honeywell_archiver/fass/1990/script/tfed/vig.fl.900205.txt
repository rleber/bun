111-PPPRRROOOFFFEEESSSSSSOOORRR:   Good evening, class.  This course is FASSical
   Studies, or as some of my students last year  called  it:
   Hunks o' History.


   You all have the course outline in front of you (HOLDS UP
   PROGRAM). If you turn to page 3 you will see that 40%  of
   the  course  will  be  studied before the midterm and 30%
   afterwards. There is no final, and bribing the  professor
   is encouraged.   


   Call  me  old  fashioned  but I ask that you do not bring
   food or drinks to lectures as I  find  them  distracting.














   The  same  can  be  said for cigarettes. Cameras and tape
   recorders are also forbidden, as the course is  available
   from  Correspondence already and I don't want to cut down
   on my royalty income.


   This course is an examination of the creation and  evolu-
   tion of the University of Waterloo and its parallels with
   the  evolution  of  western  civilization,  if  the  term
   civilization  can  be  given  to  a society that includes
   engineering. 


   I will be making extensive use of  audio-visual  aids  in
   teaching  this  course.  I may also take advantage of the
   wide variety of experts on faculty by bringing  in  guest
   lecturers.   


   As time is short, let's get started right away, shall we?


   What is it that separates man from the rest of the animal
   kingdom?  There are many answers to that  question.  Some
   say  it  is  man's  interest in the arts. I believe it is
   man's intellect. Intelligence is one of the paradoxes  of
   our  evolution.  Knowledge  threw us out of the Garden of
   Eden, yet knowledge is what lets us enter  a  university.
   In  this  first  lecture  I  will  show how man developed






   language and, as a result, became the grand  creature  he
   was destined to be!

111-PPPRRROOOFFFEEESSSSSSOOORRR:    Thus  the  first  of  the  universities  was
   founded. In their early years universities  were  violent
   and  self-serving places. "Every man for himself" was the
   prevalent attitude. People thought  nothing  of  stabbing
   colleagues  in the back and taking credit for their work.
   Come to think of it, not much has changed.   And  it  all
   seems  rather  silly,  doesn't  it, when you realize that
   university politics are so vicious because the stakes are






   so  small. Now, the fighting was not restricted to within
   the campus. Universities fought each other on  the  field
   of  battle.   Again  not much has changed except that the
   war is now fought on the  football  field.   One  of  the
   Great  Wars  was fought between Troy and Athens, or as we
   know them today, Waterloo and Wilfrid  Laurier.   Let  us
   take a look at the causes of this epic struggle.

4-PROFESSOR:  For the next lecture I would like to introduce
   Dr.  Phil Eastman from the Physics Department.  Dr. East-
   man is a longtime supporter of FASSical  Studies  and  we
   are honoured by his presence tonight.


555-PPPHHHIIILLL EEEAAASSSTTTMMMAAANNN:   Arthur  C.  Clarke,  an  author of several
   science type books, once said, "any sufficiently advanced
   science is indistinguishable from magic." I guess this is
   why I was asked to give the lecture on Merlin,  King  Ar-







   thur  and  the  Round Table.  I approached this task with
   trepidation until I realized that the corollary  of  that
   statement  is  also  true.   In  those  days, science was
   simply sufficiently advanced magic.  While much had  been
   lost  in the Dark Ages (misplaced in the dark, I suppose)
   it was all being rediscovered.  It must have been an  ex-
   citing  time.  Universities were gaining more stucture as
   an academic hierarchy developed to parallel the nobility:
   deans  and professors on top, under-graduates on the bot-
   tom or to  put  it  another  way,  under-graduates  under
   graduates.   Here,  now,  a typical day in the Faculty of
   Science, sorry, Magic.

111-PPPRRROOOFFFEEESSSSSSOOORRR:   One  of  the great achievements of man is the
   ability to communicate ideas in many ways:  art,  poetry,
   and  language.   The  Renaissance  was a rebirth of these
   forms of expression, which  is  why,  I  suppose,  it  is
   called the Renaissance.  


   A  vital  focus  of  student  life  came to be the campus
   newspaper, giving students a voice through which  to  ex-
   press  their  concerns. This tradition reached its zenith
   during  the  Renaissance  when  the  beauty  of  language
   bloomed  in  its fullest flower. There existed one campus
   blessed with two  such  journals,  the  Imprint  and  the
   Gazette, two papers both alike in infamy. We observe here
   the doings of the Imprint office  on  a  hectic  Thursday
   before their Friday deadline.

   from the Faculty of Science.  When I was approached about
   taking part in FASS this year, I asked if the scene I was
   introducing  had anything to do with my field: chemistry.













   I was told, and I quote, "well, yes, it's bio-chemistry".
   I  guess  it depends on your definition of bio-chemisrty.
   This scene deals with student life,  you  know,  the  boy
   meets girl type of biochemistry.  As my student days hap-
   pened over... ten... years ago I don't feel I  have  much
   to  add  to  the  discussion.   So,  here now, the Campus
   Centre as it was in the late 1700's.

222-AAALLLEEEXXX KKKOOORRRDDDIIICCCSSS:  We now jump to  an  era  when  society  at-
   tempted to enforce morality on the university campus.  In
   the 1920's Prohibition was declared. As we all know, when
   something  is  banned  there is automatically a source of
   income in suppling that thing illicitly. Organised  crime
   set  up  speakeasies  to quench the thirst of the public.
   The universities did not  escape  the  gangland  violence
   that  soon  followed. At Waterloo the speakeay was in the
   Grad Club and the gang was called the Mathia.

   the future of universities in general and the  University

   of  Waterloo  in particular.  In order to do this, I have
   asked an ancient professor from the Faculty of Science to
   address  you.   Unfortunalty,  he  has  to  be in Germany
   tonight, so with a little help from  Audio-Visual:   Bill
   Pearson. 


555-BBBIIILLLLLL PPPEEEAAARRRSSSOOONNN:   That's better.  When I was a young prof, I
   couldn't afford the good stuff.  I  had  to  drink  beer,
   Australian stuff.  Naah, not that Fosters.  It was called
   Boomerang, because it always kept coming back to you.


   Oh fish, poor fish, alone in your bowl   


666-VVVOOOIIICCCEEE:  Excuse me, this is FASS '90, not FASS  '78.   Next
   page in the script.  


7-PEARSON:   Good  evening.  While  science fiction has very
   little to  do  with  science,  I  have  always  liked  to
   speculate  on  the  future.  What new advances will tech-
   nology bring us?  Will we reach the stars?  If  so,  will
   we  arrive  in time to appologize for all those reruns of
   "Gilligan's Island"?  Will scientists find a cheap way to
   turn  gold  into  lead for our space age batteries?  Will















   they tell anyone?  The University  will  be  affected  by
   these  discoveries, but many forces will remain the same,
   economics  and  politics  for  example.   What  will  the
   University of Waterloo be like in the years to come?  And
   why am I asking so many questions?  That's _y_o_u_r job.
