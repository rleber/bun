(THE SCENE OPENS WITH A CROWD IN FRONT OF A BACKDROP OF  THE

DAVIS CENTRE WITH A NUMBER OF FUTURISTIC BUILDINGS BEHIND IT
(A LA 'JETSONS').  IN FRONT OF THIS IS A PODIUM AND A  LARGE
SET PIECE UNDER A COVER. A REPORTER DRESSED LIKE ROBIN LEECH
IS STANDING  TO  ONE  SIDE.   PEOPLE  AMONG  THE  CROWD  ARE
CARRYING  PLACARDS  THAT  ARE NOT VISIBLE YET. NEXT TO The 3
Larrys, ALL OF WHOM THINK THEY ARE THE  ORIGINAL  LARRY  AND
THE OTHERS ARE CLONES, IS Janet, AN ATTRACTIVE ANDROID)

   of the Rich and Humanoid' here in  Waterloo,  where  poor
   students are out to make it rich with a degree from these
   nouveau Ivy League halls of champagne riches  and  caviar
   dreams  at  the  University  of  Waterloo.   Today, we're
   coming to you live from outside the  oldest  building  on
   campus,   the  William  G.  Davis  Centre  for  Computing
   Research.  Behind me, you can see the disintegrator beams
   flashing as the old Math and Computer Science building is
   being leveled to make room for the  interstellar  shuttle
   garage  of  this  magnificent monument to the opulence of















   those who control and spend the  massive  tuitions  these
   students  pay.  But  all is not happy in this never-never
   land of higher learning as you'll soon see.

   population is against it!

5-ROBIN(2):   (WANDERS UP TO Louie) Can you tell our viewers
   exactly what it is that you are protesting?  


6-VALERIE(2):  Every year they destroy more of our  hallowed
   halls of learning.

7-LOUIE(2):  And they're using our money to do it!  


8-LARRYS(2):   I  lost  my  locker. (TO OTHER Larrys) No, my
   locker.  


9-LOUIE(3):  We can no longer afford  the  costs  of  higher
   learning!







10-VALERIE(3):  The quality of our education is plunging!   


11-LARRYS(3):   Yup.  I  already  forgot  my  locker  combo.
   (INDICATES OTHER Larrys) So did they.


12-VALERIE(4):  It's a sin. We can't even spell correctly.  


(PLACARDS ARE SHOWN TO THE AUDIENCE. SUGGESTIONS  FOR  THESE
INCLUDE  'RAIZ A CHEER WEER ENGINEERZ', 'HAV A HART SAYV THE
ARTS', 'DONT REK REC',  'WEEL  FITE  4  MATHS  TO  THE  VERY
LASTH'.  THE Larrys MAY HOLD SIGNS SAYING 'WHAT HE SAYS', OR
PERHAPS 'CORECKTLY')


13-LOUIE(4):  It's not too late for the  university,  but  I
   estimate that we have only 12.1 minutes left.


14-VALERIE(5):   (CHANTS)  We  want  to learn! Don't let our
   buildings burn!  


(OTHER PROTESTERS JOIN IN THE CHANT)


15-ROBIN(3):  As you can see, changes  to  this  institution
   have inspired some emotional outcry from the rambunctious
   radicals among the university population. Let's talk  now
   with  some  of these anxious anarchists. (GOES UP TO Lar-
   rys) Excuse me, can you tell our numerous  and  vicarious
   viewers who you might be?


16-LARRYS(4):   Hi.  I'm  Larry, this is my clone Larry, and
   this is my other clone Larry.



17-ROBIN(4):  How unusual. And just how did you manage  such
   a fascinating replication?   


18-LARRYS(5):   Well,  I  was  a test subject for a graduate
   biohumanoid engineering  project.  They  were  trying  to
   triple my virility, and things got out of hand.  


19-ROBIN(5):  And the operation - operations were a complete
   success? 


222000-JJJAAANNNEEETTT WWWAAATTTTTT(111):   Affirmative.  No  humanoids  have   ever
   popped my stack like these three.


21-ROBIN(6):   And  who  might  this  voluptuous  vision  of
   silicon circuitry be?

22-JANET(2):   I am known as Janet.  I spend most of my time
   having my server accessed.  I have had many  accounts  on
   my  network,  but  Larrys  may advance to the first queue
   position anytime.


23-ROBIN(7):  Aren't  you  worried  about  overloading  your
   system due to its extended duty cycle?   


24-JANET(3):   Sex  between  two  sentients  is  a beautiful









   thing. With four, it is fantastic!   


(AT THIS MOMENT A MAN IN A BUSINESS SUIT, A  MAN  IN  A  LAB
COAT, AND ED-209 ENTER. AS THEY CLIMB THE STEPS OF THE SMALL
PODIUM AT THE BACK OF THE CROWD,  THE  PROTESTERS  BEGIN  TO
JEER AT THEM)   


25-VALERIE(6):   There's  the chief criminal himself, Presi-
   dent Peace!  


26-LARRYS(6):  Maim him.  Torture him.  Kill him!

   something to say!


222888-EEE.DDD.-222000999(111):  Silence!

31-LOUIE(5):  Death to the demolitionists!  


(ED-209 PRODUCES A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF ARMAMENT ) 


32-E.D.-209(2):  Drop that illegal placard, perpetrator. You
   have   ten   seconds   to   comply!  Ten...nine...eight..

ALONE IN HIS SECTION OF THE STAGE)

35-WESTON(3):  Oh dear. I hate it when that happens.



(A COUPLE OF PROTESTORS REVIVE Louie)   


   Now, I know many of you are somewhat disturbed (PAUSE) at
   the  dismantling  of our campus computer systems. The sad
   truth is, it was necessary. U  W's  computing  facilities
   have  become  infected with a number of powerful computer
   viruses. This campus is infested with S.T.D's!   


(CROWD GASPS)   


36-ROBIN(8):  So there you have it. For the  first  time  on
   Holovision,  a  public  admission  that  Waterloo  has  a
   serious  problem  with  S.T.D.'s:    System   transmitted
   diseases,   deadly   computer  viruses  which  have  been
   spreading across the globe in epidemic proportions.  


37-WESTON(4):  You have only yourselves to blame. We  warned
   you  to  practice  safe computing. Don't you realize that
   when you interface with a computer, you  are  interfacing
   with  every computer it has ever interfaced with? We even
   provided you with latex modems, but still you  hack  away
   and log onto the first available terminal!   


(CROWD LOOKS AT GROUND, MUTTERING APRICOTS AND RUTABAGAS)   


   Undaunted, the administration has come up with a replace-







   ment system.  Members of the University community, I give
   you WAT-MEGA-SYS-1!

   To explain to you the revolutionary aspects of this crea-
   tion, I now introduce to you Doctor Off. 


333888-DDDRRR. HHHAAANNNSSS OOOFFFFFF(111):   Zank  you, Herr Peace.  WAT-MEGA-SYS-1
   is not just a collection of circuits and chips; it is the
   next  step  in  human evolution. It contains within it an
   actual human BRAIN!  (AT THE MENTION OF THE WORD  "BRAIN"
   Doctor Off TAKES ON THE LOOK OF AN UTTER MADMAN)

   RHUBARB) 


40-DR. OFF(2):  As you know, Herr President  Peace  replaced






   one  of  the best men this university has ever had. Since
   his predecessor donated his BRAIN to science,  he  was  a
   natural  candidate  for  this  experiment.   I  give  you
   Douglas Wright's BRAIN!  


(Doctor Off LAUGHS MANIACALLY AS THE LIGHT IS TURNED  ON  IN
THE  DOME  TO REVEAL A BRAIN. POSSIBLY USE A LIGHT BULB OVER

   yuck!(RHUBARB RHUBARB)   


42-DR. OFF(3):  Yes children. Zis is ze culmination of years
   of BRAIN research. Not only will it replace all  existing
   computing  facilities,  it  will also remove the need for
   professors to teach their classes.  With  WAT-MEGA-SYS-1,
   knowledge  can be directly transferred into the student's
   BRAIN in this, the WAT-BRAIN induction booth! (POINTS  TO
   BOOTH)   


43-VALERIE(7):  You're mad! 


44-LOUIE(7):  You're insane!


45-LARRYS(8):  And your mother dresses you funny.   


46-DR. OFF(4):   You  stubborn little children! You will not
   be so dissenting once you see WAT-MEGA-SYS-1 in action! I






   have found a...volunteer for a demonstration.

   I'd find my Mr. (W)Right?


48-DR. OFF(5):  This is Marsha, a miserably  happy  creature
   whose  BRAIN  has  been  wasted. But we shall now rectify
   this situation. (MOVES  TOWARDS  Marsha)  Step  into  the

   use matrix algebra  in  refining  some  of  the  laws  of
   genetic  inheritance; but at the same time, like, I wanna
   go shopping. 


50-WESTON(5):  She seems unstable.
