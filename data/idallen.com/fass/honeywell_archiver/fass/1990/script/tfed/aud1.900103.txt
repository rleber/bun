111-DDDRRR. ZZZEEEUUUSSS: 


   I did not wish to zap or zop.
   I only wish this war to stop.
   My name is Zeuss, but call me Doc.   
   I have the floor, so let me talk.


   Could all you Greeks, and all you Troys  
   Please try to be good girls and boys.
   Learn to share each other's toys.
   And don't make such an awful noise!

   belied, maggot sucking deformed excuse for a  sewer  rat!
   You  treat  me  like an object and then expect me to like
   it? At least from sheep-boy here, I get love and respect.
   Actually,  he's  kind  of  cute, once you get used to the
   smell.   


5-DR. ZEUS: 


   You little kids are much too gruff.  
   Now listen here: I've had enough!


   Helen hides at Waterloo, 
   Fleeing Athen's sexist zoo   
   You'll fight until you're black and blue 
   Let her decide what SHE should do !  


6-MENEPAUS:  But Dr. Zeus...


7-DR. ZEUS: 


   Hold your tongue 'til I am done  
   A million volts is NOT much fun !

   I've thunk deep thoughts, and plumbed my mind,   
   Dredged through this muck, and so I find:
   My wicked wilful wanton wifey,   
   With Athene and Aphrodite,   
   Caused this whole Kabob-kerflapple,  
   Just to claim some stupid apple! 


(ENTER Athena, Hera AND Aphrodite, SHAMEFACEDLY.)   




   Say "Sorry" now, to them and me, 
   Before my bolts go snicker-snee. 


(THE GODDESSES MUMBLE APOLOGIES.)   




   Go to your rooms!


(GODDESSES EXIT, WHINING.)  




   Greeks, your motives full of greed   
   Ire me most: get lost, with speed.   


(GREEKS LEAVE, GRUMBLING.)  




   Helen, you lovely blushing flower,   
   Take care of Paris... and make him shower!   
   These Trojan boys who bothered me,   
   Will not escape from this scot free  
   This curse will balance your good luck:  
   Your campus will be plagued with ducks!
