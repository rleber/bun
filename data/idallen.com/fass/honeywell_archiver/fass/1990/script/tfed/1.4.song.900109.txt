   SINGER 1:
   You crawl to campus Monday, start a week of drudgery 
   You suffer through your classes  
             and it passes oh so awfully slow   
   (Sing it, child) But when Friday's here: 


   CHORUS              SINGER 2 
   ======              ======== 
   Pick up an Imprint  That's the campus rag
   Grab an Imprint     Now, I don't like to brag
   Read the Imprint    And your spirit's sagging no more
                       See what's in store. 
   See what's in store  
   (SINGER OPENS EDITORIAL PAGE.)   
   Inside the Imprint  Editorial rebuke 
   Imprint             Of a letter from some kook   
   Imprint             It's enough to make you puke just to see 
                                 this travesty. 








   IMPRINT SCRIBES & WRITERS:   
   Advertisements are printed from a strippers' joint   
   Our readers are complaining that we missed the point 
   They say the press's freedom only goes so far
   But Huggy's is our favourite bar!


   CHORUS             SINGER 3  
   ======             ========  
                      It says here (REFERRING TO THE FRONT PAGE)
   Imprint            Leather school jacket thief   
   Imprint            Brings a Fed Hall patron grief
   Imprint            It's beyond belief what we choose 
                                as front-page news. 
   As front page news   We can't excuse 
   We can't excuse      Our arts reviews
   Our arts reviews 
                      BOTH:  But here's some clues: 
                      ===== 
   COLONORANUS: 
   Arts!  That's the section dear to our hearts 
   Where the whole is less than the parts   
   If you'd like to hear how it starts  
   I take my favourite disc 
   Say very little 'bout music, and lots about me   
   There is no risk 
   Because the chance that you've heard of the group
             is so frightfully slim 
   You'll ignore my review cause the headline's 







             so grim after all.

   CHORUS             COLONORANUS   
   ======             ===========   
                      And so I  
   Imprint            Attach a morbid photograph
   Imprint            A favourite trick of Imprint staff
   Imprint            And sprinkle round some pointless graphics
                                to boot - we think it's cute.   
   ROMEO:   
   How I start to regret my all-nighters here   
   Rue the day when I met the back-biters here  
   Gee, I wish we could get some real writers here  
   Wish my own Juliet could be right here.  


   (CHORUS 1 & 2 ARE COUNTER-POINTED)   


   CHORUS 1: Imprint! We only print the truth.  
   CHORUS 2: Are we professional?  Yes, we believe in it


   CHORUS 1: Imprint! Every journalistic sleuth.
   CHORUS 2: But it's anyone's guess who's achievin' it 


   CHORUS 1: Imprint! Still, we lack a little couth 
   CHORUS 2: If there's a God of the Press, we're deceivin' it  


   CHORUS 1: even so!   
   CHORUS 2: A great career long as you're not naive in it  


   CHORUS 1: Imprint!   





   CHORUS 2: If you miss the allure we perceive in it   


   CHORUS 1: Imprint!   
   CHORUS 2: Just think of all of the perks we receive in it


   CHORUS 1: Imprint!   
   CHORUS 2: But I wish all these jerks would start 
                        leavin' it, oh!
