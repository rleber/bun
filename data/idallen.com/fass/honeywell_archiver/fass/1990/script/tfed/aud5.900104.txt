111-RRROOOBBBIIINNN FFFLLLAAATTTWWWOOORRRMMM:  This is Robin Flatworm for 'Lifestyles of
   the Rich and Humanoid' here in Waterloo, home of the very
   ignorant student out to make it rich with a  degree  from
   these  nouveau  Ivy  League halls of champagne riches and
   caviar dreams at  the  University  of  Waterloo.   Today,
   we're coming to you live from outside the oldest building
   on campus, the William  G.  Davis  Centre  for  Computing
   Research.  Behind me, you can see the disintegrator beams
   flashing as the old Math and Computer Science building is












   being  leveled  to make room for the interstellar shuttle
   garage of this magnificent monument to  the  opulence  of
   those  who  control  and spend the massive tuitions these
   students pay. But all is not happy  in  this  never-never
   land of higher learning as you'll soon see.  


222-DDDRRR. HHHAAANNNSSS OOOFFFFFF:  Zank you, Herr Flatworm.  WAT-MEGA-SYS-1 is
   not just a collection of circuits and chips;  it  is  the
   next  step  in  human evolution. It contains within it an
   actual human BRAIN!  (AT THE MENTION OF THE WORD  "BRAIN"
   Doctor Off TAKES ON THE LOOK OF AN UTTER MADMAN) 


   As  you  know,  Herr  President Peace replaced one of the
   best  men  this  university  has  ever  had.  Since   his
   predecessor  donated  his  BRAIN  to  science,  he  was a
   natural  candidate  for  this  experiment.   I  give  you
   Douglas Wright's BRAIN!  


(Doctor Off LAUGHS MANIACALLY AS HE REVEALS THE MACHINE)


   Yes,  mein  Herr. Zis is ze culmination of years of BRAIN
   research. Not only will it replace all existing computing
   facilities,  it  will also remove the need for professors











   to teach their classes.  With  WAT-MEGA-SYS-1,  knowledge
   can  be  directly transferred into the student's BRAIN in
   this, the WAT-BRAIN induction booth! 


3-ROBIN:  This is incredible! Sentients of the  galaxy,  the
   brain  of  former university president Douglas Wright has
   been brought back to life before our eyes!  And remember,
   dreamers,  you  saw  this  magic  moment  happen  here on
   'Lifestyles of the Rich and Humanoid.'
