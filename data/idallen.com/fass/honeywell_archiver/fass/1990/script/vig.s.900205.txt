.ch pro 
Good evening, class.    
This course is FASSical Studies, or as some of my students last year
called it: Hunks o' History.
.ex 
You all have the course outline in front of you (HOLDS UP   
PROGRAM). If you turn to page 3 you will see that 40% of
the course will be studied before the midterm and 30%   
afterwards. There is no final, and bribing the professor
is encouraged.  
.ex 
Call me old fashioned but I ask that you do not bring   
food or drinks to lectures as I find them distracting.  
The same can be said for cigarettes. Cameras and tape   
recorders are also forbidden, as the course is available
from Correspondence already and I don't want to cut down
on my royalty income.   
.ex 
This course is an examination of the creation and evolu-
tion of the University of Waterloo and its parallels with   
the evolution of western civilization, if the term  
civilization can be given to a society that includes
engineering.
.ex 
I will be making extensive use of audio-visual aids in  
teaching this course. I may also take advantage of the  
wide variety of experts on faculty by bringing in guest 
lecturers.  
.ex 
As time is short, let's get started right away, shall we?

(AT THIS POINT THE Professor CAN EITHER INTRODUCE SCENE OR A
GUEST LECTURER) 
.ex 
What is it that separates man from the rest of the animal   
kingdom?  There are many answers to that question. Some 
say it is man's interest in the arts. I believe it is   
man's intellect. Intelligence is one of the paradoxes of
our evolution. Knowledge threw us out of the Garden of  
Eden, yet knowledge is what lets us enter a university. 
In this first lecture I will show how man developed 
language and, as a result, became the grand creature he 
was destined to be!

Tonight we are lucky enough to have the perfect person  
to introduce this scene.
The scene deals with inter-university rivalry,  
specifically Waterloo and Laurier.  
I would now like to introduce the person who
has coached football at both universities, Tuffy Knight.
.ch tuf 
What will you get most from university? 
Certainly you will gain knowledge from your classes,
but I think your most lasting legacy will   
be the friends you make and the memories of the good
times you had making them.  
You will also find that you have a soft spot for
your alma mater, in other words, school spirit. 
I've coached football at both Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier  
and have experienced both sides of this great inter-university  
rivalry.
I think this is a good thing.   
This next scene will explore this rivalry with Waterloo 
represented by Troy and Laurier by Athens.

As we know the struggle has continued through   
the ages with Laurier usually coming out on top.  This  
year, however, was different as our Warriors of Waterloo
won the fight 7-6 with a grand and glorious effort. 
WARRRRR-I-IORS!!!

We now enter middle age, (PUTS ON GLASSES) I'm  
sorry, that should be the Middle Ages.  In these times  
the university was becoming more structured. At the top 
of the hierarchy was the President. He was paid homage  
by the Deans who in turn were serviced by the -- Im sorry   
that should be served-- by the professors and lesser
academia.  At the bottom of the scale were the students.
Or, to put it another way, undergraduates under graduates.

We now reach the Renaissance, the time of Guttenberg,   
the time of Shakespeare.
My next guest lecturer is discribed as 'unique' 
and 'an individual', from the department of English:
Dr. Rota Lister.
.ch list
Yes, of course, tonight we improvise.   
My old teacher at the University of Toronto,
the late Canadian guru Marshall McLuhan,
breathed hot and cool about Guttenberg and his press,   
his Galaxy. 
What a star-tossed venture! 
When I was a graduate student in his seminar at the Centre  
for Culture and Communication,  
I knew what an enviroment was!  
And an anti-enviroment! 
But now it's not nearly so clear any more.  
Was the medium really a message,
or was it just inter-galactic graffiti done by a Renaissance
buccaneers? 
Did Guttenberg reallly invent movable type or was he just   
a front for a Machiavellian plot to dislocate the monarchies
of the time, to get all those dumb plebeians to run for 
elected office? 
.ex 
But Mac, of course, knew that the real media revolution 
was an electronic one, that Marconi and Wiener and all the rest 
gave us all such a bums' rush that nowadays even a University   
campus has to have at least two hot/cool tabloids to keep us
from losing touch with the Global Village.  
So here we are, witnesses to the MacLunacy of the   
Gazette and Imprint, as we observe the commotion
in the Imprint office before they put the paper to bed  
for their Friday deadline.

All right, as we are having a double lecture
tonight I think this is an appropriate time for a break.
We'll be starting again in 10 minutes. Please be prompt 
in returning.

Now, if we're all QUITE ready? As well as a 
place for learning, the university is a place to relax, 
to be entertained and to mature into fine upstanding
human beings. Because of this, at least one university  
set up a faculty of Human Kinetics and Leisure Studies to   
examine students at rest and students in motion, or to  
put it more succinctly, students in bed. In the 1700's  
they had the moves and didn't need the rest, as we shall
soon see.

We now jump to an era when society attempted
to enforce morality on the university campus.  In the   
1920's Prohibition was declared. As we all know, when   
something is banned there is automatically a source of  
income in suppling that thing illicitly. Organised crime
set up speakeasies to quench the thirst of the public.  
The universities did not escape the gangland violence   
that soon followed. At Waterloo the speakeay was in an  
old farmhouse on a hill and the gang was called the 
Mathia.

For this last lecture I would like to look at   
the future of universities in general and the University
of Waterloo in particular. We've all seen the trends:   
funding cutbacks, a more conservative student body, 
rising stereo prices. How will the universities of today
prepare for tomorrow? Here for you now is a speculative 
look at a possible future.
