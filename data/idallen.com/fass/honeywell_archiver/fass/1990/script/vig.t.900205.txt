Good evening, class.    
This course is FASSical Studies, or as some of my students last year
called it: Hunks o' History.
.ex 
You all have the course outline in front of you (HOLDS UP   
PROGRAM). If you turn to page 3 you will see that 40% of
the course will be studied before the midterm and 30%   
afterwards. There is no final, and bribing the professor
is encouraged.  
.ex 
Call me old fashioned but I ask that you do not bring   
food or drinks to lectures as I find them distracting.  
The same can be said for cigarettes. Cameras and tape   
recorders are also forbidden, as the course is available
from Correspondence already and I don't want to cut down
on my royalty income.   
.ex 
This course is an examination of the creation and evolu-
tion of the University of Waterloo and its parallels with   
the evolution of western civilization, if the term  
civilization can be given to a society that includes
engineering.
.ex 
I will be making extensive use of audio-visual aids in  
teaching this course. I may also take advantage of the  
wide variety of experts on faculty by bringing in guest 
lecturers.  
.ex 
As time is short, let's get started right away, shall we?

What is it that separates man from the rest of the animal   
kingdom?  There are many answers to that question. Some 
say it is man's interest in the arts. I believe it is   
man's intellect. Intelligence is one of the paradoxes of
our evolution. Knowledge threw us out of the Garden of  
Eden, yet knowledge is what lets us enter a university. 
In this first lecture I will show how man developed 
language and, as a result, became the grand creature he 
was destined to be!

Thus the first of the universities was  
founded. In their early years universities were violent 
and self-serving places. "Every man for himself" was the
prevalent attitude. People thought nothing of stabbing  
colleagues in the back and taking credit for their work.
Come to think of it, not much has changed.  And it all  
seems rather silly, doesn't it, when you realize that   
university politics are so vicious because the stakes are   
so small. Now, the fighting was not restricted to within
the campus. Universities fought each other on the field 
of battle.  Again not much has changed except that the  
war is now fought on the football field.  One of the
Great Wars was fought between Troy and Athens, or as we 
know them today, Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier.  Let us  
take a look at the causes of this epic struggle.

As we know the struggle has continued through   
the ages with Laurier usually coming out on top.  This  
year, however, was different as our Warriors of Waterloo
won the fight 7-6 with a grand and glorious effort.

We now enter middle age, (PUTS ON GLASSES) I'm  
sorry, that should be the Middle Ages.  In these times  
the university was becoming more structured. At the top 
of the hierarchy was the President. He was paid homage  
by the Deans who in turn were serviced by the -- Im sorry   
that should be served-- by the professors and lesser
academia.  At the bottom of the scale were the students.
Or, to put it another way, undergraduates under graduates.

One of the great achievements of man is the 
ability to communicate ideas in many ways: art, poetry, 
and language.  The Renaissance was a rebirth of these   
forms of expression, which is why, I suppose, it is 
called the Renaissance. 
.es 
A vital focus of student life came to be the campus 
newspaper, giving students a voice through which to ex- 
press their concerns. This tradition reached its zenith 
during the Renaissance when the beauty of language  
bloomed in its fullest flower. There existed one campus 
blessed with two such journals, the Imprint and the 
Gazette, two papers both alike in infamy. We observe
here the doings of the Imprint office on a hectic Thurs-
day before their Friday deadline.

All right, as we are having a double lecture
tonight I think this is an appropriate time for a break.
We'll be starting again in 10 minutes. Please be prompt 
in returning.

Now, if we're all QUITE ready? As well as a 
place for learning, the university is a place to relax, 
to be entertained and to mature into fine upstanding
human beings. Because of this, at least one university  
set up a faculty of Human Kinetics and Leisure Studies to   
examine students at rest and students in motion, or to  
put it more succinctly, students in bed. In the 1700's  
they had the moves and didn't need the rest, as we shall
soon see.

We now jump to an era when society attempted
to enforce morality on the university campus.  In the   
1920's Prohibition was declared. As we all know, when   
something is banned there is automatically a source of  
income in suppling that thing illicitly. Organised crime
set up speakeasies to quench the thirst of the public.  
The universities did not escape the gangland violence   
that soon followed. At Waterloo the speakeay was in an  
old farmhouse on a hill and the gang was called the 
Mathia.

For this last lecture I would like to look at   
the future of universities in general and the University
of Waterloo in particular. We've all seen the trends:   
funding cutbacks, a more conservative student body, 
rising stereo prices. How will the universities of today
prepare for tomorrow? Here for you now is a speculative 
look at a possible future.
