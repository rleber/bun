(THIS SET IS REMARKABLY LIKE THE FRONT ROOM OF THE GRAD CLUB, WITH THE  
BAR, ENTRANCE WAY, AND TABLES. ONE CORNER HAS HOWEVER BEEN SET UP TO
ACCOMODATE A SMALL BAND. AS THE SCENE OPENS, TWO BARTENDERS ARE VISIBLE.
THEY ARE Tom Collins
, A NOVICE BARTENDER WHO IS A COMBINATION OF TOM CRUISE (COCKTAIL) AND THE  
AIRHEAD ROOKIE PITCHER IN BULL DURHAM,  
AND Scott Sean D'Roques,    
WHO FULFILLS THE TWO COUNTERPOINT ROLES FROM COCKTAIL AND BULL DURHAM.  
Scott KNOWS ALL THE TRICKS, AND IS ATTEMPTING TO TEACH Tom HOW TO BE A  
GOOD BARTENDER.)

.ch sco 
Right, kid. I sense you've got talent, and with a bit of work, I know you   
can make it rich.   
.ch tc  
I don't know. I just can't make any of your tricks work.

(THE 5-MAN ECLECTICAL BAND IS A BAD BAND, WHICH CAN'T QUITE GET ITS ACT 
TOGETHER.  THEY ARE, HOWEVER, GOOD AT PLAYING THEIR INSTRUMENTS, ALTHOUGH NOT   
TOGETHER.  THE BAND MEMBERS ARE Harvey Naghila -- BAND LEADER, THE MOST NORMAL  
OF THE BAND, BUT A BIT OF A LOW-STATUS LOSER; Harpo C. Chord -- SOMEWHAT
AUTISTIC AND ONLY TALKS IN SONG FRAGMENTS; Tim Panni -- RHYTHM, A FAST-TALKING  
SALESMAN TYPE; Ritardo Montalban -- SARCASTIC AND RATHER DEPRECATING OF THE 
WORLD IN GENERAL; AND Paul E. Phonic -- A COOL-SCHOOL TYPE WHO TALKS IN 
SCAT-STYLE RHYTHMS.  THERE IS NO EFFECTIVE LEADERSHIP TO THE BAND, AND AS THEY  
PLAY ANYTHING, EACH OF THE MUSICIANS GRADUALLY DRIFTS OFF INTO PLAYING THE SONG 
IN THE STYLE HE/SHE LIKES BEST)

Remember prohibition. All we have is coffee.

.ch tom 
Okay, an American Coffee, a Scotch Coffee, and a Barley Sandwich.   
.ch cla 
Water, please, if it isn't too much trouble.
.ch tim 
Nothing for me, no sir. Alcohol is bad for your health; it rots out your
stomach, destroys the liver, and turns your brain to mush. Coffee   
contains caffeine which is a stimulant and I surely don't need that, and
the water around here sucks. Yes sir, no sir, I don't know how people can live  
in this part of the world: no oceans, no mountains, no lakes, too   
much rain, and I can see why some might turn to alcohol --

(GLARES AT T.C.) Guys, I think you what you need is 
something to keep you together. 
.ch arp 
Love, love will keep us together.   
.ch sco 
I was thinking of something more like a singer. Say a nice young lady to
sing the songs and provide an attractive front to the band. 
.ch tim 
What an idea! Take a bow, sir. You have just invented the band of   
the future. 
Henceforth, the world will be a changed place, as the concept of a band being   
something that plays music is replaced by background noise with a voluptuous
female clad in not very much strutting about the stage while all the males in   
the audience stare and drool.  What an idea. Why didn't I think of it?  
.ch tc  
I can think of a few reasons.   
.ad 
(Scott TAKES Tom TO ONE SIDE)   
.ch sco 
T.C., you need to work on your sympathy lines. People come to talk to   

a bartender for sympathy and free drinks. Sarcasm will only drive   
customers away. 
.ch tc  
No, really?!
.ch sco 
Now these are three lines that I like to use. Write them down...
One -- You've got to take things one day at a time. 
Two -- Women: can't live with them, can't live without them.
Three -- Do you walk to school, or do you take a lunch? 
That one really gets them thinking.

Yes. Unfortunately, I lost the envelope.

I have a plan.

(IGNORING Annette)  
So, what are we going to do?
.ch kate
Look, we've got to prove that the Mathia are associated with this club, 
and we need proof of spirits.   
.ch tsen
Yes of course, Annette. I guess the first thing we have to prove is that
the Mathia owns this joint. 
.ch sc  
And then we have to prove that illegal beverages are being sold in this 
place which rot the brain.  
.ch kate
And if we can establish those things, we can confiscate this club as part   
of their ill-gotten gains.  
.ch tsen
Who would want such a place, stuck out in the middle of this wasteland? 
.ch sc  
What this place needs is a waitress to serve us a beer with a beautiful 
body.
