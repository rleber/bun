   CHORUS:  


   Paris was a simple shepherd  
   Watching o'er his flock by night, he 
   Heard a call from Gods on high:  
   Athena, Hera, Aphrodite. 


   A task was given unto Paris, 
   A golden apple was the prize.






   To choose which Goddess was the fairest  
   (And) which one had the finest... thighs?


(Paris IS ONSTAGE WITH HIS SHEEP, Wool Rogers AND Fleece Ir-
kus.   ENTER  THE  THREE GODDESSES. Hera IS HOLDING A GOLDEN

6-ATHENA:  Not bad, fleece-breath.  How'd  you  figure  that


   out? 


7-PARIS:  I heard it through the Chorus Line.   


8-HERA:  Look, we've got this little disagreement. This gol-
   den apple is supposed to go to the fairest goddess. These
   two  upstarts dispute my obvious claim. My husband, Zeus,
   refused to get involved, so we had to find  a  mortal  --
   and you're it.   


(HANDS Paris THE APPLE) 


9-PARIS:  Eenie, Meenie, Minie...   


10-HERA:   Before  you decide, consider that I am Hera, god-
   dess  of  petty  intrigue  and  bureaucratic   authority.
   Choose  me,  and  you'll  never have another eight-thirty
   class.  No waiting at the  bookstore.  You  could  get  a
   degree without doing any homework!   


111111-WWWOOOOOOLLL RRROOOGGGEEERRRSSS:  Big deal. I got a degree.

13-WOOL:  Yeah! My B.A.A.   


14-ATHENA:   Out  of the way, you pinched-face power broker!
   The woman he chooses needs to have  great  brains  and  a
   nice tush!   


15-HERA:  Too bad yours are in the same spot!   


(Athena IGNORES THIS AND TURNS TO Paris)





16-ATHENA:   I  am  Athena,  goddess  of skill and strategy.
   Choose me, and I promise you success on  the  only  field
   that  counts: the field of battle.  I could make you into
   the Tough Knight that your team needs to win.


17-PARIS:  Sounds great.  After  all...  (CATCHES  SIGHT  OF

   true love.   


(Aphrodite GRABS Paris, DIPS  HIM  LOW.  LONG  KISS.  DAZED,
Paris GIVES Aphrodite THE APPLE)


19-ATHENA:  You will never score again! 


(Athena EXITS)  


20-HERA:  Kiss your OSAP goodbye.   


(Hera EXITS)


21-PARIS:  So, what happens now? Do we, like, Mount Olympus?


22-APHRODITE:  (LAUGHS) You misunderstand. The woman for you
   is in Athens, at the University known as Laurier. She  is
   the most beautiful mortal in the world: Miss Oktoberfest.

   His just reward for choosing love
   Can be found at Laurier. 
   She's everything he's dreaming of
   In every category... eh.

(A TOGA-CLAD CROWD IS ONSTAGE. Paris AND  THE  Sheep  ENTER.
Lorenzo, Darius AND Darius ARE ONSTAGE) 


222333-LLLOOORRREEENNNZZZOOO:   Hi. Welcome to Laurier.  I'm Lorenzo, and this
   is my brother Darius and this is my other brother Darius.
   We're here studying business in hopes of some day opening
   our very own restaurant, featuring an exciting variety of
   food animals.


24-PARIS:  That's nice. 


25-LORENZO:   Darius  here  has  even  picked out our little
   bistro's nom de plume. We're naming it after our own per-















   sonal  favourite  delicacy:  the  Roadkill  Cafe. But I'm
   being rude. Mr. ...

26-PARIS:   Paris.  I'm  here  trying to find the girl of my
   dreams, Miss Oktoberfest.


27-LORENZO:  The pageant in question is  just  over  yonder.
   But,  pray  tell, you aren't planning to take your sheep,
   are you? 


28-PARIS:  Shouldn't I? 


29-LORENZO:  Why, think of the undesirable jealousy that you
   would arouse by arriving with such winsome livestock. The
   last time Darius took his skunk  Binky  to  the  theatre,
   people  all  over  were  screaming and yelling with envy.
   (Lorenzo HAS A QUICK, SILENT CONFERENCE WITH  Darius  AND
   Darius) Darius here suggests that you find someone versed
   in critter husbandry to look after them. 


30-PARIS:  You fellows look like responsible... you seem  to
   know what you're... do you know anything about sheep?


31-LORENZO:   Don't  worry,  Paris.  We'll  be gentle. (THEY
   COLLECT THE SHEEP AND EXIT)

   Boy, you are to me   
   That slimy trail that a slug would leave 
   And I know you'll smell this way for always. 


   PARIS:   
   But I still know 
   That our love could grow 
   And forever it will be us and the sheep.

        Well, at least he'll treat me better than the

   And a flock to call our own for always.

   But he'll help me get away from these Greeks 



   So I'll play along with him -- for now, anyways.
