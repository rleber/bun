Morgana, Guinevere, AND Serfette MUST  BE  FEMALE,  BUT  THE
OTHERS COULD BE CAST ON THE BASIS OF WHO'S AVAILABLE - THEIR
NAMES CAN BE CHANGED)   


[L-1] (LIGHTS UP)                                            L  


(AN OUTDOOR CLASSROOM AT DAWN.  IN LIEU OF CHAIRS AND  DESKS
FOR   THE  STUDENTS  ARE  ASSORTED  LARGE  ROCKS.   Merlin's
BLACKBOARD IS SOME SORT OF FLAT VERTICAL SURFACE, THE BORDER
OF  WHICH  RESEMBLES  A  COUPLE OF STONEHENGE SUPPORTS AND A
CROSSPIECE.  Merlin HAS SOME SORT OF WORKBENCH.  PERHAPS  IN
THE  BACKGROUND  WE  SEE  A  BACKDROP, OR FLATS, OR SOME SET
PIECES, WHICH BRING TO MIND THE STANDARD  MEDIEVAL  LACK  OF
PERSPECTIVE IN A HUMOROUS WAY)  


(Norman AND Fedabeer WANDER ON STAGE, A LITTLE EARLY FOR THE
CLASS)  



















111-SSSIIIRRR FFFEEEDDDAAABBBEEEEEERRR:  Norman, how's it going?   You  taking  this
   class too?

   fit in that sounded any  good.   I'm  worried  about  the
   prof, though.  I've heard he's a little flaky.   


3-FEDABEER:  Ah, don't sweat it.  Say, the dons at Hamlet II
   have organized an orientation melee later this evening  -
   why don't you help me warm up a bit?

4-NORMAN:  Sure.


(THE  TWO  OF  THEM  START  A  FRIENDLY  SWORD  FIGHT.  WHEN
Fedabeer DRAWS FROM HIS SCABBARD, WE SEE THAT HIS WEAPON IS,
IN  FACT,  A  RIDGID TOOL.  EACH TIME EITHER OF THEM SWINGS,
THEY FIRST ROLL A PAIR OF CAR 'FUZZY DICE' WHICH ONE OF THEM
BROUGHT,  AND  CHECK  IT, ADJUSTING THE SUCCESS OF THE SWING
ACCORDINGLY.  THIS GOES ON BRIEFLY, JUST LONG ENOUGH FOR THE
POINT  TO  SINK  IN.   Guinevere's  ENTRANCE  INTERRUPTS THE
FIGHT)  








5-FEDABEER:  Guinevere, why so down?


666-GGGUUUIIINNNEEEVVVEEERRREEE TTTOOOTTTHHHEEELLLEEEFFFTTT:  It's Arthur.  We've broken up.  


7-FEDABEER:  Sorry to hear that.  What's the problem?   


8-GUINEVERE:  It's our sex life.  Every time I want to  play
   doctor,  he  pulls  out all these potions and leeches.  I
   think his master's thesis is getting  to  him.   And  the
   worst  of  it  is,  he's  going  to  be the T.A. for this
   course!  


(THE OTHER STUDENTS WANDER ON FROM VARIOUS DIRECTIONS)  


999-SSSIIIRRR LLLAAANNNCCCEEELLLOOOTTT BBBUUUSSSTTTEEERRR:  (POSSESSIVELY)  So, Guin, who's your
   friend?  


10-GUINEVERE:   Just  that  -- a friend.  Fedabeer is one of
   the Royal Engineers.  This is Lancelot.  


(THEY GREET CIVILLY.  THE SCAVENGER TEAM, WHICH CONSISTS  OF
Lancelot,  Hadagal,  Kay,  Fedabeer, Cumference, AND Norman,
HAVE GATHERED ABOUT Guinevere)  


111111-SSSIIIRRR HHHAAADDDAAAGGGAAALLL:  Hey guys, did you pick up the list for  the
   scavenger quest from the Magicsoc office?














12-GUINEVERE:   Oh,  yes, I almost forgot about it!  Here it
   is.  (READING)  The winning team will be that which earns
   the  most points by collecting objects from the following
   list.  Let's see, the most  Holy  Grail,  the  sword  Ex-
   calibur, ten dragon's teeth, a shrubbery...  


13-HADAGAL:  No problem!  My great-aunt is a shrubber!  


111444-SSSIIIRRR CCCUUUMMMFFFEEERRREEENNNCCCEEE OOOFFF TTTHHHEEE RRROOOUUUNNNDDD TTTAAABBBLLLEEE:   And  my  dad  has  a

   barn as a theatre!   


(THEY ALL GIVE Kay A WITHERING LOOK)

16-GUINEVERE:  Sure, Kay.  Now, I want you guys to keep this
   in mind:  (INDICATING THE LIST) the Grail  and  Excalibur
   are both worth more than all the others put together.  So
   keep your eyes open. 


17-KAY:  What can I look for, guys!?



18-LANCELOT:  Well, Sir Ahh!


19-KAY:  That's Sir Kay.


20-LANCELOT:  Sir Kay, Sir Ahh, Sir Ahh  --  whatever.   Why
   don't  you  look  for a bag-of-holding for our stuff, and
   stay out of trouble? 


21-KAY:  How come you guys never let me do anything?


22-LANCELOT:  Because you're 'special', Kay.


(Arthur ENTERS.  Arthur AND Guinevere EXCHANGE  LOOKS  WHICH
CLEARLY  INDICATE  THAT THEY ARE DYING TO GET BACK TOGETHER,
BUT ARE TOO PROUD.  Arthur NOTICES Merlin's APPROACH)

   By my lady's honour, look at that dragon!


(EVERYONE LOOKS AWAY.  Merlin HURRIES ON)   


   Poof!!!! 


(JUST AS EVERYONE LOOKS BACK, Merlin HAS STRUCK A POSE AS IF
HE HAS JUST MATERIALIZED)   


(IT MIGHT BE CONVENIENT TO HAVE A COUPLE OF  SERFS  BRINGING
STUFF  TO  AND FROM Merlin DURING THE COURSE OF HIS LECTURE,
SO AS TO AVOID CLUTTER.  IF THIS IS DONE, MAY I  SUGGEST  AN
OLDER,  BEARDED  SERF,  AND  A YOUNG GIRL SERF, NAMELY, Papa
Serf AND Serfette)  



















222444-MMMEEERRRLLLIIINNN TTTRRRAAAVVVEEELLL:  Good morning, lords and ladies,  my  name
   is  Professor  Merlin.   Today's introductory lecture for
   Swords and Sorcery 101 will be an overview of the  topics
   we will be covering this term.   


(Merlin PAUSES TO TAKE A DRINK FROM HIS CUP )   


[L-2]  (WHEN HE PICKS IT UP, THE CUP IS BATHED IN A WONDROUS L  
LIGHT)  


[S-1] (CHOIR OF ANGELS)                                      S  


(AFTER A SIP, Merlin DOUBLE-TAKES THE CUP)  


   Whoa, that mead has some kick!  Now, before we  get  onto
   the  material itself, I would like to ask Brother Love if

   he  would  be  so kind as to step forward and deliver the
   invocation.  


(Brother Love COMES FORWARD, AND APPEARS TO BE ABOUT TO SING
A  VERY  SERIOUS LATIN MASS, BUT SWITCHES INTO LOUNGE LIZARD
MODE)   


222555-BBBRRROOOTTTHHHEEERRR LLLEEEEEE LLLOOOVVVEEE:  (TO THE TUNE OF 'CAN'T HELP FALLING IN







   LOVE') Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison.  Thank you, you've
   been great.  Vos amo - and I mean that sincerely!


26-MERLIN:  Thank you, Brother Love.  One of the most useful
   of  the black arts is divination - to see that which can-
   not be seen.  If I could just have a  little  silence,  I
   will reach into the Briefcase of Omniscience, and provide
   you with an example. 


(HE GESTURES APPROPRIATELY) 


27-MERLIN:  (PULLING OUT SOME NUMBERS AND ARRANGING THEM  ON
   THE  'BOARD'  AS  HE SPEAKS) I sense a time when English-
   speaking peoples will suffer greatly under French domina-
   tion.    (HE  HAS  ARRANGED  '1066'  ON  THE  BOARD.   HE
   CONSIDERS IT BRIEFLY) Wait, let's not  be  too  Hastings.
   (AS HE TURNS THE 6'S UPSIDE-DOWN AND RE-ARRANGES) It is a
   time much further into the future than that.   (IT  READS
   '1990')  I see a monster -- by name, The Bear Bourassa --
   a fearsome beast with nasty, pointy teeth,  and  notwith-
   standing claws!  


222888-HHHEEERRRAAALLLDDDIIICCC RRRIIIVVVEEERRRAAA:  That's incredible!  How can he possibly
   know these things?   













222999-MMMOOORRRTTT DDD'AAARRRTTTHHHUUURRR:  Incredible?  Hah!   He's  not  predicting
   anything,   he's  remembering!   Merlin  lives  backwards
   through time, so he's already seen the future.   


30-MERLIN:  You little knave!  You think  it's  easy  always
   knowing  what's  in  store?   Never  being  able to enjoy
   Agatha Christie!  Or a day at the race track!  I mean,  I
   already  have  a  headache  from the awful notes the min-
   strels will be playing during the  following  spontaneous
   musical number!  


31-HERALDIC:  Ah -- pre-minstrel syndrome.  


[M-1]  (THE  BAND  PLAYS  THE INTRO TO THE SONG, AND FLUBS A M  
NOTE)   


(Merlin DOES A TAKE TO THE AUDIENCE AS IF TO SAY 'SEE?'.  HE
SINGS:)

   It's a crime, my time is flowing backwards   
   Do not envy me   
   Mine's the strangest love life you will ever see.


   And, for me, there's no such thing as foreplay   
   It's a dreadful curse
   I enjoy my carnal pleasures in reverse.  


   Women scoff when they see that you're,   
                somewhat premature in bed   
   When I answer their call so deep,
                first I fall asleep instead.


   Then I wake, aglow, the morning after
   Lovestruck to the core   
   Wishing to remember it forevermore   
   (But) I can't recall the magic of the night before.  


(Merlin TAKES ANOTHER DRINK FROM HIS CUP TO RECOVER FROM HIS
GRIEF.  HE IS SUDDENLY UPLIFTED)

32-MERLIN:   The  second half of this course will be a study
   of  Alchemical  Engineering.   Of  course,  one  of   the
   greatest  achievements in this field is the transmutation





   of lead into gold.  (HE BEGINS TO PERFORM THE EXPERIMENT)
   Just  mix  a few powders, add a tincture of Philosopher's
   Stone,  and...  (HE  CONTINUES  THE  EXPERIMENT  WITH  NO
   HESITATION  DURING  THE  NEXT  LINE) oh dear... you might
   wish to cover your eyes -- I'm afraid I'm about to make a
   dreadful mistake.  (HE MAKES A MISTAKE)

33-MERLIN:  Hmmm, a little too much eye of newt, I think.   


(THE FOLLOWING EXCHANGE OCCURS WHILE Merlin, Arthur, AND THE
Serfs CLEAN UP) 


34-NORMAN:  This is crazy!  There's a  much  easier  way  of
   turning lead into gold!

35-KAY:  What's that?   


36-NORMAN:  You just take your lead ingot down to the golds-
   mith's, hit him over the head with it, and take  all  the
   gold you want!   


37-MERLIN:   I  would  now  like to introduce the fellow who
   will be assisting you with your labs, my  Talismanic  Ap-



   prentice, Art.   


38-ARTHUR:   Thank you, professor.  Tomorrow at dawn, as the
   course's first lab, we shall be witness to a very special
   contest,  held between our own Dr. Merlin, and one of the
   University's most distinguished scholars, Dr. Morgana.   


39-HERALDIC:  Will this  be  a  traditional  tournament,  in
   which they try to knock each other out of the saddle with
   tilting spears?  


40-ARTHUR:  Surely you joust.  Since  the  outcome  of  this
   contest  will  determine  the  new Dean of the Faculty of
   Magic, the candidates will be drawing upon  their  finest
   skills in the Black Arts.


41-MORT:   Do you mean to tell me that the rewards of higher
   office  are  not  given  to  those  working  in   serious
   research,  but  to  whoever  can  dazzle us with a lot of
   flashy pyrotechnics? 


42-ARTHUR:  You forget, Merlin has seen the 20th century.   


43-MORT:  I think it stinks!


44-ARTHUR:  Look here, peasant!  What's your name?  


45-MORT:  Mort D'Arthur, 'sir'. 


46-ARTHUR:  Mort, you'll be the death of me.  (TO  THE  REST
   OF THE CLASS)  So, that's all.  See you at dawn.
