Act 3, Scene 5 - Bus Stop   


(HUARYU AND LEFTY STAND AT THE BUS STOP PLAYING 
"PAPER, STONE, SCISSORS". KAMIKAZE KLINGON STANDS TO ONE SIDE)  
(FIRST DRAW: HUARYU HAS PAPER, LEFTY HAS SCISSORS)  


.hu 
Scissors cut paper. 


(SECOND DRAW: HUARYU HAS STONE, LEFTY HAS PAPER)


Paper wraps up stone.   


THIRD DRAW: HUARYU HAS SCISSORS, LEFTY HAS STONE)   


.le 
(GESTURES A STONE, SCISSORS, THEN SMASHES FIST ON THE   
GROUND) 


(LEFTY MARKS A CROSS ON HUARYU'S SHOULDER AND IS ABOUT TO   
PUNCH HER WHEN WE HEAR A CAR APPROACH. LEFTY THUMBS IT, 
BUT IT DOES NOT STOP)   
.hu 
I'm beginning to get desperate, Lefty. You're sure  
that this bus will take us somewhere that they have a page? 


(LEFTY NODS "YES")  


Are you sure someone didn't just put a bus stop sign
here to fool people?


(LEFTY NODS "YES")  


Are you sure the bus system hasn't gone out of business?


(LEFTY SCRATCHES HIS HAND. HE WAVES HIS HAND INDECISIVELY)  



(THE 8 ENGINEERS IN DRAG ENTER) 


.aa ENG1
There's something funny about the way you   
dress that I can't quite put my finger on.  


.hu 
What - who are you? 


.aa ENG2
We're the Ignschlock Rape Patrol.   




(LEFTY SUDDENLY LEAPS IN FRONT OF HUARYU TO PROTECT HER)


.aa ENG3
Oh, don't worry, Lefty. We're not like that anymore.


.hu 
You know them, Lefty?   


(LEFTY NODS "YES!") 


.aa ENG4
Sure, he was a igneer once. He enrolled in civil igneering, but 
dropped out 4 months later. 


.hu 
What happened?  


.aa ENG4
Well, after 4 months of classes with guys like us, he realized  
that there's no such thing as a civil igineer. So   
he quit.


.hu 
(SUSPICIOUS) Why was he trying to protect me from you?  


.aa ENG5
Oh, that.   


(LEFTY NODS "YES, THAT!")   


You see, we first joined the rape patrol because it 
seemed like an excellent way to get in some raping in our   
spare time. 


.aa ENG6
Then they explained to us that the actual purpose of the patrol 
was to  
.ul 
prevent 
rapes.  


.aa ENG5
And, being the gentlemen that we are-   


(LEFTY GIVES A BULLSHIT SIGN)   


-we decided to stay with the patrol.


.hu 
I see. And you wear dresses so that rapists will think that 
you're potential victims and try to attack you? 


.aa ENG7
No, we just like to wear dresses. Bye now!  


(THEY FILE OUT. HUARYU AND LEFTY WAVE. LEFTY GIVES THE FINGER)  


.hu 
Boy, I wish you could talk. It's such a bother carrying 
on a conversation with a dumb person _ oops, no offense.


(LEFTY DRUMS HIS FINGERS ON THE GROUND) 


Wait, I've got an idea. 


(PAINTS MOUTH ON HIS HAND)  


There, I'm not a communications officer for nothing.
(PAUSE) Well, say something.


(LEFTY MOTIONS HER TO COME CLOSER. HE THEN WHISPERS SOMETHING IN HER EAR,   
WHEREUPON SHE SLAPS HIM)


.le 
It was only an idea.
Look, I'm sorry.  What more can I say?  


(HUARU SILENT, HUFFY.)  


It's just that, well, I've never known a starship   
communications officer quite as nice as you.
You are nice, you know that?


(SHE SOFTENS A BIT, BUT REMAINS SILENT.)


It's awfully lonely being an arm, especially with    thamy b

my brother so far away. In fact, I'd almost give my hand to make
you see my way. 


.hu 
Oh, all right, I forgive you.   


(LEFTY SHAKES)  


Say Lefty, this is your territory.  How often do the buses  
run?


.le 
Twice.  


.hu 
Twice what?  Twice an hour? 


(LEFTY SHAKES NO)   


Twice a half-hour?  


(LEFTY SHAKES NO AGAIN.)


Twice a .....?  


.le 
Just twice.  (GESTURES) Once going, and once coming back.   


.hu 
Oh, no.  Your Munchkin transit reminds me of Beerwurst  
Coach Lines except that 
.ul 
they
don't always come back. 


.le 
Really?  Beerwurst always comes back on me. 


.hu 
(MAKES FACE.  PAUSE.)  Say -- where's that ticking  
noise coming from?  


(HUARU AND LEFTY  LOOK AROUND AND FINALLY NOTICE
THE KAMAKAZE KLINGON.   
IN HIS HAND IS A ROCK.  
THE KAMIKAZE KLINGON TICKS THROUGHOUT THE SCENE.)   


.le 
Over here!  Look at this.  What could it be?


.hu 
Oh no!  The scarf!  The sword!  
It can't be, but it is!   It's Franz, the Kamikaze  
Klingon, and look, he's got a rock. 


.le 
What's the matter, do you want one too? 


.hu 
You don't understand, he's probably set to go   
off any second now!  We must do something.  


.le 
Let me handle this.  I think I've got a fair grasp  
of the situation. (TO KK)...


.hu 
Why are you here?   
Just standing there ticking won't do you any good.  
(THICK GERMAN ACCENT.)  Ve  
haff vays of making you tock.   


.hu 
You won't get any information out of him.  Our only 
hope is to get out of here as quickly as possible.  


.le 
And miss the bus?  Never.  Besides I've an idea.
Move slowly away from him.  (THEY DO)  Now  
turn your face away, don't look at him.  Just pretend   
he doesn't exist.   


(TICKING FADES, THEN DIES.) 


.hu 
Lefty, it worked.  How did you know?  Did you apply 
your four months of training as an igneer?  


.le 
Don't be silly!  All that taught me to do was build 
bridges.  No I simply employed an old aphorism that 
I learned in my younger days.   


.hu 
What was that?  


.le 
"No watchee, no tickee."


.hu 
Oh, Lefty, you're so handy. 


.le 
A lot handier than you think.
