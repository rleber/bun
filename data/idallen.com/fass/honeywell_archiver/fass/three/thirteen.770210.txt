(HUARYU AND LEFTY HIT DECK AS BUS SOUNDS    
ARE HEARD--BUS COMES AND GOES)  


.hu 
What was that that just missed us?  


.le 
The bus.


.hu 
Oh, no.  When's the next one?   


.le 
(WHO HAS BEEN PATTING HIMSELF ON THE GROUND AND NOW STOPS)  
Three  hours.  (RESUMES PATTING)


.hu 


What are you doing? 


.le 
Just checking my pockets to see if I
have the exact change.  


.hu 
But you don't have any pockets. 


.le 
No wonder I don't have the change.  


.hu 
I don't have any either.


.le 
Pockets?


.hu 
No, change.  How are we going to pay the
exact fare without any change?  


.le 
Here comes someone.  Why don't we ask her?  


(ENTER CHICK FROM LEFT BACKSTAGE, PREFERABLY SLEAZY,
WEARING LARGE WRIST WATCH ON LEFT ARM.) 


.aa CHICK   
(TO LEFTY)  
Hi handsome, got the time?  


(LEFTY GRABS HER ARM, "LOOKS" AT THE WATCH) 



.le 
Nine fifteen.  Got change for a credit? 


.aa CHICK   
Cheapskate!  (STOMPS OFF)   


.hu 
Now what do we do?  


.le 
Well, there's a store of some kind over 
there.  


(POINTS TO FRONT OF STAGE AS LIGHTS 
COME UP ON THAT AREA.  JJ IS SITTING AT DESK OR 
TABLE, HEAD BOWED, EYES CLOSED.  THERE IS A LARGE   
PLASTIC BAG OF GREEN ORGANIC MATTER ON TABLE.   
ALSO A BELL, PILE OF RECORDS, AND BOX WITH  
LID.  LEFTY AND HUARYU PROCEED DOWNSTAGE
TO JJ)  


.hu 
Excuse me.  


(JJ SNORES SOFTLY, HUARYU RAISES
VOICE)  


Uh ...Excuse me.


(JJ SNORES LOUDER. HUARYU SHOUTS)   


Excuse me!! 


(JJ SNORES A REAL KILLER)   


(TO LEFTY)  
Now what do we do?  


.le 
(THOUGHTFULLY)  That rings a bell...


.hu 
It's worth a try.   
(GRABS BELL AND RINGS)  


.aa JJ  
(OPENS EYES SUDDENLY, JUMPS UP, LIFTS   
LID, SHOUTS IN)  Be down in a minute!   
(TO HUARYU AND LEFTY)   
I'm sorry but we're closed. 


.hu     
(PERPLEXED)  Closed?


.aa JJ  
Yes, it's Monday.  We're never open on  
Monday, a Monday, a Monday...   


.le 
But it's not Monday.


.aa JJ  
It's not?   


.le 
No.  It won 't be Monday until a week from today.   


.aa JJ  
Oh!  In that case we must be open; I should 
take down the closed sign.  


.hu 
There isn't one.


.aa JJ  
Oh?  (PEERS TOWARDS DOOR)  Oh, the cat must've eaten it...  
Well, what can I do for you?


.hu 
Can you change a credit?


.aa JJ  
Into what?  


.hu 
Nickels, dimes, quarters... 


.aa JJ  
Good heavens, no.  You'll want the bank down
the road.  Just take the number 9 bus   
south until you reach-  


.hu 
But you don't understand!   
We haven't got the exact change.  That's why    
we came in here.


.aa JJ  
Oh, I see.  You just want some change.  


.hu 
That's right.   


.aa JJ  
(HANDING HER CLOTHES)  Here.


.hu 
What's that?


.aa JJ  
A change.   


.hu 
All this just for one credit!   


.aa JJ  
Today we're having a special:  all this for 
half a credit.  


.hu 
Look, all I want is some coins to give the  
bus driver. 


.aa JJ  
Well, perhaps you'd like to purchase something? 


.hu 
(LOOKING INTO PLASTIC BAG)  What's this?


.aa JJ  
(GRABS BAG AND STUFFS AWAY)  That's not for sale.   


.hu 
What is it? 


.aa JJ  
Food for my gerbil. 


.le 
You have a gerbil?  


.aa JJ  
No.  (PAUSE)  Not any more. 


.hu 
Did the cat eat it? 


.aa JJ  
No, the mailman trampled him.  Poor Robert. 


.hu 
I'm very sorry.  How did it happen? 


.aa JJ  
He was running from the dog. The mailman, that is.  


.le 
The dog was chasing him?


.aa JJ  
No, the dog was being chased by the Bengal  
tiger, which was running away from a flock of   
fruitbats.  


.le 
And who was chasing the fruitbats?  


.aa JJ  
The fire in the basement.   
(PAUSE)  Chased them right up the stairs
and out of the house.  Made a frightful mess
of the lawn.  Burnt places all over.  All it's  
good for now is waterpolo.  


.hu 
(CHANGING THE SUBJECT)  Is there anything for sale here?


.aa JJ  
Oh, yes.  All kinds of things.  (PAUSE)  Actually, you see, we  
only sell one thing here.   


.hu 
What's that?


.aa JJ  
(LOOKING AROUND)  Where?


.hu 
No, no, no.  What do you sell?  


.aa JJ  
Oh!  We sell ring modulators.   


.aa HUARYU~AND~LEFTY
(STUNNED)  What?!   


.aa JJ  
We sell ring modulators.  This is Thee  
Ring Modulator Shop.


.le 
(STILL INCREDULOUS)  The ring modulator 
shop?   


.aa JJ  
No, 
.ul 
Thee
Ring modulator shop.


.le 
That's what 
.ul 
we  
said.   


.hu 
And that's exactly what we want... a ring   
modulator, I mean.  


.aa JJ  
(POUTING)   
I thought you wanted change.


.hu 
Yes, well, we wanted change for the bus, but-   


.aa JJ  
You can't buy a bus with just change.   


.hu 
No, you don't understand.  We wanted to 
take the bus to find the true page to take to   
the winkle to get a ring modulator. 


.aa JJ  
Well, you'd better hurry.  It looks like
you've got a big day ahead of you!  


.le 
We decided to get the ring modulator
first.  


.aa JJ  
Well, you've certainly come to the right place  
for that! You say you want a ring modulator?


.le 
If my memory serves me correctly.   


.aa JJ  
Well that's what we sell here. What kind were you thinking of?  


.hu 
Do you have a number 14?


.aa JJ  
I'm not sure. (POINTS TO A STACK OF RECORDS) Have a look.   
They're in alphabetical order.  


.hu 
(SEARCHING THROUGH STACK) I don't think there's one here.   


.aa JJ  
(GLANCES AT BOOK) No, there isn't.  


.le 
Does this mean you don't have a number 14?  


.aa JJ  
Not necessarily. I might be sitting on one. (LOOKS) 
Yes, here we are! (HOLDS UP MANGLED DISC) That'll be
40 quid.


.le 
What?   


.aa JJ  
That'll be 40 quid. 


.hu 
(INTO COMMUNICATOR) Mr. Jock! I need 40 quid.   


.jo 
Heeeeey! Que pasa?  


.hu 
I need 40 squids to buy a ring modulator.   


.jo 
Far out, man!   


.hu 
(EXASPERATED) I need -  


.aa JJ  
No, no, no! Forty   
.ul 
quid.   


.hu 
What?   


>aa JJ  
40 quid... 40 pounds.   


.hu 
40 pounds of squid? 


.aa JJ  
No, no! You don't understand! 40 pounds sterling.   


.hu 
Change that, Mr. Jock. He wants 40 pounds of starlings. 


.jo 
Oh, wow, like starlings, man!   


.st 
(SOBER) I believe that the gentleman is asking for 40   
pounds sterling.


.hu 
That's what I said. 


.st 
No, you don't understand.   


.hu 
So I've been told.  


.st 
You see, pounds sterling is a type of currency. 
(ASIDE) Get off my leg, Jock.   


.hu 
Oh. (TO JJ) How much is that in Pederasty units?


.aa JJ  
Couple o' bucks.


.hu 
Damn. I only have one credit.   


.aa JJ  
We take Master Charge.  


.hu 
No, that's no good. I don't have a card, just a credit. 
(PAUSE. TO COMMUNICATOR) Mr. Spot, would you beam us down a 
couple of credits? And tell me, is Mr. Jock all right?  


.st 
He's doing fine.


.jo 
Wow, yeah. (STONED LAUGH)   


.st 
Shuttup, Jock!  


.hu 
(PULLS BILLS AND GIVES TO JJ)   


There. Keep the change. 
(TO LEFTY) Let's get back to the Winkle. (COMMUNICATOR) Mr. Spot.   
We have a ring modulator. Please notify the others to meet usa at the   
Winkle's palace.

.aa JJ  
Wait! Would you like a page before you go?

No thanks, I can't afford one.

That's all right; I'm a free page.

Oh. Come along, then. I'll leaf through you on the way.
