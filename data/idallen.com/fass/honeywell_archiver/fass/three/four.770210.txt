Act 3, Scene 4 - Tom Brzustowskabil 


(TOM BRZUSTOWSKABIL IS SITTING ALONE AT A DESK CENTER STAGE.  THE DESK  
IS PILED HIGH ON BOTH SIDES WITH STACKS OF PAPER.  THERE IS A LOWER 
STACK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESK WHERE HE WORKS.  DRAPED OVER
THE DESK IS SOME RED RIBBON (AS IN RED TAPE). THE DOG-EARED PAGE ENTERS.
SHE HAS THE RED RIBBON WOUND AROUND HER A FEW TIMES WITH A TRAIL OF 
RIBBON DRAGGING BEHIND. THE TRAIL LEADS ALL THE WAY OFF STAGE)  


.aa PAGE
I have an important document for you, sir.  


.tb 
(NOTICES THAT THE DOCUMENT IS NOT VERY LONG)
Read it for me please.  


.aa PAGE
Sorry, but it says right here (POINT AT THE TOP OF THE DOCUMENT), here  
(POINTING TO THE MIDDLE OF THE DOCUMENT) and here (NEAR THE END OF  
THE DOCUMENT) that it is for your eyes only.


.tb 
Very well. Give it here.


(THE PAGE DOES SO BUT CONTINUES TO STAND BY TOM BRZUSTOWSKABIL'S DESK.  
TOM DOES NOT LIKE THIS) 


Yes.


.aa PAGE
Yes?


.tb 
Are you waiting for something?  


.aa PAGE
No. Are you?


.tb 
Of course not! Why are you standing there?  


.aa PAGE
Where should I be standing? 


.tb 
Shouldn't you be doing something?   


.aa PAGE
Like what?  


.tb 
Why don't you think of something?   


.aa PAGE
Have you any ideas? 


.tb 
Why do you always answer my questions with a question?  


.aa PAGE
Do I?   


.tb 
Will you stand over there before I tear your arm off and beat you with  
the wet end?


.aa PAGE
(PAUSE) Sure.   


(TOM INDICATES AN OUT OF THE WAY CORNER. THE PAGE COMPLIES AND  
TOM CLEARS HIS THROAT AND BEGINS TO READ)   


.tb 
The show so far.
The crew of the Satirize has landed on Fed, 
where they are presently looking for the true page. Spotty, 
Jock and Officer Knightly are in rough shape.   
A page brings Tom Brzustowskabil a document to read.  As he does
so Ensign Tolstoy comes in.  They exchange some casual banter.  


(AT THIS POINT TOLSTOY ENTERS FOLLOWING THE RED RIBBON. 
TOM LOOKS UP AT THE NOISE HE IS MAKING, 
THEN STANDS UP AND OFFERS HIS HAND WHICH TOLSTOY SHAKES)



.to 
Hello. I'm Ensign Tolstoy of the starship Satirize, its five-year-  


.tb 
I've read all that Ensign. (PATS DOCUMENT)  
I'm Tom Brzustowskabil of the mountain of red tape - V.P.   


.to 
Yes, I've been following the tape.  What's the V.P. stand for?  


.tb 
Vox populi. 


.to 
Oh, the sailor man! 


.tb 
(LOOKS EXASPERATED) 
You misunderstand. You know, you talk sort of funny.  I think   
you should take the Munchkinese Proficiency Test.   


(TOM RUSHES TOLSTOY AROUND HIS DESK AND SITS HIM IN THE CHAIR,  
PLACING A PIECE OF PAPER IN FRONT OF HIM. TOLSTOY PROTESTS  
FEEBLY) 


Now all you have to do is write a paragraph describing the conflict 
between quality and quantity of energy. 


.to 
(TALKING WHILE WRITING) 
Well, let's see:
.nf 
.in+5   
The quantity of energy is not sustained,
It droppeth as the gentle silicon from heaven   
Upon the place beneath-

.fi 
.tb 
That's enough.  You flunk.  


.to 
But why......

     Your spelling is bad;  
     Your grammar is worse. 
.to 
     How can you tell   
     From reading one verse?
.tb 
     The prose is wordy,
.to 
     Pur-ty,
.tb 
     Excruciating,  
.to 
     Fascinating.   
     I can't adore it more! 
.tb 
     I just abhor it, for   
     It's too verbose.  
.to 
     No, it's terse.


     I think your taste smells. 
.tb 
     I think yours does, too.   
.to 
     A monkey that spells   
     Has more class than you.   
.tb 
     I don't think you will 
     Make - it - here - at -
     U. of Munchkinloo. 
.to 
     You're a sweetie pie, too! 


.tb 
(SPOKEN) You dance well.


.to 
(SPOKEN) Thank you, so do you.  


     Some men can   
     Do a Highland fling, even as they sing.
     They can jump about, cut a caper.  
.tb 
     Wiggle as they do, even hootchy-coo,   
     Seem as if they're walking on air. 
.to 
     Jump up, turn around, get the rhythm down, 
     Let the music flow through your booties.   
.aa BOTH
     Our English tastes differ, but what do we care 
.tb 
     When we can
     Dance, take a stance, given half a chance  

     To perform with all of our prowess.
.to 
     Tap our toes a bit, then our English lit   
     Doesn't really need to impress.
.aa BOTH
     Friend, comrade or droogie,
     A man who can boogie   
     's A man who's sure of suc-
.tb 
     Free yourself from all distress.   
.aa BOTH
     Yes, we're sure of suc-
.to 
     Glad we straightened up this mess. 
.aa BOTH
     Yes, we're sure of suc-
     One more time now with finesse.
     Yes, we're sure of success!


(TOLSTOY AND TOM RETURN ARM IN ARM TO THE DESK) 


.to 
Really, though, that's not a fair test. 


.tb 
What do you mean?   


.to 
It doesn't relate to my cultural heritage.  


.tb 
What do you want us to do, give you the test in Russian?


.to 
Russian - smussian! I'm from the wilds of the North Campus. 


.tb 
Oh, my God. 


.aa VOICE   
Yes?


.tb 
Nothing, Burt - just a slip of the tongue.  


.aa VOICE   
Well, watch it! This is long distance from Florida. 


.tb 
Yes, sir. (TO TOLSTOY) Now, as I was saying, you'll have to take remedial   
Munchkin until you get rid of that outrageous accent.   ce  



.to 
What accent?
.ul 
I   
don't have an accent,   
.ul 
you 
have an accent. 


.tb 
Shhhh!  
.ul 
He  
(GESTURES UPWARDS) may be listening.


.to 
Oh, sorry.  


.tb 
Now just give me your ID number and I'll see that you're
enrolled in Remedial Munchkin 101.  
That's 6:30 'till noon Tuesday and R-day. (ASIDE) R-day...  
I used to know what R was.  


.to 
But I don't have a number!  


.tb 
What do you mean?   


.to 
I'm not a student.  


.tb 
Oh, no, not another Student Council Presidential Candidate! 


.to 
No, sir - I'm looking for a page.   


.tb 
Oh. (PAUSE) Here's a page: a title page.


.to 
That's not quite what I had in mind.


.tb 
How about a coloured page?  


.to 
That isn't either - I don't want a coloured page.   


.tb 
What are you, some kind of bigot?   
Here's a blank page.


(TOLSTOY SHAKES HIS HEAD)   


Drawn another blank, eh? Would you care for an appendix?


.to 
No, I had mine out. What I want is a human-type page.   


.tb 
Oh, one of those kinky types, are you?  

ce  

.to 
Look, I don't want any of your paper! I want an 
honest-to-goodness true 
.ul 
page!   


.aa PAGE
(ENTERING) Yes, sir?


.aa TOM~AND~TOLSTOY 
What?   


.aa PAGE
You called for a page, sir? 


.to 
Now this is what I'm after. This has got to be him! 
May I take him with me? 


.tb 
Well, it's highly irregular.


.aa PAGE
I beg your pardon! I know when I need a laxative.   


.to 
Can't you cut through the red tape and just let him go with me? 


.tb 
Well, I suppose...  


(CUTS OFF SOME RED TAPE, CUTS IT AND SIGNS IT - RUBBER STAMPS IT
TWENTY TIMES)   


There - that should do it!  


.to 
Thank you wery much, sir.   


(TOLSTOY AND THE PAGE EXIT) 


.tb 
Oh, well. Back to work, I suppose. Now where was I? Oh, yes.
(READS) The Ensign departs with the page.   
Suddenly, the sound of dragging chains and menacing feetsteps   
is heard to approach Tom from behind-   


(APPROPRIATE SOUND) 


-and a giant sledgehammer is brought down upon...   
(QUICK PAUSE, THEN TOM ERASES PART OF THE PAGE AND SAYS THE FOLLOWING   
LINES AS HE WRITES THEM IN) 
Suddenly, I am set upon by 8 luscious beauties who proceed to ravish
me and- 


.aa VOICE   
Tom!


.tb 
(QUAKING)   
Yes, sir?   


.aa VOICE   
I told you before - no policy changes while i'm away!   


.tb 
Oh, but Burt-   


(HE IS DROWNED OUT AS 8 ENGINEERS IN DRAG ENTER SINGING 
AND PROCEED TO RAVISH TOM. HE CALLS FOR HELP, AND THUNDER IS HEARD)
