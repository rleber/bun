(ENTER BRASSIERE. THE OFFICE IS EMPTY)  


.rb 
All right, where is everyone? Boy, you leave them alone for a week and they all skip out    
on you. What a crew this is!
Maybe I should just lock the doors and publish the blasted thing myself.


(PHONE RINGS)   


People's Bilingual Daily Gazette, Brassiere speaking. What? Just
hold it a minute and let me get this down. Okay, spell that. Z-I-M-...  
Yeah, okay, I've got it. And what happened there? Nothing!? 
Well, what are you calling in about... oh, just the name change!
Well why in heaven's name couldn't they call it something   
easier like Smith? Smithgenstein?   
All right, we'll try to run some thing on it anyway.
Yeah, goodbye. All power to you, too. (HANGS UP)
Where is everyone? Matilda! Woundwort! You just can't get good help 
these days. 


.wo 
(ENTERING)  
Yesssss, masssster? 


.rb 
Ah yes, Woundwort. Where is everyone? I get back and the office 
is empty.   


.wo 
Just putting the finishing touches on this week's edition. It'sss   
a goodie.   


.rb 
Well, look, I can't stay here. There have been a few complications in this  
operation. I've got to get back to the palace now.  
The Winkle has sent the members of the Satirize crew out to find the
one true page. If they succeed, then all the dissent that we have   
been sowing for the past few months will have gone to waste, and
we'll be no closer to taking over this planet than we were before.  


.wo 
The massster is a massster of disssguisssesss.  
Why does he not take the place of the Winkle and imprison the   
Satirize people if and when they return to the palace?  


.rb 
Just what I was thinking, Woundwort.


.wo 
I had a hunch you would be. 


.rb 
Back to that old line again, eh? Poor taste, old boy.   


.wo 
Yesss, masster. 


.rb 
Well, I have to get there and take the Winkle's place before any of 
the party return. The Boobies are just outside the door, and I expect   
they should be waking up any time now. Hold 
them here while I get my disguise.  


.wo 
Yesss, masster. 


.rb 
And do something about that lisp.   


.wo 
Lissssp?


.rb 
Never mind. Just keep the Boobies here until I get back. Now that Brassiere has them in his 
grasp, he will not let them go. 


.wo 
Trust me, massster, I will make ssure that they do not essscape.


.rb 
Cross your heart?   


(WOUNDWORT DOES SO IN THE APPROPRIATE MANNER)   


Good, I'm off.  


.wo 
Yesss, masster. 


(BRASSIERE EXITS. WOUNDWORT GOES OFF STAGE AND DRAGS THE BOOBIES ON STAGE   
ONE AT A TIME, PROPPING THEM UP AGAINST TWO DESKS THAT ARE ON THE STAGE.
HE MUTTERS TO HIMSELF ALL THE TIME THAT HE DOES THIS, IN TYPICAL IGOR   
FASHION. WHEN THEY ARE BOTH ON STAGE, HE TRIES TO WAKE THEM UP WITH LITTLE  
PATS ON THE CHEEK. EITHER TYPE OF CHEEK - TAKE YOUR PICK. THEY START
TO COME TO.)


.pd 
Where are we? What's happening? 


.pz 
Ohhh, Brian turn off the lights and come back to ...


.pd 
Who is Brian?   


.wo 
I'm Woundwort.

So?

(SNIVELLING A LITTLE AT THIS REBUKE)
Welcome to the People's Bilingual Daily Gazette offices. You are our
guests. 


.pd 
Is this one of Jerk's little jokes? Maybe he had the doctor 
fill me full of some sort of joy-juice? 
I bet you're really Jerk, but I'm so full of
Dexelexedrine, you look different. Vast improvement.


.pz 
What are you talking about? Who are you talking to? 


.pd 
Jerk. He's doped us up so that he can take advantage of us. 


.pz 
How like a man. 


.pd 
Indeed. Well, it won't work, let me assure you. Boobies are 
noted for the utmost of restraint, even 
when they're in their cups. 


.pz 
Unless it's already worked. 


.pd 
Right, unless it has already ... oh boy. Pig. You didn't even let   
us have a part of it. Don't try to deny it. I can tell by that hump on  
your back that you 've got one on your mind as well.


.wo 
I do not underssstand what you are talking about ladiesss. Thiss isss   
the People's Bilingual Daily Gazette.   


.pd 
Which is?   


.wo 
A publisssher of pagesss.   


.pz 
Bilingual and daily no doubt.   


.wo 
Actually they only come out once a week, and entirely in low munchkin, or as you would call it, English.


.pd 
Then why do you call yourselves that?   



.wo 
We liked the name.  


.pz 
What do you want from us?  Why are we all tied up like this?  Say are   
you guys bondage.....nahh.  


.wo 
We want you for the same reason the Federation does.  We want your  
silicon.


.pd 
Now what on earth.....  


.wo 
Fed.  The name of the planet is Fed.


.pd 
What on Fed would you people want with silicon? 
The Pederasty needs it for their starships, but you... Pride,   
do you know of any Fed starships?   


.pz 
No Fed starships that I've heard of. Ped yes.   
Klingsons.  Romulans and their allies, the McLaughlin Planetarians. 
The Jeffersons.  No Fed starships.  


.pd 
There. You see? 


.wo 
We do not want the silicon for power.  We want it for injections.   


(PRIZE TURNS TO PRIDE.  THEY LOOK AT EACH OTHER, AND RAISE THEIR
EYEBROWS.)  


.pz 
Injections? 


.wo 
Yes, in the soles of our feet.  We want to be the same size as the  
other humanoids of the galaxy.  We want enough silicon to make  
every munchkin on Fed seven foot five.  


.pd 
Why seven foot five?


.wo 
It seemed like a nice round number. 

?   

.pz 
Have you tried elevator shoes?  


.wo 
Too obvious.


.pz 
I don't know what would be so subtle about feet that had a depth
of a yard and a half.   


.wo 
(WHISPERING)
I know that, but the others haven't thought of it yet.  
The moment they fill up their feet with silicon, I'll sort of feel  
that they've joined the club.   


.pd 
As it were. 


(ENTER MATILDA. ON THE RUN.)


.wm 
Get back, get back, oh you devils, auggh they're all over the   
floor.  


.wo 
Allow me massster.  


(WOUNDWORT RUNS ABOUT THE FLOOR STANPING ON INVISIBLE CREATURES 
WHILE MATILDA DCOES THE SAME.  THEY SCREAM FROM TIME TO TIME    
THINGS LIKE "TAKE THAT, " AND "GET THAT ONE BEFORE HE GETS  
UNDER THE CHAIR," AND "WHY DO THEY TORMENT ME?"  PRIZE AND PRIDE TRY TO 
SEE WHAT IT IS THAT THEY'RE ATTACKING, AND LOOK ABOUT THE FLOOR 
UNEASILY.)  




.pd 
What is it? 


.wo 
(WHISPERING WHILE MATILDA BOUNCES MERRILY ABOUT STAMPING)   


We're not quite sure.  She said once that they were black   
and about ten inches high, but that's as far as she would go.   
We help her when she sees them, to quiet her dow

We help her when she sees them, to quiet her down.  


.pz 
Who is that?


.wo 
Wahlsten Matilda, our assistant editor. 


.pd 
Bit of a psycho.


.wo 
You might say that. (SCREAMING IN BOTH THEIR EARS.) 
Got you, you little bandit.  AAAAIIIII! 


.wm 
That's the last of them. Hoooo.  That was close.  Well, we're safe  
until they regroup. (NOTICES BOOBIES)  Who are they?


.wo 
They're Boobies.


.wm 
What about them?


.wo 
No, they
.ul 
are 
Boobies.


.wm 
Oh.  Oh, those Boobies.  The silicon girls. 


.pd 
Hmmph.  


.wm 
So Brassiere is back?   


.wo 
Back and gone again. It seems that  
the people from the Satirize have landed on the planet and  
are looking for the true page. As a result he's off to the palace to
impersonate the Winkle and make sure that they never find out   
we have the true page.  


.wm 
If in fact we do.  No one knows what the true page looks like.  


.wo 
I thought you said that that was the true page back in the storeroom.   


.wm 
Well, he says he's the true page. But then, they all do, don't they?
Still, we figured that we'd better not have him wandering about 
among the people when we are so close to starting the Revolution.   


.pd 
Revolution? 


.wm 
Yes, revolution.  Where were these people in scene two?     


.wo 
Under the influence of a sssedative, massster.  


.wm 
Another opiate of the masses.  All right you two, I'll explain  
once more, just in case there's someone else who was out-   
(SIDEWAYS GLANCE AT AUDIENCE)   
-when this was explained the first time.  We have been formenting dissent   
around the land for some time, turning the munchkins against    
the Winkle, promising them that they can be tall once again if  
they follow our leader Robert Brasieree.


.pd 
Once again. You mean that they were tall once?  


.wm 
At one time the average height of a munchkin was six foot   
three and a half.   


.pz 
What happened?  


.wm 
A group of travelling players came by the planets to put on a   
show.  Starvie Harvie and company, featuring the incomparable   
ChiChi la Cheek.  They hit every city in the country and so 
aroused the populace that they fell to vice.  In time the   't tplayers left and the

players left and the people went back to the drab normal way of life.   
But it stunted their growth permanently. It's a 
good thing they didn't go blind as well.


.wo 
(DROOLING)  
I went to every show.   


.pd 
So it appears.  


.wm 
The few of us who were out peddling pages in the streets during 
the show were saved from this fate worse than death.


.pz 
Someone tell you to go peddle your pages?   


.wm 
I wouldn't say that it was worse than death.


.wm 
You wouldn't. Anyway, that's the reason that    
the munchkins want to have silicon and that's the reason that we
can stir them up against the Winkle in these troubled   
times.  




.pd 
Why?


.wm 
Because he's still tall.  He was busy performing his own
act while the players-  


.wo 
- and the people -  


.wm 
- were performing theirs.  For a while they looked up to him
because of his height - 


(WOUNDWORT LOOKS UP AT MATILDA) 


but it wasn't too hard for the paper to turn respect into jealousy. 


.pd 
And now the people are ready to revolt. 


.wm 
Yes, as soon as we tell them that the silicon is at hand we 
have nothing to worry about.  We will be able to lead them on the   
palace any time we feel like it.  Hmmmmm.....   


.wo 
Yesss, massster?


.wm 
You say that Brassiere has gone to the palace to take the   
place of the Winkle.


.wo 
Yesss, massster.


.wm 
That's interesting.  Suppose that the revolt came while Brassiere   
was still disguised as the Winklke.  His disguises are always   
so foolproof that the revolting munchkins could never tell  
that it wasn't the real Winkle.  Hmmmmmm.  Woundwort take the   
Boobies into the next room and get them ready to go to court.   


.wo 
How massster?   


.wm 
Oh, freshen up their ropes or something. Don't bother me with   
details. And hurry. I'll be back in a second.   


.wo 
Yesss, massster.


(EXIT MATILDA)  


(ENTER BRASSIERE)   


.rb 
You're not going to believe this, but I almost forgot the boobies.  
I'm off!


(EXEUNT BRASSIERE AND BOOBIES)  


.wo 
Yessssss, massssster.   


(ENTER MATILDA) 


.wm 
Where are the boobies?  


.wo 
You're not going to believe this, but-  


.wm 
In tnis show I'd believe anything. Get the true page, I feel a  
soliliquy coming on.
Now let me see. All I have to do
is lead the munchkins against   
the palace while Brassiere is still on the throne, and kill 
him fast before he can prove that he isn't  
the Winkle.  I'll be the leader of the revolution.  
I'll have the Boobies, I'll have the silicon, and the   
munchkins will have no one else to choose as leader except  
me.  Leader.  Emperor.  Dictator.  Yes.  It's perfect.  


.je 
(CRASHING THROUGH THE DOOR WITH NURSE CHAPPEDLIPS UNDER HIS 
ARMS)  Not so fast, Brassiere!  


.wm 
I'm not Brassiere. I'm Wahlsten  Matilda,   
his assistant and usurper-elect.


.je 
Well, whoever you are, I heard you say that you had the true page,  
and I'm here for it.


.wm 
You can't take him he's........wauggh! There's one by your foot.

MATILDA WRENCHES THE PHASER FROM JERK'S HAND AND LEVELS IT ON

Are you the true page?

Shifts his loyalties quickly.

Yes, it's so hard getting good help these... enough of this.
It's time for you to die, Jerk. 


.je 
(SLYLY) 
If I have to die, I suppose I have to.  But surely you  
wouldn't want me to go on an empty stomach.  I've been carrying this pizza  
around with me for hours now, just waiting for a good spot to eat it, and now...


.wm 
I don't care about your greedy stomach. Don't you realize that there
are people starving in Zim.....Zim.... oh, blast, what is that name?
Well, who cares.  Give ne that pizza. I could   
use something to eat now.   


.je 
Now, Nurse Chappedlips!!

Okay, Page, you're coming with me back to the palace pronto. I've   
got to tell the Winkle that the plot is almost boiling over.  You keep him  
busy 'till we're out of here, Nurse.

Face it, Matilda, you're licked.  Come on, Page.

JERK AND THE PAGE LEFT ON, RATHER THAN THE SIDE WHERE HE WENT   
OFF.)

Yesss, Massster.
(HE IS BEGINNING TO SOUND A LITTLE TIRED.)  


.wm 
Get the Boobies and notify everyone. We're storming 
the palace now.

No buts.  The time is now or never.
