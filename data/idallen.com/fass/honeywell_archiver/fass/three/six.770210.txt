(THE IDEA OF THE SCENE IS THAT IT IS RUN ENTIRELY LIKE THE GONG SHOW.)  


.aa EMCEE   
Welcome to the show tonight, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the   
King Kong show where you go ape over your favourite contestant. 
Remember last week when Morgo the Friendly Brickman sang
his way into your hearts with Gorilla My Dreams; and here's the host of your
show K. K. Kong......   


(ENTER KONG WITH CASSETTE RECORDER UNDER HIS ARM. HE TURNS ON THE   
RECORDED APPLAUSE)  


.aa KONG
Good evening, good evening, thank you all, oh they love me, what can I say...   
(HE TURNS OFF THE LAUGH TRACK ABRUPTLY).
And we have a great show tonight folks, let me tell you.  But first let's   
introduce our panel.


(MAN WALKS ON AND OFF WITH A PIECE OF PANELLING)


Isn't that great? And we didn't even have to beam it here.  
And stay tuned for next week, when we bring in the Board of 
Entertainment. (TURNS ON LAUGH TRACK, STOPS IT).
Great stuff, they love me.  

And for our first act, we have Marshall Arts who will break the silence with
his bare hands. 
Give him a hand, folks, let's here it for Marshall Arts. (FARTING SOUND)
Arts, folks, arts.  


(ENTER MARSHALL ARTS. HE TRIES TO CLAP HIS HANDS TWICE AND FAILS. ON
THE THIRD TRY HE IS GONGED JUST AS HIS HANDS MEET)  


Oh, too bad there, Marshall, you got the old gong.  
Well, I can't understand that, I loved you. 


.aa MARSHALL
I thought you said that was our secret. 


.aa KONG
Great little kidder there, isn't he, folks? (LAUGH TRACK)   
Just go offstage there, Marsh, you're   
a gas.  Cement booties for him, boys.   
And next we have the great Dave McClell and his pet head, who will  
amaze you all with his daring feats of somnambulance and acoustics. 


(DM PLAYS A SONG ON HIS HEAD. GONG WITH THE WIND)   


Oh too bad there, Dave old boy.  You tried this once before, I recall.  
Oh, you don't like that word?  Well, I won't petition you to stay any longer,   
Dave, signature a very busy man.
And now folks we've got a real treat for you, the Bay City Reefers will 
.ul 
not 
play tonight because their act went up in smoke. (LAUGH TRACK)  
Instead, we bring you, for the first time on any stage, live or 
otherwise, from L. A. to New York, from New York to L. A., The Persecution  
and Assasination of Student Journalism as Performed by the Inmates of the   
Asylum at Segram and University under the Domination of the Marquis de Shane.   
Take it away, Bozos.

Who was the lady I saw you with last night? 


.aa FED2
That was no lady, that was my typewriter.  Actually, it wasn't my typewriter,   
but I don't think that...   


.aa FED3
I say, you've got a typewriter in your hands.   


.aa FED4
I'm sorry, I can't hear you, I've got a typewriter in my hands. 


.aa FED2
Order, Order.   


.aa FED3
Ham on rye, hold the mustard.   


.aa FED1
Have you got a quorum?  


.aa FED2
Sorry, sold right out of quorum.  How about a by-law?   


.aa FED1
Are you kidding? I broke the last three that I got from you.


.aa FED3
Well, then, how about a pickle? 


.aa FED4
We're in pretty much of a pickle as it is.

Boy, that was a dilly.  And now for a song ...

Point of order, point of order.  How do you get down off a high horse?

You get recalled.   


.aa FED4
I thought you get down off a duck.  


.aa FED2
Duck!   


(A BOOK IS THROWN ACROSS THE STAGE. FED1 PICKS IT UP)   


.aa FED1
This is what we should be reading - Roberts Rules of Order. 


.aa FED2
We've been hearing enough of that as it is. 


.aa FED4
Maybe we should have some rubber rules of order so we can bend them as  
much as we want.


.aa FED3
I move we check that we have a quorum.  


.aa FED2
We can put up with a modicum of de-quorum.  


.aa FED1
Alas poor quorum I knew him well.   


.aa FED4
Time for roll call. 


.aa FED2
We don't need a roll call, they've got programs.


.aa FED3
Program, program, can't tell your opponent off without a program


.aa FED1
Did we ever have a program? 


.aa FED2
You think that something like this could have been planned?

Chaos dear  
    (one silly, two silly, three silly people)  
We love you 
    (will get us re-elected)
Now it's clear  
 (four rabble, five rabble, six rabble rousers) 
No one knew 
 (no one will ever stop us, once we're through) 
Right, right, right, right; 
We know where we stand, 
Others will know it too.
It's the age-old game   
as narrow minded politicians
Think for me and you....together...

.aa KONG
Oh, too bad there, inmates. If there's ever been an act that accomplished   
so little with so much effort, I can't recall it.   
Sorry boys, I know you don't like that word. (LAUGH TRACK)  
Let's give them a big hand anyway.  


(MAN CARRYING GIANT HAND PROCEEDS TO SWAT DOWN THE FEDS)


(LAUGH TRACK) Oh, God, they love me.
And now for our last act, we have an unnatural act.  I think that's 
about all I can say, take it away Mouldie.

(ENTER GABANDABALF).


.ga 
Excuse me, but I think that I've lost my way.   
I haven't made any headway for an hour. Can you tell me where I am? 


.aa KONG
What? What? Are you a poodle in a garter belt?  


.ga 
What?   


.aa KONG
Are you a poodle in a garter belt?  


.ga 
Where would I put the belt? 


.aa KONG
Good point; then what are you doing here?   


.ga 
I told you, I'm lost.  And what does wearing a garter belt have to do   
with being here?


.aa KONG
This is the King Kong show (LAUGH TRACK) and we were expecting a poodle 
in a garter belt. Well, maybe not a poodle's garter belt, but a 
mad dog's dildo anyway. 


.ga 
All I'm trying to do is find the true page for the Winkle.  


.aa KONG
Well, why didn't you say so in the first place? 
Have we got a page for him, folks. (LAUGH TRACK) Oh, God, they love me  
so much.  Yes, yes.  Leopold, keep quiet, I'm talking.  


.ga 
Do you know about the true page?


.aa KONG
Do I know about the true page? Do I know about the true page, folks?


.aa VOICE   
(FROM THE BACKGROUND) Do you know about the true page?  


.aa KONG
(LOOKS AT RECORDER) Do I know about the true page?  
Son, you've hit the bullseye!   
I   
.ul 
am  
the true page!  Or the real page, as I am known to my friends and admirers. 
(LAUGH TRACK) Oh, they're such good people, and so perceptive, too. 


.ga 
Are you sure you're the true page?  


.aa KONG
Tell him, boys.

A long, long time ago,  
I can still remember    
how the paper used to make me cry;  
And I knew if I had my way  
They would publish what I say,  
And no one would dispute me for a while.
But last September made me quiver,  
with each new issue I would shiver. 
Free news in the hallways,  
It won't be like that always.   
Though some may pout and some may talk  
The campus will forget this shock;  
They'll soon forget who threw the rock  
The day the chevron died.

So, so long to Gabbie and Kong. 
In a year or two we'll say  
that we were right all along
And no one will believe 
that we could ever be wrong;
'Cause power is the tool of the strong, 
Freedom has no place in this song.
