Act 3, Scene 10 - The Schlocks  


.ty 
I don't like these woods Dodo; we must have been walking for hours. 
Wait; there's a sign. "This way to the Schlocks."   
Hmm. I wonder what a schlock is. It 
doesn't sound too dangerous, and if it were, I'm sure the Winkle would have 
told us about them. He seemed to know an awful lot about all the
dangerous things that abound in these woods. (FAR AWAY WOLF 
HOWL.)  Oh, did you hear that Dodo?  Maybe we'd better go to
the schlocks and see if they can help us find the missing   
page.  I see a light up ahead.  


(LIGHTS COME UP ON AN OFFICE WITH GIRL SITTING IN CHAIR.  A 
SIGN AT THE SIDE SAYS "PSYCH SCHLOCK".  TOROTHY AND DODO
ENTER THE CIRCLE OF LIGHT.) 


.ty 
Hello, hello?   


.AA GIRL
Ah yes, hello.  Oh you must be the one bringing the dog over
from the laboratory.  (SHE RUNS OVER TO DODO, RINGS A   
BELL IN HIS EAR, AND FEELS HIS MOUTH.)  That's strange; 
he should be salivating.  Are you sure this dog was trained?
He should react when I tinkle.  



.ty 
He likely would, but he doesn't know anything about bells.  


.AA GIRL
Isn't he the one who they trained over at the lab to
salivate when he heard a bell?  


.ty 
That must be some other dog.  This is Dodo. 


.AA GIRL
I thought they were extinct.  Oh well, what can I do for    
you?


.ty 
Well, you see the Winkle sent us out... 


.AA GIRL
Oh, you must be the people from the Canada Council, 
checking us out on our research.  Well, why didn't  
you say so in the first place?  


.ty 
Well, I...  


.AA GIRL
You see, what we are doing is starting from Lorenz' 
work with imprinting ducklings and carrying on from 
there.  


.ty 
My cousin Elmo used to do that. 


.AA GIRL
Imprint ducklings, or carry on? 


.ty 
Both.   


.AA GIRL
Yes, well.  You see, what Lorenz discouered was that ducklings  
will respond to anything that they have around them at  
one critical period of their development.  If they don't
have a mother around, then they will become attracted   
to some other object, and think of it as their mother:  
an old shoe, a stuffed doll, the experimenter. They 


will follow anything if they are caught at the right
time.  And they will begin to think romantically of 
that object.  After a while, it makes for kind of   
messy shoes if you've been careless leaving them    
around the laboratory, but the concept is FASS-inating. 


.ty 
So? 


.AA GIRL
Well, we've wondered what sort of thing that ducks  
will draw the line at.  And we've been having   
tremendous results. 


.ty 
What sort of things fhave you been using as mother  
substitutes?


.AA GIRL
Old cowboy movies.  


.ty 
Huh?


.AA GIRL
Old cowboy movies.  


.ty 
That's what I though you said.  


.AA GIRL
It's really quite simple.  We just set the ducklings
in front of a closed circuit TV and let them watch the  
action. Also we have a control group that watches   
nothing but re-runs of Hazel.   
For example, this duckling  
(SHE PULLS TRIBBLES, LEMMINGS OUT OF HER DESK AT SHE
NAMES EACH ONE) was bred completely on one of my
favourite TV shows. We call him Bat, Bat Masterduck.
This is Wyatt Duck, here's Bret and Bart Maverduck, 
this is Ronald Duck, with   
his twenty Duck Team Borax, and this is Lareduck
and this is...bother, he's not supposed to be here. 


.ty 
Who's that? 


.aa GIRL
This is one of the ducks that we bred to watch Perry Mason. 
Paul Drake. 
Oh, and here's the pride of our collection. 


.ty 
Who's that? 


.AA GIRL
This is the duck who we started off on watching the 
Cisco Kid.  Remember that old show?  This is Cisco  
Duck.   


.ty 
But I'm not really from the Canada Council.  I'm
really looking for the Winkle's lost page.  


.AA GIRL
Why didn't you say so?  Well, he's not here.  Why   
don't you try over at Arts Schlock.  They have some 
sort of page over there.


.ty 
Thank you.  


(THEY LEAVE.  THE GIRL AT THE DESK SITS DOWN AGAIN, 
AND RINGS THE BELL.  SHE FEELS HER MOUTH FOR SALIVA,
AND SHAKES HER HEAD.)   


(LIGHTS OUT.  LIGHTS UP AGAIN TO FIND TOROTHY AND   
DODO IN EXACTLY THE SAME SITUTAION EXCEPT THAT THE  
SIGN HAS BEEN CHANGED TO ARTS SCHLOCK.) 


.AA GIRL
Hi, there, can I help you?  


.ty 
Yes the Winkle sent me out looking for his true 
page, and the girl at the Psych Scholck told me 
that you had a page here.   


.AA GIRL
That's right.  The Arts Rotarian.   


.ty 
Huh?


.AA GIRL
The Arts Rotarian.  It tell all sorts of things about   
Arts and the Rotary Club.  Kills two birds with one 
stone.  


.ty 
All right, I'll take one.   


.AA GIRL
Great.  Before you go, I'd like to point out that one   
of the poems in it this week is mine.   
I could have it recited to you if you'd like.   


.ty 
(DUBIOUSLY) 
All right.  


.AA GIRL
Here goes.

Ahem, To a Fish.


Oh, fish, lone fish left in your bowl,  
You do not complain, you do not carp
While outside the organ grinder plays   
Weird melodies for his own amusement.   
What good is sitting alone in your bowl 
Come hear the music play
Life is a cabaret old fish, 
Life is a cabaret.

.aa GIRL
How do you like it? It's
real isn't it?  


.ty 
Can't argue with that.  Sorry, I must go, you know. 


.AA GIRL
Say, are you a poet?


(EXIT TOROTHY, PAGE AND DODO.  LIGHTS GO DOWN. LIGHTS COME  
UP) 


.ty 
Well, Dodo, it looks like we have the true page now,
so we can go back to the Winkle.


(ENTER GIRL)


.AA GIRL
Not so fast, sweetibuns.


.ty 
Who are you?  What are you doing in the land of the 
Schlocks?   


.AA GIRL
Sorry, you've got that wrong too, Kiddo.  This isn't
the land of the schlocks, this is the land between  
the Schlocks.  And it's called the swamp of I.S.


.ty 
What does I.S. stand for?   


.AA GIRL
Who knows?  
But you're wrong thinking   
you've got the true page.   
You've got to go to all of the Schlocks,
and even then, you can't be sure that you've
got the true page.  


.ty 
You mean that there are more schlocks than just the 
Arts Schlock interested in the page?


.AA GIRL
Sometimes it doesn't seem that way, but it's true.  
Look, I got to go to my class now, but good luck anyway,
honey.  Oh, blast, I think I left my wicker at home.
    
(LIGHTS DOWN. LIGHTS UP. SIGN SAYING "FASS OFFICE") 


.AA FASS~WRITERS
Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup.....


(LIGHTS DOWN.  LIGHTS UP.  SIGN SAYING MATH SCHLOCK.    
THERE IS THE GIRL THERE, AND SHE IS INTERVIEWING A  
BOY .  ENTER TOROTHY.)  


.ty 
Hello, hello.   


.AA GIRL
Yes, just a minute, I'll be with you in a second. Why   
don't you just sit down on that chair there, and try
to catch something terminal. (TO BOY)  All right,   
where was I?


.aa BOY 
You were explaining why you changed the name.   


.AA GIRL
Well, it was so negative after all.  People were    
saying nasty things about the professors, and that  
just wasn't right so we changed it and called it
Procal.  Doesn't that have a nice ring to it?   


.aa BOY 
I guess.  Can I just fill one out on Prof. Dirichlet
now?  I've been aching to kick him in the drawers   
ever since I got into his class.


.AA GIRL
Now you see, that's the sort of attitude we don't want. 
Let's start.  I liked this professor because: (a) He was
an interesting speaker. (b) He was an all-round 
great guy. (c) He   
showed real concern for everyone in 
the class. (d) He gave great hea-   


.aa BOY 
Wait a second.  I hated the guy.  I want to tear    
him to shreds.  
I don't like the course,
I don't like the professor, I don't like the TA's,  
I don't even like the room that it's held in.  I    
want to be able to tell all the kids in the faculty 
to avoid this stuff like the plague.


.AA GIRL
But that would defeat the purpose of the Procal.
Look, why don't we go on to some of the questions   
that don't deal directly with the course itself.
What mark did you get last year overall?


.aa BOY 
A "B".  


.AA GIRL
Congratulations.  And how old are you?  


.aa BOY 
Twenty. 


.AA GIRL
How tall are you?   


.aa BOY 
Ahh, five foot ten.  Say what-  


.AA GIRL
And does your mother drink to excess?   


.aa BOY 
Look, I just came here to fill out a professor evaluation   
form, I didn't expect the Spanish Inquisition.  


(DEAD SILENCE.  THE THREE ON STAGE STAY FROZEN FOR A FULL   
FIVE SECONDS, LOOKING OUT STAGE LEFT. THE GIRL SHRUGS)  
ANOTHER FIVE SECONDS.  THE GIRL SHRUGS.)


.AA GIRL
Hmmm.  Well, I guess that's all then.  Do you want a    
copy of last year's Procal? 


.aa BOY 
I guess so. 


.ty 
I'd like one too please.


.AA GIRL
Oh, is that all you're here for?  All right, here it is.


.aa PAGE2   

(BABBLES INCOHERENTLY)  


.aa GIRL
You might notice that it's completely incomprehensible. 
That's one of the little drawbacks of the format that we
chose, but that's really very minor.
Would you like a game of Risk before you go?


.ty 
Thank you, but no; I don't take chances.


(LIGHTS OUT.  LIGHTS UP.  TOROTHY IS STANDING IN FRONT  
OF A SIGN SAYING IGN SCHLOCK.  AUDIBLE ALL AROUND THE   
STAGE ARE FARTING SOUNDS.)  


.ty 
Ign Schlock.  I wonder what Ign stands for. 


.AA GIRL
(ENTERING)  It's short for Ignorant, and that's the sort
of noise that we make.  (SHE BLOWS ON HER ARM, WHICH    
MAKES THE FARTING SOUND.)   


.ty 
You mean to tell me that all you do is sit around all   
day making ignorant noises? 


.AA GIRL
It's a living.  


.ty 
That may be fine for academics, but how do you expect   
to get a job in the outside world if you ever leave 
the schlock.


.AA GIRL
Oh, there's a lot of call for ignorant noises in the
outside world.  They tape-record us for whoopee cushions.   
We make the static on the P.A. systems in bus stations. 
Car backfires.  Trains shunting.  Background vocals for 
Rod Stewart.


.ty 
I see.  


.aa GIRL
It's a good training program.   


(ENTER THE EIGHT ENGINEERS IN DRAG.  THEY ARE ALL INDULGING 
IN STRANGE SOUNDS AND POSES.)   


.aa GIRL
These are the pride of Ign Schlock, the Ign Pages.  They are
by far the most ingenious igneers that we have. 


.ty 
Good grief, it's a schlock wave.


.aa GIRL
Please try to be civil with them.  It might just look mechanical to 
you right now, but when the chemistry is right, 
they're positively electrifying.


.ty 
I think they have designs on me.


(ONE IS ATTEMPTING TO UNDRESS HER.) 


I don't suppose that you can let me have one.   


.aa PAGES   
Me - me - take me!  


.aa GIRL
Sure. Here's a copy.


(TOROTHY TAKES IT)

There once was a man from Nantucket, whose- 


.ty 
(QUICKLY COVERING THE PAGE'S MOUTH) 
Yes, if this is the true page I can see why the Winkle  
might want it back.  I don't think that he'd like word to   
get out about the sort of things he gets a kick 
out of. 
No, no, Dodo. Bad dog.  


(SHE KICKS THE DOG OVER AND IT FALLS ON ITS SIDE.  LIGHTS FADE.)
