Matilda suitably chastised?  Or did the Munchkins decide
that the People's Bilingual Daily Gazette had been right

 Overture, hit the lights,  
 This is it, the night of nights,   
 No more rehearsing, thank God it's all done
 The only thing left is fun....da dada dadada

 This is it, we'll hit the heights, 
 And oh what heights we'll hit, 
 On with the show this is it.   
 On with the show this is it.
