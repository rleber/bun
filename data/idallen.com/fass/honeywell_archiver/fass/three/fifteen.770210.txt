Act III, Scene 15 - The Climax  


(IN THE WINKLE'S PALACE; THE WINKLE IS PRACTISING.) 


.wi 
Brassiere!! 


.rb 
Where?  


.wi 
You!


.rb 
Oh, yeah.   


.wi 
And I see you are not alone.


.rb 
Of course not; you're here too.  Oh, you mean those two.
I've been dragging them around for so long that 
I'd forgotten they were with me.  I suppose you're  
wondering why I'm here. 


.wi 
Not particularly.   


.rb 
Oh? Well, I'll tell you anyway.  My bosom buddies have  
told me that they're interested in magic.  And as long  
as I'm keeping them hostage, I figured I might as   
well keep them amused too, so I came here.  


.wi 
You've come to the right place. 


(BEGINS FINGER ROUTINE.)


.rb 
No, what they really wanted to see was the handcuff and 
lampshade trick.


.pd 
We did? 


.pz 
Handcuffs?  So we were right about that bondage thing he's got. 


.wi 
Despite my encyclopaedic knowledge of the realm of  
prestidigitation, I must confess that I have never heard
of the handcuff and lampshade illusion.  Could you  
please describe it? 


.rb 
Well. it's quite simple really.  We simply  
handcuff you behind your back and place a lampshade on your 
head.  Then without the slightest movement, you 
mysteriously extend your lifespan by thirty 
thousand years until the handcuffs rust into nothingness
and the lampshade is shrunk by the elements into
a yarmukka.     


.wi 
Oh, you mean the lampshade and handcuffs illusion.  Trust   
an amateur to get the name wrong.   


.pd 
Then you've heard of it?


.wi 
Certainly my child.  My teacher, the great Fettacini
was a pasta master of this trick.  He once performed it 
before the high council of Munchkins.   


.pd 
Did he  succeed?


.wi 
I was thinking of checking up on him next October.  When
shall we start? 


.rb 
Now! There's no time like the present.  


.wi 
Very well.  Your handcuffs or mine? 


.rb 
Allow me.   


(HE PUTS THE HANDCUFFS ON THE WINKLE AND THEN THE LAMPSHADE.
THERE IS A SILENCE OF ABOUT TWO SECONDS.)   


.pz 
Thirty thousand years, eh?  I hope there's an intermission. 


.rb 
And now for my foolproof disguise.  


(PUTS ON THE BOFFER GLASSES; DOES NOT PUT ON THE WINKLES
ROBE, BUT MIGHT PUT ON THE HAT. 
ENTER TOROTHY, DODO, SURU, TOLSTOY, GABANDABALF FROM ALL
ENTRANCES. RB LOOKS ALL AROUND) 
So you're back. 


.aa ALL 
Yes and I've got the true page.  (PAUSE)  No,   
.ul 
I've
got the true page.  


.rb 
Well, one of you is sure to have the true page.  I'll   
leaf through them in a minute.  


.su 
What about our ring modulator?  


.rb 
What about your ring modulator? 


.su 
Do we get it or not?


.rb 
Certainly you get it!  Form a daisy chain.  


.ty 
Okay, but Dodo goes beside someone else.


.rb 
No, you don't understand!  Ring modulators run wild on  
Fed, so we have to hold hands in a circle with our backs
to the centre to create a Ring Modulator vortex which   
will suck in a ring modulator.  


.pd 
I don't think ring modulators are the only things   
being sucked in.


(THEY JOIN HANDS TO FORM A CIRCLE.) 



.rb 
Now I take this length of special conductive rope and   
wrap it around you securely to channel the lines of 
inductive force through the domain of curved topological
space.....  


(HE WRAPS THEM UP IN THE ROPE, CLEARLY TAKING GREAT 
PLEASURE IN THE TASK.)  


.pd 
You know there's something extraordinarily sporting about   
these Pederasty people. 


.pz 
Handcuffs, tying us up, and now this.  What's   
next?   


.to 
Say, there are the boobies!  What are they doing here?  


.ga 
They look like they're trying to trap a little ring modulator.  


.to 
We don't need a little one.  We need a full-size....


(COMMUNICATOR BLEEPS.)  


.to 
Yes, Satirize?  Tolstoy here.   


.jo 
Oh, wow, hey man, what you doing in that little box?


.to 
Mr.Jock?


.st 
Don't mind him, Tolstoy.  What we wanted to tell you was that   
Lt.Huaryu has found a ring modulator and so you don't need to   
look any further.   


.jo 
Is that you Tolstoy?  Oh, man, how's it going, buddy?   


.to 
Huaru has found a ring modulator?  But we're with the   
Winkle now getting one from him.




.st 
Well, however you get it, we've figured out a way to get it 
up. 


.to 
Is Yeoman Randy up there with you?  


.st 
Why do you ask? 


.to 
Never mind. 


.jo 
Oh, I get it; Spotty, you said....  


.st 
Quiet Jock.  Just be prepared.  We'll be picking up 
the modulator in a few minutes. 


.to 
Right.  Well, it appears that  we don't have to worry about 
this anymore.  We can leave things up to Huaryu.


.ty 
My name is Torothy and this is my dog Dodo. 


.rb 
Be quiet you people, or you'll scare
away her ring modulator too.  Shhh, she's coming.  Now  
don't say anything, or we'll lose the one that we've
got.


(ENTER HUARYU AND LEFTY.)   


.aa ALL 
Shhhhhhhhh. 


.hu 
(WHISPERING)
What's happening?   


.rb 
Thank God you haven't lost it yet!!!!   


.hu 
(OUT LOUD)  
And THAT hasn't been easy with the Captain around.  


.aa ALL 
Shhhhhh!!!  


.hu 
(COWERING)  
What's the matter?  


.su 
We're whispering so we don't scare away your ring modulator.


.rb 
Tell you what.  Just hold still and we'll tie it to you.  Lefty 
do you want to give her a hand. 


.le 
Last time I tried that, she kicked me in the bicep.  Oh, well,  
nothing ventured,....   


(BRASSIERE TIES THEM UP WITH THE RING MODULATOR.)   


(A ROPE APPEARS FROM THE SKY.)  


.rb 
At last we can talk.  What's this?  (GRABS NOTE 
TIED TO THE ROPE.)  Let's see.  "Like wow, man, 
this is...uhh...this is....uhhhh....I'm like supposed   
to write you a message about.... wow man, there's blue ink  
coming out of the end of one of my fingers, wow, oh yeah,   
like...."   Mr.Tolstoy...   


.to 
Right.  (COMMUNICATOR) Mr.Spot, could you explain the purpose   
of this rope and the message.   


.st 
I had Mr.Jock drop you a rope to tie the Ring Modulator 
to with a message to explain what it was for.   


.hu 
We all know what a ring modulator's for.


.ty 
I don't.


.st 
No, the rope.   


.ga 
What's it for?  


.st 
To tie the ring modulator to!  And then we grab this
end of the rope and pull it ....oh dear.


.jo 
Oh, hey, man, I'm sorry.... 


.st 
We'll get back to you.  


.wi 
Somebody check the handcuffs; I think they're starting  
to rust.


.ty 
What was that?  


.rb 
Oh, didn't I tell you?  Lamps run free on Fed as well.  


.ty 
That must really cut your hydro bills.  


(ENTER JERK WITH THE PAGE.) 


.pd 
Oh, Captain, you're back!!  


.je 
What about my  back?
(HE LOOKS.) 


.rb 
Here, Let's see.  Oh, that looks bad Jim.  Quick,   
stand up against this wall while I tie you to the operating 
table.  


(JERK DOES.  HE IS TIED UP FACING THE WALL.)


.je 
Boy, it's a good thing for me that you were here, Doctor
McIntosh.  McIntosh!


.aa VORTEX  
McIntosh!!!!


.aa LEFTY~AND~HUARU 
McIntosh!!!!


.aa PRIZE~AND~PRIDE 
(MATTER OF FACTLY.) 
Yes, McIntosh.  


.rb 
No, Brassiere.  


.je 
Brassiere!!!!   


.rb 
All right, enough of that.  


.aa VORTEX  
(Whisper)   
Brassiere.  


.rb 
I heard that!!! 


.su 
If you're Brassiere, where's the Winkle?


.wi 
Right here!  Pretty snazzy trick, eh, Suru? 


.to 
Quick Winkle; it's a trap.  


.wi 
A trap!  I should have known when you got the name of that  
trick wrong.


.ga 
Illusion, Perry, illusion.  


.je 
Whatever.   


.wi 
You'd better be long gone Brassiere by the time that I rust off 
these handcuffs.


.rb 
I will be.  They're wood.   


.wi 
Wood!  Wooden you know!  What a sap I've been.  


.rb 
Yes and now I'm taking over the planet and nothing can stop me.

.aa MATILDA 
(ENTERING WITH A CUP OF HOT CHOCOLATE)  
Not so fast Brassiere; just hold it right there, I've   
got you covered.


.rb 
Hot chocolate!!!


.aa MATILDA 
Yes!  And now I'm taking over the planet and nothing can
stop me.  At last power is mine!  Hahaha.  Drat, there doesn't  
seem to be any rope left.  Wait, what's this?   


(ROPE COMES DOWN FROM THE SHIP AGAIN.)  


Perfect.

Every time I've looked at you   
I've not comprehended   
What your plans for power were, 
Just what you intended. 
Guess it doesn't matter 
Now you've been apprehended,
Tough luck, Brassiere,  
I hope I haven't offended.  
.in8
.fi 


.rb 
Sit on it, Woundwort.   
(THE ROPE THAT HE IS TIED TO WHICH HAS BEEN MOVING  
ACROSS THE STAGE WHILE THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON, NOW  
DRAGS HIM COMPLETELY AWAY.) 


.aa MATILDA 
So now, I am supreme ruler of Fed.  


.aa ERIC~ONE
Not so fast Matilda.  Just hold it right there!  WE've  
got you all surrounded.  We're taking over the planet now   
and nothing can stop us!


(EVERYBODY WHO IS NOT A MUNCHKIN IS TIED UP.)   


.AA ERIC~ONE
We the Munchkin Republican Army, or the MRA, have been on to you
all, and your little schemes for quite a while.  We were
only waiting for the Boobies to get here before we  
stepped in.  Now we've got everything we'll need
so you people are of no use to us anymore.  


.je 
Gabandabalf, what are we going to do?   


.ga 
What mean "we", white man?  


.aa ERIC~ONE
You're one of them too.  You'll go with the 
rest of them.   


.ga 
Well, in that case..... 


.je 
You can't do this and get away with it!  We are 
representatives of the Pederasty!  You're inviting  
open warfare.  The Pederasty will avenge our deaths.


.aa ERIC~ONE
Shut your face, you snivelling little coward.  Your beloved 
Pederasty can't even remember to put washrooms on a 
starship - oh yes, we know - how do you expect them to  
find you in uncharted space?  Now, as I was saying, 
we'll have to get rid of the lot of you.


.je 
They're going to run us over with a truck!  


.aa ERIC~ONE
No, we're going to lance the head Munchkin, shoot up Lefty, 
and for the rest of you, the Munchkin Death Grip.   


.aa ALL 
The Munchkin Death Grip!!!!!!!  


.ty 
What's the Munchkin Death Grip? 


.aa ERIC~ONE
We will demonstrate on one of your crew members.


(THEY DRAG OUT THE ECM.)


.je 
How did he get here?


.aa ERIC~ONE
And now the MUNCHKIN DEATH GRIP!!!!!


(THEY DEMONSTRATE.) 


.hu 
How horrible!   


.aa ERIC~ONE
We think so.    


(BRASSIERE IS DRAGGED ACROSS THE STAGE AGAIN.)  


We'll catch him the next time the ship comes around.
As for  the rest of you, it is already too late!!!!!!!!!
