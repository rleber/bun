Act 3, Scene 2 - At the Winkle's


(LARGE CASTLE-TYPE ROOM. BRASSIERE ENTERS HOLDING ROPE ATTACHED 
TO BOOBIES. THEY HOP INTO THE ROOM, STILL TIED BACK TO BACK)


.rb 
Come along, I haven't got all day! The Satirize crew will be
here any second, and I don't think they'd take it too kindly    
if they knew they were being spied upon.


(SOUND OF APPROACHING FELLOWSHIP)   


Drat! Quick, behind this doorway, and not a word out of you.


(THE FELLOWSHIP ENTERS) 


.ty 
So this is how a Winkle lives. It's awfully large - by Munchkin 
standards. That main doorway must have been all of 5 feet high. 


.je 
Feet?   


.su 
An archaic system of measurement used in mediaevil Earth, sir.  
I'd estimate roughly 3 Galactic Standard cubits.

FREE ORIFICE IN TIME TO THE FOLLOWING VERSE)

     Diddle-iddle-um, da-da.
     Diddle-iddle-um, da-da.
     Prepare for the Winkle of Fed. (4 TIMES)   


(DURING THE COURSE OF THIS SONG THE WINKLE HAS ENTERED QUIETLY AND  
IS STANDING WITH THE FELLOWSHIP, WAITING FOR HIS BIG ENTRANCE.  
IT DOESN'T COME, OF COURSE) 


.wi 
(TO TOROTHY) Pretty snazzy intro, eh, kid?  


.ty 
Huh?


.wi 
I said pretty snazzy intro, eh? Really builds up the excitement for 
my big entry.   


.ty 
Your big entry? You mean you're the Winkle of Fed?  


.wi 
You were expecting maybe Phil Silvers? Really, Torothy. 


.ty 
How did you know my-


.wi 
How did I know your name?   
Oh, I know all about you and the rest of the Fellowship; how you
crashed here and why you've come to see me. 


.ga 
Hi, Perry.  


.wi 
Hi, Gabby.  


.je 
You know each other?


.ga 
Sure, we're buddies from way back. Perry used to use me in his  
magic show : I was in the guillotine trick. 


.wi 
Illusion, Gabby, illusion. There are no tricks in my show.  


.je 
Show? What's all this about a show? 


.wi 
This show!  


(GESTURES TO MUNCKINS. THEY SMILE)  


Now right here is where 
I make my big entrance, and then we bring on the
Banana Act and I do my magic routine.   


.su 
What's a Ba-


.wi 
What's a Banana Act?
I was hoping someone would ask me that. (CALLS OFFSTAGE)
Bring on the Banana Act!


(JUGGLERS AND MAGIC ACT)


.wi 
(TO TOROTHY) Pretty snazzy act, eh, kid?
Now let's see; you're here because you want a ring modulator, right?


.je 
Right.  


.wi 
You need the ring modulator to fix your transporter, right? 


.je 
Right.  


.wi 
You want me to get you one, right?  


.je 
Right. You can help us, right?  


.wi 
Wrong.  


.je 
Wrong?  


.wi 
Yes. Good day! (STARTS TO LEAVE)


.ga 
Just a second, Wink old buddy.  


(THE REST OF THE FELLOWSHIP WINKS; LEFTY SNAPS HIS FINGERS) 


In these days of social unrest and revolutionary fervour, do you
think it's wise to admit that there's something you can't do?   


(AT THE SOUND OF THESE WORDS TOLSTOY'S EYES LIGHT UP)   


.wi 
There's nothing I can't do. 


.ga 
Look: you know there's nothing you can't do, and I know 
there's nothing you can't do, but all the Munchkins will
know is that you can't even supply these people with a lousy ring   
modulator.  


.je 
Actually, we'd like a fairly good one if it's at all possible.  


.wi 
Well... 


.to 
What's all this about "social unrest and revolutionary f-   


.wi 
Social unrest and revolutionary fervour?
Nothing, nothing.   


.ga 
Nothing!
Threats are made on your life every day, and you're on the verge
of being thrown out of office by your people and you say "Nothing." 


.wi 
Well, when you put it that way... all right, I'll get you your ring 
modulator, but first you must do something for me. You must find -  
my page!


.hu 
You mean you don't have the script memorized yet?   


(BY THIS TIME SURU IS ASLEEP)   


.ga 
Not that kind of page, my dear. The Winkle is talking about a   
flesh and blood, human page.


.hu 
Wait until Jock finds out! He can finally write his book.   


.ga 
I don't think you get my meaning. You see, the page is the only 
means of mass communication on the planet Fed. They travel everywhere,  
telling the Munchkins things like what kind of beer to buy, where   
to go for birth control devices and termpapers and such, and what   
movies to avoid.


.ty 
Is that all?


.wi 
Practically. Every week they make their rounds, spreading opinion   
and gossip far and wide.


(TOLSTOY IS NOW ASLEEP) 


.hu 
Is there no way to simply get the plain f-  


.wi 
Get the plain  facts on this planet?
Certainly there's the true page.


(HUARYU OPENS HER MOUTH TO SPEAK)   


What's the true page? It's what I want you to find! 
It's the only page that the people completely trust,
and I can't keep their support unless I have it.


.je 
You mean you want us to-


.wi 
Exactly. I want you to split up and sarch the woods for the true
page. Bring it back to me, and I'll get you your ring modulator.


(HUARYU IS ASLEEP)  


.je 
How will we-


.wi 
How will you recognize the true page? It's easy: he has absolutely  
no distinguishing characteristics. Oh, and another thing. Watch out 
for this man.   


(PULLS OUT PICTURE FRAME BEHIND WHICH BRASSIERE IS STANDING)


.je 
Macintosh!  


.wi 
Huh? You know-  


.je 
Do I know this person? Sure I do! He was on my ship and stole my
boobies.


.wi 
I'm afraid I'm somewhat puzzled by your race's anatomy. Could   
you please clarify what you're saying?  


.je 
(QUICKLY)   
He posed as our doctor, stole our passengers, escaped and came down to  
the planet with us, and ran off in the confusion when   
we found our nurse turned into a pizza. 


.wi 
(DAZED) Thanks for the clarification. Would you like to know-   


.je 
(YAWN) Yes, I'd like to know who he really is.  


.wi 
I wish you wouldn't interrupt me.   
His real name is Robert Brassiere, and he's my arch enemy,  
the man who's trying to overthrow me. He's pretty violent,  
and there's no telling what he might do if he found 
out you were helping me.


(JERK IS ASLEEP)


(YAWN) I suggest you and your people split up. There are
quite a few places in and around the forest where you can check...  
(YAWN)... and then you can get back to me....ZZZZZZZZZZZ


(WINKLE IS ASLEEP)  
.rb 
(LEAVES FRAME) So, they hope to get the page, do they?  
They'll never find it before me! I'll have this planet  
up in arms before they know what hit them, and  
with the boobies and the true page in my power the people   
will acclaim me their ruler. Haha!  


(EVERYONE STARTS TO WAKE UP. BRASSIERE LEAVES)  


.to 
Keptain, was that you?  


.je 
I thought it was you. Oh well, no time to waste. Let's be off!  


.to 
Where are we going? 


.je 
Off to the forest to find the page. 


.su 
What's a page?  


.hu 
And why are we going to a forest?   


.ty 
Captain, could you repeat some of what was said? Dodo didn't hear   
all of it.  


.to 
(EYES LIGHT UP) Yes, start at the part about "social unrest and 
revolutionary fervour". 


.je 
Something tells me this is going to be a long day.  


(FADEOUT)
