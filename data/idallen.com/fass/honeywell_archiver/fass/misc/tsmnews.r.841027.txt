THEATRESPORTS   
.ti 5   
Theatresports is an improvisational comedy group that puts on a regular 
weekly show featuring performers from the University and beyond.  It originated 
in Calgary, and has since spread across Canada and picked up an enormous following.

Theatresports involves two teams of performers who take turns improvising   
entertaining scenes based on suggestions from an audience.  
A set of three judges scores the scenes on how entertaining they were, and  
so the teams compete to produce the best and most exciting scenes they can. 
The result is lots of fun, for the audience and for the performers.

Improvisation means working without a script, without a set, without anything   
but your wits and your imagination.  It doesn't take brains, it just takes  
creativity; if you want to find out more, come out to a Theatresports workshop. 
We can teach you everything you need to know to perform on-stage without a  
script and survive; in fact, more than survive.  We can't guarantee you'll be   



















another Robin Williams, but we can guarantee that you'll have a heck of a lot of
fun.

Theatresports is always looking for new performers, so if you have a sense  
of humour and enjoy performing in front of people, this may be just the 
place for you.  If you're not a performer at heart, come on out and watch   
the fun anyway.  The time and place changes from time to time to keep our   
audiences on their toes, so be sure to check the Imprint (the campus newspaper) 
for details.
