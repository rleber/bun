Director's Message: 
{tp}
Well kids, we did it.   
We took a brilliantly crafted script and made it come alive, all in 
the space of three brief (too brief!) weeks.
And it's been fun, hasn't it?   
I don't know how to begin to express my thanks to you all for making
these past weeks so special, but Lynn assures me I have to try, 
so here goes:   
{tp}
To the writers for the dedication through the months when FASS is   
just another four-letter word; to the techies for the wonderful sets,   
the invaluable assistance, and the sound and lights that make us
look so good; and to the cast, whose energy and enthusiasm made 
directing FASS '86 a real joy.

Cheers!  Suzanne

P.S. Have a good time out there!
