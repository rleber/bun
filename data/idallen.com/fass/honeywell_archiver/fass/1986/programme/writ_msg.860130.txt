Chief Scriptwriter's Message:   
{tp}
Writing {it}FASS '86: The Scream Play{ro} took nine months. 
I've heard that childbirth is more painful, but this baby's funnier.
{tp}
The knack to being Chief Scriptwriter is knowing what to leave out  
("Oh no, penguins!"), what to cut out (Union Carbide),  
and whom to single out: 
special thanks to that loyal band of writers who stuck  
by me all those long nights in December,
particularly Dave Till, William Hughes and Jim Gardner. 
Thank you, guys, for not saying,
"Whaddya mean, you want to add thirty characters by Monday??!!!"
