President's Message:
{tp}
Let me take this moment to say thanks to all of you.
To all who lent their talent and support to this year's show, there 
is no need to emphasize how much your contributions have meant. 
It is the goal and purpose of FASS to provide a meeting place for   
people of different backgrounds and interests.  
In this vein, I feel that this year has been an overwhelming success.   
I'm sure that all of us will carry in our hearts some of the
magic moments that have made this year so memorable and special.
