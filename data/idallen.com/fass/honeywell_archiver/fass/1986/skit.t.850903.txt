Hi dollface, where have you been all my life?

Ohhhh, oh, oh oh, In the longest line...
.ve 5   
I've been waiting here since Monday night.  
Not long 'till I've finals I must write. (ah-ah-ah) 
It's now September  
I will be there by December 
For now I'm waiting in longest line.
.ve 5   
Once I thought I'd make a class or two. 
Now I know I've other things to do. 
Oh my elation...
Learning about registration,
And that means waiting in the longest line. 
.ve 2   
Oh, oh, oh, oh, in the longest line...  
Oh, oh, oh, in the longest line.
.ve 5   
I just love this waiting in the hall,   
Just to change my courses for the fall. 
And then rejection  
When you ask for special sections.  
Back to the last place in the longest line. 
.ve 5   
Maybe I'll get out by next week.
I've not shaved in days, they think I'm a freak.
I should bank somewhere else you know.. 
Why should I wait an hour   
Just to find I'm at zero
.ve 5   
Who knows how much further this goes on?
When I get there all the books are gone.
What are the chances,   
I'll remember what romance is   
When I have made it through the longest line.   
.ve 5   
I just bought three things at the mart  
The woman ahead has got a full cart.
Dozens are stuck in this bottleneck 
We're in the express line,  
and she's paying with a che -- que. 
.ve 4   
I don't care what consequence it brings.
I will shoot her if when she buys those things. 
I'm off the deep end, at least I know I won't spend 
My whole life waiting in the longest line...
