Act 1, Scene 16 - The Celebrated Beam Joke Scene


(THE COMPANY STEPS OUT OF THE FARMHOUSE ONE BY ONE. DODO IS HOPPING 
UP AND DOWN)


.je 
Tell Dodo that he can stop now. 


.su 
How do you feel, Captain.   


.je 
With much dexterity.


.hu 
Sounds sinister to me.  (DUSTS OFF HER BOOBS.)  


.je 
Here, let me help you with those.... I mean that.   


.ty 
Thank heavens we all made it!   


.hu 
The captain is still trying to make it. 


.to 
Keptain, I'm afraid we have a casualty.  Look what I found  
in the washroom.


.je 
Ensign! That's disgusting!  


.to 
No it's not, it's Nurse Chappedlips.


.je 
Well, tell her to take it back! 


.to 
No, Keptain, it IS Nurse Chappedlips.   


.hu 
It looks more like a pizza. 


.je 
I always said she was a crusty old broad.   


.cl 
Who are you calling old?


.hu 
Who said that?  


.cl 
I did.  


.je 
Nurse Chappedlips? What does this mean? 


.cl 
I'm not dead!!!  I'm just depressed - but I'm getting better.   


.su 
You don't look too peppy.   


.cl 
You're no delight yourself. 


.su 
You always were a saucy little tomato.  


.cl 
Look, I'm getting pretty cheesed off at you; quit cutting   
me up and get me a doctor.  


.je 
Doctor! I almost forgot.


.to 
Keptain, Macintosh seems to have made off with the pizzas - 
I mean the Boobies. 


.je 
Drat! (WHIPS IT OUT.) Jock, are you there?  


.jo 
No, I'm here.  What is it, Captain? 


.je 
Jock, I - I don't know how to break this to you, but
Nurse Chappedlips is a pizza pie.   


.jo 
That's rather tasteless, Captain.   


.je 
I wouldn't know, Jock. You're the one who hangs around with her.


.jo 
I get the feeling you're trying to tell me something.   


.je 
Nothing you don't know already, Jock.   


.ty 
Captain Jerk, Captain Jerk! Look, off into the distance.
It looks like a short cloud of dust.


.je 
Don't be silly, Torothy.  Jock, analyse that phenomenon 
off in front of us. 



.jo 
Captain, you're not going to believe this - 


.je 
It's not a short cloud of dust?!


.jo 
No, Captain, it appears to be a cloud of short dust......   
and an extremely dangerous one at that! 


.je 
How can you tell?   


.jo 
I've looked at that cloud from both sides now, from up and down, and
still somehow - 


.je 
I think I can guess the rest, Jock. 


.to 
He's right, Keptain, I think we're in danger.   


.je 
How can you tell?   


.to 
(OUT OF ACCENT?) That sign over there that says "Welcome to Danger".


.hu 
We'd better get out fast.   


.je 
How can you tell?   


.hu 
That cloud of dust is on the other side of the farm house.  


.je 
But we're on the OTHER side of the farm house.  


.hu 
That's why we'd better get out fast!


.je 
(CONFUSED PAUSE) We'd better get out fast! Quick Jock, beam us aboard!  




.su 
We can't, Captain. It's too dangerous!  


.je 
(SHAKESPEARIANISTICALLY) It's ... too dangerous HERE!   




.hu 
They're getting closer, Captain.


.je 
If we stay here another second it's certain death.  
If we try to use the transporter it's certain death.


.ty 
It's starting to rain!  


.je 
That settles it! We use the transporter. Quick, Jock, beam us aboard!   


(A BOARD IS BEAMED TO THEM. BLACKOUT)
