Act I, Scene 14 - The Farm House


(WE OPEN ON A LINE CONSISTING OF HUARU, SURU, CHAPPEDLIPS   
AND TOLSTOY IN FRONT OF THE DOOR; ALL STAND 
IMPATIENTLY.  MEANWHILE, BRASSIERE STANDS DISGRUNTLED   
HOLDING A PHASER ON THE TWO BOOBIES, TIED BACK TO BACK. 
TOROTHY AND DODO SIT ON THE STEPS, TOROTHY CONSOLING DODO.) 


.pz 
Pride, look at the Satirize crew members.   


(THEY HOP AROUND A HALF TURN AFTER THIS AND FOLLOWING LINES OF  
THEIR CONVERSATION SO THAT WHOEVER IS TALKING IS FACING THE CREW MEMBERS)   


.pd 
It's incredible.  What can they be doing?   


(HALF TURN) 


.pz 
I would guess that it's some form of primitive  
worship, seeking the blessing of a god upon their   
efforts.


(HALF TURN) 


.pd 
So that's what Ensign Tolstoy meant about paying
a visit to the Great White Telephone.   


(HALF TURN) 


.pz 
Telephone worship?  What a bunch of dingalings.  (PAUSE)
I suppose the Captain is waiting for some sort of sign  
before he comes out.


(FLUSHING SOUND IS HEARD.  CAPTAIN COMES OUT OF THE HEAD,   
DOING UP HIS FLY.  DODO HOWLS. HUARU RUSHES IN, OTHERS GRIMACE.)


.je 
All right, whoever you are; we've done our share -- that
is, we've come over here to negotiate.  Now tell us what you
want for the Boobies' safety: make us a proposition.


.br 
Really, Captain, I'm flattered, but you're really not   
my type.  Now Nurse Chappedlips.......  


.je 
Nurse, come here.   


.cl 
I can't.


.je 
You what?   


.cl 
I said I can't! I'l lose my place in line!  


.je 
Nurse Chappedlips, the lives of two people are at stake,
not to mention the energy reserves of the entire
Pederasty.  Now get over here!  


(CHAPPEDLIPS, POUTING, GOES OVER.)  


(TOLSTOY RUBS HIS HANDS WITH GLEE AND TAKES HER PLACE IN LINE.  
TOILET FLUSHES AND DODO HOWLS.  HUARU EXITS AND SURU
GOES INSIDE.)   


.je 
Torothy, can't you control that animal of yours?


.ty 
He can't help it. He's in agony.


.je 
Agony? What's the matter?  You didn't feed him some 
of those Tang biscuits back on the ship did you?


.ty 
Just a few Captain; he was SO hungry.  And now he's got 
to go for a walk awful bad. 


.je 
Well, take him for one then.


.hu 
Captain, you can't be serious.  Here we are, high over  
a strange planet in a two-storey farmhouse at an altitude   
of over thirty thousand miles!  And you're suggesting that  
Torothy put a leash on that dog-


.ty 
Oh, Dodo, doesn't need a leash.  He'sh shubletting. 


.hu 
You're suggesting that Torothy walk her dog out that front  
door and off into empty space?  


.ty 
Actually, we've got a verandah. 


.hu 
But Torothy, you don't understand, there's a vaccuum out there. 


.ty 
There's one in here too.  We had a broom, but Miss Esquimillara 
de Quentavo Francesca d'Anconia Ramalamadingdong Smith  
down the road borrowed it when she flew to Hawaii over the holidays.


.pz 
Smartass kid.   


.hu 
No, Torothy, what I mean is, there's no air out there.  If  
you tried to walk out that door, you'd burst like a rubber....  
balloon.


.ty 
Captain! How horrible.  


.je 
It was just an idea. (SHRUGS)  I guess we can let him use the facilities.   
Nurse!!!!   Just



(SHE HAS BEEN EDGING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE WASHROOM. 
SHE FREEZES.)   


Get back here!!!!!! 


(SHE COMPLIES.  FLUSH, HOWL, TOLSTOY COMES OUT OF   
WASHROOM, TOROTHY AND DODO GO INSIDE, TOROTHY HOLDING   
DODO UP INTO A SUGGESTIVE POSITION.)


.je 
Now, where were we, my bogus Bones? 


(COMMUNICATOR BLEEPS - JERK ANSWERS.)   


.je 
Jerk here, what is it Spotty?   


.jo 
This is Jock, Captain.  


.je 
All right then, Jock.   


.st 
Spotty here sir, what did you want? 


.je 
Jock!   


.st 
Carnally, sir?  


.je 
Just put him on!


.st 
The doctor's been doing that for weeks - he's convinced him 
that the computer's going to have a baby.   


.je 
(GETTING ANNOYED) Spotty......  


.jo 
No sir, this is Jock.   


.je 
Well?   


.jo 
I'm fine sir, but this isn't a social call.  I have 
some good news and some bad news.  First the bad news:  
the added weight of you and the crew members in that
farm house has proved a bit much for our tractor beams. 
I'm afraid you're breaking loose and falling to the planet  
below.  

Just

.je 
Breaking loose!  Can't you do anything, Spotty? 


.st 
It's no use,  Captain.  We can't hold you any longer!   


.je 
They're not going to like this back at Star Flit Command when   
they find out that we lost a planetful of silicon just  
because you couldn't keep a measley little split-level  
in orbit.   


.jo 
Correction, Captain, the building you are currently 
occupying is a two-storey frame dwelling of early   
twentieth century - 


.je 
Save it, Jock.  Just give me the good news. 


.jo 
Well sir,  apparently the spy sabotaged the transporter so that 
we can't beam you off the farmhouse before it crashes into the  
planet below, killing you all.  


.je 
That's your good news?  


.jo 
No,  that's YOUR good news. 


(TOROTHY AND DODO FLUSH THE TOILET, AND CHAPPEDLIPS HITS THE CAN.)  


.st 
Correction Mr.Jock, we can use the transporter; the spy just destroyed  
the ring modulator. As a result we COULD beam up the crew in bits an bytes. 


.je 
Well, that's a whole new ball game.  I don't suppose that you   
could start with Dodo?  


(TOROTHY CRIES) 


Just joking, my dear

Just joking, my dear.  Well, what can we do?


.ty 
Captain, I once read something back home in our local   
newspaper, the Kansas City - Wichita Courier Bugle Post 
Dispatch World Times Sun Weekly - in Slanderous Ann's column.   
It said that if you're in a falling elevator, you can jump up   
and down, and that way you get a 50-50 chance of being in the   
air when the thing crashes.  You see, if you're up in the   
air when it hits the ground, you won't be hurt. 


.je 
That's great! Jock, do you think that you can beam over an elevator 
big enough for all of us?   


.jo 
I believe the house will do admirably, sir.  I have calculated  
the exact time of your crash, and so if you will    
simply jump up and down as I direct you, I believe that 
you will be all right.  Ready?  


.aa ALL 
Ready!!!


.jo 
Up, down, up, down, up, down, up, up, up, up.....   


.je 
For Chissakes give us a down!!!!!   


.jo 
Downdowndownup, down, up, down... (CONTINUES)   


.st 
Five seconds sir...4...3...2...1... 


.hu 
Where's Nurse Chappedlips?! 


(WE SUDDENLY HEAR A FLUSHING SOUND FOLLOWED BY A TREMENDOUS 
CRASH.  BLACK OUT.)
