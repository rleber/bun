.aa ANNOUNCER   
Yes, a lot of people still have fond memories of last year's
FASS show. And up until now, these people treasured what small  
scraps of dialogue and occasional humour they could recall, 
full knowing that the ravages of time would some day cause them to forget   
these and other fond Remembrances of Things Past. But not any more! 
Now K-Sell, in conjunction with Marcel Proust Associates, brings you
the greatest household wonder since the iceman! 
   Yes, it's the new "Tanks for the Memory". "Tanks for the Memory",
the fantastic new device that revolutionizes your recollections! - with 
no muss, no fuss. Here's how it works.  
   K-Sell has brought together all the bloopers, blown lines, ad libs   
and obscene asides from all of the FASS shows ever presented,   

INCLUDING THE CELEBRATED TALE OF THE NYMPHOMANIAC AND THE BROKEN
DRIPOLATOR! Simply place the custom fitting, reversible,
contoured auditory receptacles on your ears,
and instantly the sights and
sounds of 15 years of questionable humour come rushing back to you. 
Yes, relive the agony and the ecstasy of such famous lines as:  
"Props!" ... and of course: "Kentucky Fried Christians!" ... who could  
forget: "He was trying to get it off in the Duke's Office." 
... and everyone's favourite: "Is that your nose or did your
pants fall down?" Isn't that amazing!   
   Yes, "Tanks for the Memory", the spectacular new commode 
from K-Sell. And, as a special introductory bonus get   
"Abbatoir Magician", the miracle device that slices, dices, 
drops lint on your cat and recites the complete collection of all   
non-slanderous jokes ever published in Enginews!
   Remember, that's "Tanks for the Memory" and "Abbatoir Magician", 
both from K-Sell, only $29.98 - $29.30 in Newfoundland. 
   Available wherever good head is sold.
