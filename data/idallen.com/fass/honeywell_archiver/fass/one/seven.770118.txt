.aa CR1 
This coffee tastes like mud.


.aa CR2 
It should. It was ground this morning.  


.aa CR3 
I think I got a rubber pie. 


.aa CR1 
God's will, sister; God's will. Say has anybody seen my hotdog? 


.aa CR2 
I found it! It's over here with my tangburger. Spreading
the mustard, you might say. 


.aa CR1 
I don't relish the thought. 


.aa CR3 
Every time I see the prices on that menu I feel sick.   


.aa CR4 
I know what you mean. I used to get the same feeling every time 
I saw the SELECTIONS on the menu. But not any more:

I used to have a stomach, but it isn't here today:  
They took out my digestive tract and threw it all away. 
I now frequent Food Services, I eat here all the time.  
My plastic gut will save me, but the prices are a crime.

(ENTER TOLSTOY, PRIZE (ON HIS ARM) AND PRIDE)   


.pz 
So this is the cafeteria?   


.to 
Actually, it's not a cafeteria, it's a mess.


.pd 
That's pretty obvious.  


.to 
I suggest you take a look at our menu.  


(THEY DO)   


Some people are a little put off by it, but most are thoroughly 
disgusted.  


.pd 
It's horrible! Is Tang the only thing they serve here?  


(BURP FROM ONE OF THE CREW) 


.to 
I'm afraid so. That's all the Pederasty ever supplies its   
vessels with. Oh, very occasionally we get something special,   
like fried tribbles, but basically it's nothing but 
Tang, Tang, Tang-

.aa COOKIE  
Shaddup!!!  


(THEY COMPLY)   


I should apologize, like, tuh youse ladies. Duh boys are always 
a little rowdy, like, before duh bar opens. 


.pz 
You have a bar? (TO TOLSTOY) And I thought you said that there  
was just Tang on board. 


.aa COOKIE  
Akshully dat's correct, like. But what we do is doctor it up
wit' anyting in duh engine room we can find dat changes 
duh taste. Since Commander Spot is responsible for all chemicals    
in duh engine room we figgered dat it'd be best tuh consider
it alcoholic until proved guilty.   


(COOKIE LAUGHS. ALL OTHERS ARE SILENT)  


Pretty funny, eh? "Alcoholic until proved guilty." (LAUGHS  
AND POKES TOLSTOY IN THE ARM)   
Yeah, we got some pretty successful drinks, like.   


.pd 
What kind of drinks do youse - er - you have?   


.aa COOKIE  
Well, we sell a lot of Singapore Tangs, and dry Martangies are  
pretty popular, but duh out and out favourite is duh Harvey 
Walltanger. But enuff of dis. Would yuz like tuh order, like?   


.to 
What's your soup like ? 


.aa COOKIE  
.nf 
.in+5   
If you look into your soup today,   
You're in for a big surprize.   
But trying to eat any soup today,   
That wouldn't be very wise. 
'Cause fifteen men have ate it today
And fifteen men were carried away,  
From watching that group
I'd guess that the soup's   
Infected.

.fi 


.to 
Forget the soup. What's today's special?


.aa COOKIE  
Breaded Tang Cutlets, same as yesterday, and duh day before, and
duh day before dat- 


.to 
Still the same?! Cookie, you've had that same special for the last three
months without any change!  


.aa COOKIE  
Can I help it if dere was a lot o' leftovers? Anyway, it's just 
about gone and I've got a new recipe dat I'm achin' to try on   
yuz tomorrow.   


.to 
What?   


.aa COOKIE  
Sumptin' called Montezuma's Revenge. I tink it's a Mexican dish.


.to 
Give me a double helping today, Cookie. I don't think I'll be   
very hungry tomorrow.   


.pz 
I think I should get some more too. It's going to be a long trip.   



.pd 
Here, take mine. I've lost my appetite. 


(THEY SIT DOWN) 


I don't see how you can stand food like this. And at these prices!  


.to 
I'm afraid it's out of our hands. One of the top men at Star
Flit Command personally supervizses the Star Flit dietary   
corps. General - uh -   


.pz 
General Foods?  


.to 
That's it! How did you know?


.pz 
Gut instinct.   


.to 
Anyway, the way I understand it,
all of the Pederasty ships used to have delicious food  
at extremely low prices. Unfortunately, this meant that they
were operating at a loss.   


.pd 
So they decided to cut down on their losses...? 


.to 
...by cutting down on consumption. The absence of washrooms on the  
ships might have had something to do with it as well.   
Well, they figured that the two easiest ways to cut down consumption
were to raise prices and lower quality. 


.pd 
And which did they do?  


.to 
Oh, they did both.  


.pd 
And they started making a profit on their meals?


.to 
No. They cut down on consumption so much that they increased
their losses.   


.pd 
Wouldn't it have been better if they had only done  
one?


.to 
Well, they couldn't. You see, altering both the quality and 
price involved some vast changes in policy -


.pd 
Yes?


.to 
And they were afraid that if they only went through with half the   
alterations they would be attacked for making   
another half-vast policy change.


(PRIZE MOANS)   


What's wrong? Russian humour too much for you?  


.pz 
I think something I ate didn't agree with me.   


.to 
I'd better notify the Kyeptin.  
He'll probably want to take you... down to Sickbay, that is.
(INTO INTERCOM) Kyeptin, Kyeptin, the Prize is ill; I think she had 
too many cutlets ... yes, a cutlet above the rest ... no, the Pride 
is all right. Why? ...  
Kyeptin, I don't think you can catch that sort of thing from
rotten food-


.aa COOKIE  
Rotten food?! I slave in dis kitchen 0.36 hours a stardate and  
some lousy Ensign has the nerve to insult my Tang! Why, 
my Tang is duh best Tang (**) you'll find on any vessel 
from here to Andromeda...
