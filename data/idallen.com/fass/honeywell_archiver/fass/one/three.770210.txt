Act 1, Scene 3 - Intro  


(BLACK STAGE. SHIP MODEL SWINGING ON A STRING ILLUMINATED BY A SPOT.
STAR TREK THEME BEGINS) 


.je 
Farce: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship
Satirize; its five year mission (four year honours, three year general) 
to explore strange new subjects,to seek out night life and new  
libations, to blindly go where no man has gone before.  


(LIGHTS UP ON JERK IN CAPTAIN'S CHAIR CHISELLING ON LOG AND 
DODGING THE SHIP AS IT SWINGS ON THE STRING)


.je 
Captain's log, stardate...uh... today. The IUD Satirize has 
been granted a great honour: to escort their serene cleavages,  
the Prize and the Pride of the planet Booby, to a meeting of
OSPEC, the Organization of Silicon Producing and Exporting  
Civilizations. It is imperative that we win the Boobies'
support, for without their vast reserves of silicon the 
Galactic Pederasty will quickly deplete its existing supplies   
of silicon-based fuels. (CALLS OFFSTAGE) File this, Yeoman, 
and don't let Spotty get his hands on it; last week he  
burned a month's worth of records in his blasted engines.   
Oh, and get me another chisel - I think this one's running  
out.


(LIGHTS DOWN ON JERK AND UP ON BOOBIES AND EXPENDABLE CREW  
MEMBER) 


.aa ECM 
Come along, your ladyships, the Satirize is ready to go 
as soon as you're abroad - I mean aboard. We've gone to no  
expense to make this a very memorable trip, your Ladyships. 


.pz 
I'll enjoy the trip  much more if you'll stop saying "your  
Ladyships". Call me the Prize Booby, as all my loyal subjects do.   


.pd 
Yes, and you can call me the Pride Booby.   


.pz 
Hush up, Pride. You're boring when you gush so. 


.pd 
When I gush?! Look at Old Faithful spouting off.


.pz 
Now look here, you bi-  


.aa ECM 
Ladies, please! Don't fight. There's no need for it. Now
kiss and make up. (THEY HESITATE) After all, how do you think   
this looks to your loyal subjects and admirers? 


(PRIZE AND PRIDE EMBRACE)   


Isn't that nice: Prize and Pride together again!


.pd 
Are you sure this trip is necessary?


.pz 
Necessary? It's vital! These people need our silicon to keep their  
spacecraft going and we need their money to keep our planet going.  
No one knows the size of our reserves, so we've got to play our cards   
close to our chests. Think of what we can do for our planet with
the money we make: modernize industry, keep abreast of the latest   
advances. Thank God for the energy crisis!  


.pd 
You realize that some of their planets think that the OSPEC planets 
made up this crisis so that we could inflate our profits?   


.pz 
Bullcookies! How could small planets like ours create such a shortage?  
The planet Booby stands Humble, its Standard waving across the  
Gulf of space. Our Shell of a planet lies open to its Mobil 
enemies, eager as Beavers to Gain our resources. Lies   
I say! This falsehood shall be exposed! We shall be Exxonerated!
Let our silicon provide a Starburst of Bonuses for our planet.  


.pd 
By gosh, the Prize is right! Oil bet we make a million. I'm 
glad I'm part of this Big Red Team. 


.aa ECM 
If you ladies are quite ready, we had breast - uhh -
bust - uhh - BEST be on our way.
