Act 1, Scene 5 - IPP


.jo 
(AT CONSOLE) Captain, Lt. Spot requests permission to be beamed 
on board.   


.je 
All right, Jock, beam him aboard.   
Lieutenant Suru, what's our speed and approximate   
ETA.


.su 
We're travelling at Wat eight, Captain, and should  
reach the refuelling station in about one hour. 


(GROANS FROM THE CREW.  ALL CROSS LEGS.)


.je 
I don't think we can hold it much longer, Suru! 


(ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FROM CREW) 


Better increase speed   
to Wat Ten.  (TO TOLSTOY)  Are you sure about this  
place, Ensign?  


.to 
Oh It says right here on the map, Captain.  Hershey's   
Bar and Grill - "good and plenty food" - "eat more  
and pay less" - "appearing this week in our Mars
Bar - Sweet Marie and The O'Henries" - here it is   
- "clean restrooms".


(CHEERS FROM THE CREW)  


.je 
That's fine, Pavlov.


.to 
That's Tolstoy, sir.


.je 
Whatever -  


.pd 
Why are you all so impatient to get to this 
place?  


.je 
Well, you may find this hard to believe, but you see, when they 
designed this ship they neglected to include
facilities. 


.pz 
Facilities? 


.je 
They forgot to plan a head. 


.pd 
Head?   


.je 
(GETTING EMBARASSED (YOU'D THINK HE WOULD)) You know, a can; a john.


.pz 
Can?


.pd 
John?   


.je 
There's no reading room on this ship!   


.aa PRIZE~&~PRIDE~(TOGETHER~AGAIN)  
OOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHH!! 


.je 
We've been out in space for 4 months, so you can understand our 
consternation.  


.aa PRIZE~&~PRIDE   
(CONFUSED) Oh - ?   


.st 
(AS HE ENTERS BRIDGE)  Captain, Commander Spot reporting
for duty.   


.je 
I didn't know we were subject to an excise tax.  Anyway,
I would like a full report on your mission to Canis 
Majoris in duplicate.   


.st 
Canis Majoris, Canis Majoris, I thought I thought it was
it was Cannabis Majoris, Cannabis Majoris.  


.je 
Spot, what are you doing?   


.st 
Dictating my report in duplicate, sir.  


.je 
Computer, are you recording this garbage?   


.aa COMPUTER~VOICE~(OFFSTAGE)   
Yes sir, Yes sir.   


.je 
Erase Spot's report, computer, and record it in 
singlicate only.


.aa COMPUTER~VOICE  
Singlicate? 


.je 
Spot, proceed to report.


.st 
Well, sir - it was very rough on Canis Majoris. 
It's a dog-eat-dog world down there.


.to 
Spot, you're never satisfied - all you ever do is   
bitch, bitch, bitch!


.st 
So do the men on Canis Majoris.  Now quit hounding  
me. 


.je 
Did you manage to procure the supplies? 


.st 
But procuring's illegal.


.je 
Spotty - did you get our supplies or not?   


.st 
Yes, sir!  I even got some extra stuff. 


.je 
Extra stuff - I'm afraid to ask!  What did you get? 


.st 
Fresh seafood.  


.su 
Crabs again.


.aa YEOMAN~RANDY
(ASIDE TO SPOTTY) Did you get our, uh, stuff?   


.st 
Stuff?  What - ooooh, stuff.  Oh, yeah - I got it.  


.je 
What are you two whispering about?  


.aa YEOMAN~RANDY
Oh, nothing, nothing.   


.je 
Spot!  Did you buy more Dilithium crystals o

Spot!  Did you buy more Dilithium crystals on Canis Majoris?


.st 
Well - uh-  


.je 
Spotty, why do you do it?   


.st 
I snort 'em cause I like 'em, and I'd rather fight than 
twitch.  I mean, Dilithium feels good like a    
hallucinogen should!


.je 
That's poor English.


.st 
What do you want, good grammar or good taste?  Me and   
my dilithium got a real good thing - two good things    
in fact.  I'd walk a mile for a sample. 
Remember - you can snort when you're out of the country, but... 


(DING!) 


(SPOT SHRUGS, STAYS SILENT) 


.to 
Kyeptin, Kyeptin, I've picked up a UFO on my sensors!   


.je 
Who FO? 


.to 
UFO.


.hu 
UFO yourself, Tolstoy - have some respect for the Captain!  


.su 
UFO! Don't talk like that to my buddy!  


.st 
UFO! That's no way to speak to a lady!  


.jo 
Why don't you all FO.   


(SILENCE)   


.to 
Kyeptin, I believe that there's a cruiser following us. 


.je 
Cabin?  


.to 
No; cop.

.to 
Should I calculate a course of evasion, Captain?


.je 
(SIGH) No, we might as well pull over and see what he wants.
Maybe he's selling policeman's ball tickets.


.jo 
Illogical, Captain. The IPP don't have balls, or conventions.   


.je 
Lt. Suru, convert to sub-light velocity.


.su 
I'm an atheist, Captain.


.je 
("WHY ME" EXPRESSION) Slow it down, Suru.   


.hu 
Transporter room informs us that we have just been boarded by   
an IPP officer. 


(ENTER THE PIG) 


.aa OK  
All right, boy, y'all just hold it, right thar. Ah'm Officer Knightly   
o' the I.P.P. - that's Inter-Planetary PO-lice -

fer doin' Wat Ten in a Watfiv zone. Yessiree, Ah'm a-gonna give 
them whatfor!   


.jo 
It is illogical to assume that we were travelling at Wat Ten; we
were flying on Algol engines.   


.aa OK  
Moonshiners, huh?(NOT "eh", eh?)  Well, this is a raid! 


.aa CREW
Raid!!!

Judge Lynchem will take care o' them real nice, like. Anythin' else,
good buddy? 


.aa OK  
Negatory, Rubber Duck, this is Red Rider, over and out. 
(TO JERK) Well now, boy, let me see yer blue slip.  


.je 
Sorry, Officer, I don't wear dresses.   


.aa OK  
Aren't you the funny one? Let's see yer swindle sheet   
while yer at it.


.je 
What ARE you talking about? I'm Captain James T. Jerk of the starship   
Satirize, its five-year -

.nf 
.in+5   
  Captain, I am overjoyed to meet you face to face, 
  We've been hearing quite a lot    
  About you 'round the place.   
  Closing papers, holding great debates,
  And now I understand you're God,  
  I wonder how he rates.......  
     So you are the Jerk, you're the great Captain Jerk,
     Prove to me that you're divine,
     Close the Chevron one more time,   Uh,      If 

     If you do that for me, then I'll let you go free,  
     Come on Jerk of the Peds.  


  Captain you just won't believe    
  The hit you've made 'round here,  
  You are all we talk about, the wonder of the year,
  Oh, what a pity, if it's all a lie,   
  Still I'm sure that you can rock  
  The Chevrics if you try........   
     So you are the Jerk, you're the great Captain Jerk,
     Show me that you're for our cause, 
     Go ignore some more by-laws,   
     If you can do that, then we'll know where it's at, 
     Come on Jerk of the Peds.  


     They - tell - me - you are the Jerk,   
     You're the great Captain Jerk, 
     Prove to us you're still our boy,  
     Even when you're unemploy---ed,
     I won't have it said that the Fedhead is dead, 
     Come on Jerk of the..... come on Jerk of the.....  
     Come on Jerk of the Peds.

hell of a ripped-up ticket!
