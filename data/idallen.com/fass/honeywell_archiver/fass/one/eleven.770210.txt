Act I, Scene 11 - Finding the farmhouse.


(ON THE BRIDGE.)


.je 
(ENTERING) All right, Mr.Jock, what have we got?


.jo 
We have picked up a small object floating directly ahead
of us sir, near that small planet.  


.je 
What is the name of the planet, Jock?   


.jo 
Oh, it's just some uncharted planet.

.je 
None of that, Ensign; analysis of the object Mr.Jock.   


.jo 
It would appear to be made almost entirely out of wood. 


.je 
Wood?   


.jo 
Yes, Captain.   


.to 
Keptain, we are getting wisual contact with the object. 


.je 
Put it on the screen, Mr.Pushkin.   


.to 
That's Tolstoy. 


.je 
Whatever.   


.to 
Wisual on,sir.  


.je 
I can't see anything.  Malfunction of the viewing screen?   


.jo 
Frugality on the part of the props people, more  likely.


.je 
Tell me what you see when it comes up, Ensign.  


.to 
Keptain, Keptain, I can see it now.  It looks like....  
it looks like..... it looks like a farmhouse.   


.je 
A farm house?   


.to 
Yes, and it has a sign out front. It says ...  "Crad House".


.je 
Are you sure it's a "C"?


.to 
It's a long way off, Keptain.   


.jo 
Picking up lifeform readings, Captain.  


.je 
Identify.   


.jo 
Two lifeforms.  One a humanoid female, approximately ten
years old, the other a dog of some sort.


.je 
Spotty, get down to the transporter room and bring  
them aboard.  I want them up on the bridge to answer some   
questions.  


.st 
Aye, Captain. (EXITS)   


.jo 
Typical earth type house of the twentieth century, Midwest  
United States I would guess.


.je 
Well, we'll soon know who we're dealing with.  Mr.Suru  
lock onto the house with our Massey-Ferguson Tractor beam.  


.su 
Aye, sir.

THE BRIDGE, LOOKING AT ALL THE FLASHING LIGHTS, AND ALL THE 
PEOPLE IN VARIOUS POSITIONS.  ARE YOU READY FOR THE IMMORTAL LINE?) 


.ty 
Somehow, I don't think we're in Kansas anymore, Dodo.   


(SHE LOOKS AT MR.JOCK WHO LOOKS BACK AT HER WITH ONE EYEBROW LIFTED.)   


.je 
No, my dear, you are on the bridge of the starship Satirize,
its five-year mission (four years honours, three year general)....  


.jo 
Captain...........  


.je 
Sorry.  I am James T. Jerk. 


.ty 
What does the T. stand for? 


.je 
"The".  


.ty 
I'm Torothy, and this is my dog Dodo.   


.to 
Oh, Dodo, the dog from outer space. 


.ty 
We're not from outer space.  We're from Kansas. 


.jo 
Much the same thing.


.je 
What are you doing out here then?  How did your house come to   
be floating around this planet? 


.ty 
(SNIFFLES) It's a long sad story, Captain Jerk, 
and I don't think that I should bother you with it. 


.je 
Well, all right then... 


.ty 
It's not as if it's a dull story, in fact some may think that   

it was interesting, but it's just too painful to trot out my
tale of woe and deprivation and the evil that led me into this  
situation.  


.je 
Fine.  Mr. Jock, prepare to leave orbit and set...  


.ty 
All right, I'll tell you the whole sordid mess. But don't blame 
me if you shed more than one tear over my story.


(JERK SIGHS. JOCK LOOKS AT THE CEILING . TOLSTOY PULLS OUT A
PAD AND PENCIL.)


.ty 
My Uncle Ben owned a rice farm in the wilds of Kansas.  


.st 
Rice in Kansas? 


.ty 
It had been a wheat farm, but he converted it to rice.  


.je 
I shudder to think what he called it.   


.ty 
He called it MacRonald's Farm.  That was his name, Ben MacRonald.   


(A COLLECTIVE SIGH OF RELIEF FROM THE BRIDGE CREW AND THE CRITICS.) 


Anyway, we made a good living off   
the rice, until one day, Uncle Ben was approached by an indidious   
organization who were buying up all of Kansas to make it into an
airport: Clarabelle or something like that. 


.je 
And?


.ty 
Well, of course, Uncle Ben wouldn't think of selling.  I mean,  
it had taken him thirty years to get the land clear,
get his rocks off and so forth. 
So he kicked the people off 
the property.   


.st 
Just what he should have done - a man's home is his castle and  
he should protect what he's got.


.ty 
That's what Uncle Ben said.  Anyway, these men kept on coming   
back over and over again, trying to cow Uncle Ben into selling  
out to Clarabelle.  They began to sneak into the back forty 
at night with signs saying, "All hail the glorious site 
of the new people's Airport and Centre of Progressive   
Aviatory Thought."  


.je 
Who were these men anyway?  


.ty 
They said they belonged to the Alabaman Industrial Association  
of Insidious Aviators.  


.je 
The AIAIA.  


.jo 
So it would seem, Captain.  


.ty 
It got so that we couldn't go out into the fields on a Friday   
without seeing signs
like "Victory to the Alabaman People",  
"Let them eat   
Airplanes."  "Workers of the world unite - you have nothing 
to lose but these paddies." 


.st 
Paddies? With a name like MacRonald, I would have thought you were  
Scottish.   


.ty 
Every week it was the same thing.  We tried to complain to the  
sheriff, said that after all it was our land, and we should 
be allowed to do what we wanted with it.
But the sherriff said that he wouldn't  
stifle the freedom of the press 
and if they wanted to press us, there was nothing he would do.  


.jo 
It sounds as if the sherriff was acting illogically.


.ty 
We sort of knew that he wasn't on our side when he called   
us Bourgeois Pigs - and he had been eating Chile.   


.jo 
Indeed. 


.ty 
Well.  The signs kept up for well over a year, and  
they just got nastier and nastier.  
I mean, I've never even known   
a cocker spaniel.   
One day, Uncle Ben decided that 
he had just had enough.  He went over to the gate,  
the one that the AIAIA used to drive their trucks   
through when they were briging in the signs,
and he just locked those nasty AIAIA people right out   
of the farm, just locked them right out.


.je 
What happened?  


.ty 
Well, they drove around the gate of course. The fence hasn't
been up over there for years.  It was a matter of principle.
The only
thing that really happened was that the AIAIA got really mad
and decided to take some positive action.  Well, before you 
knew it they had gone back to Alabama   
to get their airplanes and helicopters and they were over top   
of the farm, buzzing the cattle and frightening the rice and    
causing a real havoc.   


.je 
It must have been pretty bad.   


.ty 
The noise wasn't so bad, although that 747 made a bit of a  
roar, but it was the wind that they stirred up.  Boy those  
AIAIA people were a real bunch of wind-bags.


.jo 
I can imagine.  


.ty 
Well, the wind just kept building and building. 
Uncle Ben and Aunt Jemima went out to try   
to straighten things around, maybe shoot a few wingtips off,
friendly-like, but firm, but they were blown away.  
Wasn't long before they had a regular   
twister rolling, and the house lifted up right off its  
footings, shook its booties a little, and was off into the  
sky.  We must have flew clear over the rainbow...somewhere...   
somewhere over the...   


.je 
A very very sad story my dear, and it seems as if you have  
a song to sing for us?  


.ty 
If you insist.  


.je 
Not particularly.   


.ty 
Since you press me.

(ASIDE)  It should just teach the old goat for being a wealthy  
Bourgeois burgher.  Cheez.  (HE TAKES A BITE OF HIS APPLE.) 


.je 
What was that MacIntosh? And what are you doing on the bridge   
- you should be looking after a sick Booby. 


.mc 
Yessir.  I just came up when I hear that something unusual had  
been found.  I thought that you might have need of me.  


.je 
No, doctor, no emergency.  Return to your duties.   


.mc 
Yes, Sir.  (ASIDE)  This is the opportunity that I've been waiting  
for.  I'll simply sneak into the transporter room and we'll 
beam down to the planet's surface.  I'm homefree.   
(HE EXITS)  


.jo 
(LOOKING AFTER HIM)  Captain, there is something that disturbs me   
about the Doctor's behaviour.   


.je 
What is it? 


.jo 
I can't quite put my finger on it.  


(HIS FINGER IS PERILOUSLY   
CLOSE TO HUARU'S BREATS AS HE STABS IN THE AIR.  SHE IS LOOKING 
SHOCKED.)   


.je 
Well?   


.jo 
I believe that it might be wise for me to follow him
and see what he is up to.  It is altogether too easy to 
impersonate one of the members of this crew.


.je 
All right, Mr. Jock, do that.  Mr. Solzhenitsyn, take over for  
Mr. Jock.   


.to 
That's Tolstoy. 


.jo 
No, it's Jock.  


.to 
.ul 
MY  
name is Tolstoy!


.je 
You could change it to Smith and save us all a lot of trouble.  


.to 
Smith!? 


.je 
Smithski?  Hmm.  Maybe it would be better if we stayed in orbit 
around this planet until we get to the bottom of this mess  
about the farmhouse and Macintosh.  Prepare for course change,  
Mr. Suru.   


.su 
I'm sorry sir. First, you'll  have to get your faculty advisor's
signature, as well as the initials of the professor involved and
his wife and his dog, and the milkman, the butcher, the baker   
the whip-maker, Burt Matthews' tailor ....

THE LIGHTS PEOPLE MANAGE TO BLACK OUT THE STAGE.)
