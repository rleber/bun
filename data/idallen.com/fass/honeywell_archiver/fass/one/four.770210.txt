Act 1, Scene 4 - The Bridge 


(LIGHTS UP ON BRIDGE: JERK IN HIS CHAIR, MCINTOSH STANDING BESIDE HIM,  
HUARYU AT HER CONSOLE, JOCK AT HIS, SURU ON HIS 'MOTORCYCLE'
CONSOLE WITH TOLSTOY IN THE 'SIDECAR')  


.aa ECM 
Ahem. (NO ONE NOTICES)  


.hu 
Ready to leave orbit, Captain Jerk. 


.je 
Thank you, Lt. Huaryu.  


.hu 
(LOOKS PUZZLED) I'm Lt. Huaryu, Captain.


.je 
I should think you'd know who I was after all   
we've been through together, Huaryu!


.hu 
You know who I am, and let's not broadcast all over subspace
what we've been through.


.jo 
(CHANGING THE SUBJECT) Course calculated... 


.to 
....and pre-registered, Kyeptin.


.aa ECM 
(HAS BEEN CLEARING HIS THROAT WITH INCREASING VIGOUR THROUGHOUT 
THIS DISCOURSE) Ahem, ahem! 


.je 
Wha..? Say, that's a nasty cough you've got there. Doctor   
Macintosh, give him something for his cough.


.mc 
Sure thing, Jim. Here's a quarter.  


.hu 
That's not much.


.mc 
It's not much of a cough. (HE LAUGHS, CREW IS STONE SILENT: HE STIFLES) 


.je 
All right, people, that's enough. Cut it out!   


.to 
Thyet's Dr. Macintosh's job, Kyeptin. (HE LAUGHS,IBID. )


.je 
Hold it right there, Ensign! (HAND OVER EYES) Oh,no!    


.to 
And now I'll hold it over here! 


(GENERAL LAUGHTER)  


.je 
(TO ECM) By the way, who are you?   


.hu 
Yes, Captain?   


.je 
No, no, no, not you. (JUMPS UP AND DOWN, POINTING TO ECM)   
Him, him, hymn! 


.su 
How about "Onward Christian Soldiers"?  
.to 
Oh boy, charades! Sounds like... joint. 


.je 
Aaaaaaaaaarrrrrrgh! 


.jo 
Joint - scream - it's obvious: a joint gets you high and
a scream is a high-pitched vocalism of little or no meaning.
Obviously he's trying to tell us that he's stoned and   
doesn't know what he's saying. Really Captain, I'm ashamed; 
a man in your position! 


(JERK, ANGUISHED TO THE POINT OF BEING ON HIS KNEES AND HOLDING 
HIS FACE, SUDDENLY LEAPS UP, GRABS ECM BY THE THROAT AND SHAKES 
HIM)


.je 
What - is - your - name? Why - are - you - here? What - is -    
this - all - about? 


.aa ECM 
(ON HIS KNEES, CHOKING) It's (GASP) Howdy Booby time!   


(JERK RELEASES ECM, WHO COLLAPSES IN A HEAP)


.je 
What? Oh, my God, they're here; and this place is a mess! Quick,    
Suru, set phasers on dust.  Prize and Pride ... together-   


.pd 
Skip it, Captain, we've been through that once. 


.je 
Your Boobyships, please.  Welcome aboard.  Let me introduce you 
to my crew. 


(AS JERK INTRODUCES EVERYBODY, MCINTOSH MOVES   
FROM BESIDE THE CAPTAIN'S CHAIR,  EXAMINES ECM BRIEFLY  
AND REMAINS THERE STANDING.)


.je 
This is Lt. Huaru, our communications officer.  


.pz 
How are you?


.hu 
No, Huaru.  


.pz 
I'm the Prize Booby.


.hu 
So's the Captain.   


.pd 
I thought he was Jerk.  


.hu 
That too.  Who are you? 


.pd 
I'm the Pride booby, her sister.


.hu 
I'm Lt. Huaru.  How are you?


.pz 
What an odd name.   


.hu 
What?   


.pz 
No, Huaru.  


(HUARU ATTEMPTS TO ANSWER, BUT THE CAPTAIN CUTS HER OFF.)    Wha



.je 
Ah, this is our co-op Science officer, Mr. Jock.


.pz 
Didn't you write a book on babies?  


.jo 
No, madam, that would be illogical. 


.pz 
Why?  Because you're a science officer? 


.jo 
No, because babies tend to get the printing presses messy.  


.pz 
What about when they're older?  


.jo 
That is a pressing question.


.je 
And this is Lt. Suru, out pilot and weapons officer.


.pd 
How do you do?  


.su 
What?   


.pd 
Pardon? 


.su 
I say, "You're pardoned."   


.pz 
Why?


.su 
She asked me.   


.pd 
What?   


.su 
How I did; I mean, how I pardoned.  


.pz 
Are they all like this? 


.je 
No, some of them are a little silly.


.pd 
Oh God. 


.je 
This is Ensign Doestoyevski, our navigator. 


.to 
That's Tolstoy, and "nawigator".


.je 
Sorry, Ensign Nawigator.


.pz 
I say; you're Russian, aren't you?  


.to 
Yes, why?   


.pz 
No reason really, it's just been so long since I saw a red ensign flying.   APTASee you later, nawigator

See you later, nawigator.   


(SCUFFLE IN BACKGROUND AS BRASSIERE SNEAKS IN THE DOORWAY,  
GARROTES MACINTOSH AND STUFFS HIM INTO THE HATCH MARKED "TANG   
CONVERTER".)


.je 
(TURNING AROUND AFTER THIS IS DONE) Oh yes; this is our medical officer, Dr.
McIntosh of the Star Flit medical corpse.  Affectionately known as  
"the Bones".


.rb 
Aaaaaayyyyyy.   


.je 
Our engineering officer, Mr. Spot, is not here right now.  We'll be 
picking him up later.  And I, of course, am Captain Jerk, at your   
service.


.pz 
Thank you, Captain Jerk-at-your-service; but ...


.je 
That's Jerk.


.pz 
Pardon? 


.je 
It's not Jerk-at-your service, just 
Jerk.   


.pd 
Well, if you say so; we'll just jerk if we need anything.   


.je 
No, no. If you need anything, just call your orderly.   


.pz 
I thought you said to jerk. 


.je 
No, I'm Jerk.   


.pd 
We figured that out for ourselves.  


.pz 
Captain, I think you had better see to our escort. I think you killed him.  


.aa ECM 
I'm not dead.   


.pd 
Don't argue.  She's a goddess, and she says you're dead.


.aa ECM 
I'm getting better. 


.rb 
I've examined him and he's dead.


.aa ECM 
I'm not.


.rb 
(SPREADS HIS HANDS AND LOOKS AROUND, A LA FONZARELLI) Aaayy.
(STOMPS ECM ONCE.) He's dead, Captain.  


.je 
Well, do something about him.  We can't have him messing up the floor.  


(BRASSIERRE STUFFS ECM INTO THE TANG CHUTE WITH MCINTOSH.)  


.aa ECM 
I'm not deeeeaaaaad. (DIES AWAY)


.je 
Well, let's get going   
(JERK MOVES TO CHAIR WITH A BOOBY ON EITHER SIDE OF 
HIM.) What's our course?


.to 
Right on, Captain.  


.je 
What's that, Ibsen? 


.to 
Straight ahead, sir; and that's Tolstoy, sir.   


.je 
Whatever, and change that to a right turn.  


.jo 
Correction, Captain.  That will be six wrongs, Ensign.  


.je 
Huh? How do you get that?   


.jo 
It's simple, sir.  If two wrongs don't make a right, then   
they make a left.  If three lefts equals one right, then it is  
intuitively obvious that
by applying the Forrest lemma on capitalistic letters   t arsix wrongs make a right. Completely logi

six wrongs make a right. Completely logical, sir.   


.je 
Jock, why don't you go sharpen your ears?   


.jo 
Sorry sir, the ear-sharpener is broken. 


.je 
I don't think I can take this any more.  This crew is getting on my 
nerves.  I wish I could drop tham off on the nearest planet and carry   
on by myself.  There's only one problem.


(WALKS TO THE FRONT OF THE STAGE.)

I don't know how to fly this,   
How it works, how to move it.   
It's a ship, it's just a ship.  
And I've had so many ships before   
In very many ways, it's just one more.  


Should I keep on course,
Should I just drop out, 
Think I'll ask Dick Knight what it's all about. 
I never thought I'd get this far;   
What do I do now?   


I don't know how to fly this,   
What the heck, it won't matter  
I've got a crew, a not bad crew 
And they all know how; who told them?   
Maybe thay'll tell me; I hope they do.  
I hope they do

.to 
Excuse me, Keptain. I wish to report that I can't make that 
course change, sir. 


.je 
Why not?


.to 
You didn't get the form signed by the Assistant Assistant Auxiliary 
Undersecretary to the Dean's Second-in-Command's Subordinate.   


.je 
By the who?  Never mind.  Straight ahead.   


.su 
Vroom, vroom.   


.je 
Quiet, Suru.


.su 
Putputputputput ( LOOKS AROUND GRINNING ) Brrrrooooom, brrrroooooom,
brrrrroooooooom, putputputput.  


.je 
Cool it, Suru.  


.su 
Br-r-r-r-r-r-mmm, br-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-mmm. 


.je 
Stop it, Suru, or I'll break your scarf.


.su 
Yes, Captain, straight ahead sir.  ( A FEW SECONDS OF SILENCE.  
THEN IN ANGUISH.) Please don't break my scarf, sir! 


(HE STARTS TO CRY AS THE LIGHTS GO OUT.)
