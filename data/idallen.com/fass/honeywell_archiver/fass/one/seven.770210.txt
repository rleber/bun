This coffee tastes like mud.


.aa CR2 
It should. It was ground this morning.  


.aa CR3 
I think I got a rubber pie. 


.aa CR1 
God's will, sister; God's will. Say has anybody seen my hotdog? 


.aa CR2 
I found it! It's over here with my tangburger. Spreading
the mustard, you might say. 


.aa CR1 
I don't relish the thought. 


.aa CR3 
Every time I see the prices on that menu I feel sick.   


.aa CR4 
I know what you mean. I used to get the same feeling every time 
I saw the SELECTIONS on the menu. But not any more:

I used to have a stomach,   
But it isn't here today:
They took out my digestive tract
And threw it all away.  
I now frequent Food Services,   
I eat here all the time.
My plastic gut will save me,
But the prices are a crime.

.pz 
So this is the cafeteria?   


.to 
Actually, it's not a cafeteria, it's a mess.


.pd 
That's pretty obvious.  


.to 
I suggest you take a look at our menu.  


(THEY DO)   


Some people are a little put off by it, but most are thoroughly 
disgusted.  


.pd 
It's horrible! Is Tang the only thing they serve here?  


(COOKIE BURPS)  


.to 
I'm afraid so. That's all the Pederasty ever supplies its   
wessels with. Oh, very occasionally we get something special,   
like fried tribbles, but basically it's nothing but 
Tang, Tang, Tang-

If you look into your soup today,   
You're in for a big surprize.   
But trying to eat any soup today,   
That wouldn't be very wise. 
'Cause fifteen men have ate it today
And fifteen men were carried away,  
From watching that group
I'd guess that the soup's   
Infected.

.to 
Forget the soup. What's today's special?


.aa COOKIE  
Breaded Tang Cutlets, same as yesterday, and duh day before, and
duh day before dat- 


.to 
Still the same?! Cookie, you've had that same special for the last three
months without any change!  


.aa COOKIE  
Can I help it if dere was a lot o' leftovers?   
Anyway, I've got a new recipe dat I'm achin' to try on  
yuz tomorrow.   


.to 
What?   


.aa COOKIE  
Sumptin' called Montezuma's Revenge. I tink it's a Mexican dish.


.to 
Give me a double helping today, Cookie. I don't think I'll be   
very hungry tomorrow.   


.pz 
I think I should get some more too. It's going to be a long trip.   


.pd 
Here, take mine. I've lost my appetite. 


(THEY SIT DOWN)

I don't see how you can stand food like this. And at these prices!  


.to 
I'm afraid it's out of our hands.   
You see, increasing the quality and 
reducing the price involves some vast changes in policy -   


.pd 
Yes?


.to 
And they're afraid that if they only go through with half the   
alterations they'll be attacked for making  
another half-vast policy change.


(PRIZE MOANS)   


What's wrong? Russian humour too much for you?  


.pz 
I think something I ate didn't agree with me.   


.to 
I'd better notify the Kyeptin.  
He'll probably want to take you... down to Sickbay, that is.
(INTO INTERCOM) Kyeptin, Kyeptin, the Prize is ill; I think she had 
too many cutlets ... yes, a cutlet above the rest ... no, the Pride 
is all right. Why? ...  
Kyeptin, I don't think you can catch that sort of thing from
rotten food-


.aa COOKIE  
Rotten food?!   
Are you insulting my Tang? Why, 
my Tang is duh best Tang (**) you'll find on any vessel 
from here to Andromeda...
