Act 1, Scene 9 - Sickbay Scene  


.mc 
Tang, Tang, Tang!   
Is that all there is on this blasted ship?  
Is there no real food around here? (NOTICES GLASS)  
Say, a glass of apple juice, that's more in my line. Mmmmmm.


.cl 
(ENTERING)  
Oh, there you are doctor.   


.mc 
Yes, Nurse Chappedlips? 


.cl 
They're sending the Prize Booby up from the commisary;  
apparently something she ate didn't agree with her. 


.mc 
Sounds like the old Anita Bryant syndrome.  
After drinking too much Tang,   
everyone wants to take a powder.


.cl 
Of course doctor.   
Shall I get things in order for her?


.mc 
No that won't be necessary, 
carry on with whatever you were doing.  


.cl 
Yes, Doctor.
(TURNS TO LEAVE.)   
By the way, 
you haven't seen a urine sample around, have you?   
I was doing sone tests on one of the crewmen.   
No? Well, I'll keep looking.
Are you all right Doctor?   


.mc 
Yes, fine Nurse Chappedlips.
Carry on.   

(SHE LEAVES.)   


(MCINTOSH RUNS OFF STAGE.)  




(ENTER JERK,JOCK,PRIZE,PRIDE)   


.je 
All right Bones we're here. 
Bones? Bones?   


(RE-ENTER MCINTOSH, WIPING HIS MOUTH OFF WITH THE BACK OF HIS SLEEVE.)  


.mc 
Just getting rid of some excess weight Captain. 


.je 
Well, all right, but we've got a sick booby here.   
You'd better see what you can do with her - she's sagging already.  


.mc 
Indeed. Well, where does it hurt my dear?   


.jo 
May I remind the doctor that no matter what the emergency,  
Star Flit demands that the proper protocol be respected in  
all dealings with Sick Bay. 


.mc 
Of course Mr. Jock, a momentary slip on my part.
(ASIDE) 
Curses - I must watch my step.  
(ALOUD) 
All right then my dear, there's just a bit of business to take care of  
before we have a look at your boobyship.
(HE PRODUCES A BLUE SLIP)   
All right, could you please fill this out.  


.je 
Oh, she filled out long ago! (JERK DETECTS A FAUX PAS) Perhaps I should get back to the bridge, 
keep a look out for any likely-looking ... uhh ... uhh ... you know.


.jo 
A black hole would do in a pinch, sir; and you don't need to flush them.


.je 
I'll tell you when we're pinched, Mr. Jock. 
I trust that you will stay to help our visitor with anything she needs. 
Pride, would you like to accompany me to the bridge,
perhaps by way of my quarters.  


(SHE SMILES, TAKES HIS ARM. EXIT JERK,PRIDE)

Booooo-ballooooooooo!   


(SHE SMILES AT JOCK WHO FROWNS AND TURNS BACK TO THE QUESTIONAIRE)  


.jo 
Onto Arnez question.    


 .pz
Desi always talk in such an unclear fashion? Obscureness has its
place, but I love lucidity. 
(I'D JUST LIKE TO APOLOGIZE TO ALL CONCERNED FOR THAT LAST LINE.
IT WAS QUITE UNCALLED FOR AND IN VERY POOR TASTE, AND IF YOU
DON'T LIKE IT, LUMP IT!)


.pz 
Virgo.  


.jo 
You've never met the Captain before?


.pz 
Pardon? 


.jo 
Never mind. Dress size? 


.pz 
12. Mr Jock,  I really feel sick;   
couldn't we do this after the doctor examines me.   


.jo 
Sorry, but we have to do this by the book.  
We can't start bending the rules, no matter how important a guest you are.  
Profession? 


.pz 
Deity and inspiration to my people. 


.jo

.pz 
Hang-gliding, scuba diving, and collecting antique pizzas.

.jo 
Most memorable book?

.jo

Making it all the way to sick bay without losing any Tang.  


.jo 
Quote?  


.pz 
Which is going to be all over your floor in a minute
if you don't let the doctor do his thing; unquote.  


.jo 
Scotch? 


.pz 
No, Irish.  


.jo 
Well, that about wraps things up.   
Do you have an appointment with the doctor, 
or would you like to see the nurse? 


.pz 
I don't have an appointment,
and I don't need to see the nurse because the doctor is right there.


.cl 
Don't you want to see me? (SNIFF)   


.pz 
Why can't I see the Doctor? 


.cl 
Perhaps you need glasses.   
Poor dear, you should see a doctor. 


.pz 
That's what I'm here for.   


.cl 
Do you have an appointment? 


.pz 
He doesn't look busy right now. 
Can't I just see him now?   


.cl 
Snippish, isn't she?


.mc 
We'd better humour her. 
Set her up on the bed.  


.cl 
I'm sorry doctor, but the bed isn't working:
don't you remember? 
The Captain cornered Lieutenant Huaryu on one of them last week,
and blew out all the meters.
[A CONCESSION TO THE HARD-WORKING PROPS PEOPLE.]


.mc 
Oh yes, of course, of course, you'd think that I would remember 
something like that.
How could it slip my mind?  
Well, we'll have to do it the old way.  
Tell me, my dear how do you feel?   
(TRIES TO WRITE, SHAKES, WRITE, SHAKES, WRITES ETC) 


.pz 
Doctor, you're trying to write with a rectal thermometer!   


.mc 
(SHOCKED)   

What? Quick nurse, check the patient in bed 3!  


.cl 
(SHE CHECKS AND RETURNS)
Here's the pen Doctor, but I'm afraid you'll have to wait for the cap.  


.mc 
(NIBBLES ON PEN)
Now how do you feel?
(REALIZES PEN IS IN HIS MOUTH, REMOVES IT QUICKLY)  


.pz 
My stomach feels as if it's been run over with a tank.  


.mc 
That's Tang.


.jo 
Little difference in the long run.  


.mc 
Well, I suppose I should make an examination.   
Let's see, turn your head and cough.


.cl 
I don't think we use that test on women, Doctor.


.mc 
Just testing you all. Say "Ahhh".   


.aa EVERYONE ELSE   
Ahhh.   


.mc 
Very Interesting. Extreme ventriloquosis.   
Cross your legs.
(SHE DOES. SHE IS STILL STANDING. MCINTOSH LOOKS AT HER POSITION FOR A SECOND)  
Reminds me of the Captain.  
(HE PULLS OUT A RUBBER HAMMER AND TAPS ONE KNEE.)   
No response to the reflex test. 


.pz 
Is that bad?


.mc 
How should I know? Have you been drinking?  


.pz 
Only Tang.  


.mc 
And where does it hurt? 


.pz 
My stomach. 


.mc 
Hmmmm.  
Nurse come here for a moment.   


(THEY TURN THEIR BACKS ON THE BOOBY AND WHISPER FOR A FEW MOMENTS.  
WORDS LIKE "RUTABAGA", "WANKEL ROTARY ENGINE",  "SWISS ARMY KNIFE" AND "JOCKEY SHORTS"  
STAND OUT OVER THE GENERAL BUZZ.)   


Yes, my dear, we have decided that what is  
wrong with you is that you have a stomach ache. 


.pz 
Aha! And what are you going to do about it. 


.mc 
Oh, give you a needle I expect. 
The usual placebo, the opiate of the masses.
MLM triple-T.   


.pz 
What does that stand for?   


.mc 
Marxist-Leninist-Mao-Tse-Tung-in-Cheek-Thought. 
We tried crushing up Rolaids and injecting them,
but they clogged up the needle. 
And when we tried to inject Alka-Seltzer,   
people complained about the fizzing that went right up their arm
and occasionally blew off their shoulder.   
I remember good old Lefty Scaevola...   
We could give you an enema of the people, but that probably 
wouldn't be a wise move, what with no washrooms on this ship.   


(MACINTOSH AND CHAPPEDLIPS BOTH SHUDDER AND GIVE A LITTLE DANCE)


And this way we can vaccinate you at the same time against the epidemic.


.pz 
Epidemic!?  



.mc 
Nothing too serious. There's just been an outbreak of Shane flu on  
board these last few months.
So you'll be a lot happier with a shot of MLM triple-T. 


.pz 
If you insist.  


.mc 
Nurse Chappedlips, the needle please.   


.cl 
(PRODUCING A PUMP FLIT CAN) 
Here, Doctor.   


.mc 
All right, here you go now, you won't feel a thing  
if I remember how to do this right. 
There, nothing to it.

As serious as I can be, 
No trace of hilarity;

Immense popularity.

.fi 


All power to the pancreas!  


.mc 
There, that will wear off in a few minutes and she'll be right as rain. 
Better keep an eye on her though for a while, Mr. Jock, 
she might be tempted to start passing out gastro-intestinal tracts. 
We'll keep her here for a while.


.jo 
Fine, doctor, I shall proceed to the bridge and 
help the captain with his search.   
(EXIT JOCK) 

!?  

.mc 
Pointy-eared creep. 


.cl 
How can you say that Doctor when you know I'm stuck on him? 


.mc 
That's only because his Vulcan skin has the consistancy of flypaper.
Well, that's all Nurse Chappedlips, I'll look after the Prize myself.   
Why don't you go and do a lobotomy or something.


.cl 
Yes, Doctor.
(AS SHE GOES SHE LOOKS AT HIM STRANGELY. TO HERSELF SHE SAYS:)  
That's odd. He knows that we've done all the lobotomies 
that regulations permit us to do this month.
We've had to put off the Captain's sixty thousand light-year
overhaul 'till March.   
(EXIT NURSE)


.mc 
That's right Miss Booby, just go to sleep for a while now, sleep tight. 


.pz 
Victory to the duodenum. (SLEEPILY) 


.mc 
That's right, lull yourself to sleep.

There, she's asleep.
Well, I can keep on giving her shots to keep her out until I
get in touch with the others.

Open channel D please.  
[ uncle music??]
Yes, yes, hello?  All right.


I have one of the Boobies and I'll soon have the other. 
What do you mean you can't pick me up?  
You didn't get a ship?  
What do you mean 10 kilos?  
That's

SHIP,   
with a "P" Woundwort!   
Well, don't worry about it, I'll figure some way to get down.   
All power to you too......
