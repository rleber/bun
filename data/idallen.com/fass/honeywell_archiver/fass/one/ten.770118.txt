Act 1, Scene 10 - Rendezvous


.je 
I assure you that your sister - she is your 
sister isn't she? - will be perfectly all right.
Doctor McIntosh went to the finest medical school   
in all the Galaxy and came out with at least a  
B average in most of his courses.  I think that's   
what he said; either that or he started out as a
swordsman and decided to take a stab at brain surgery,  
I forget which. 
In the three years he's been with the Satirize  
he has found out all sorts of things that medical   
science never knew before, and some of them have even   
worked once or twice.  It's a good thing that he
only tries his chancy cures out on the main 
characters of the show - he might not have quite such good  
luck if the people who were taking his potions  
weren't on 3 year contracts.  But   
enough of all this, what about you? 


.pd 
What would you like to know Captain?


.je 
Well, just tell me about Booby and the people on
it.  We know that it is rich in silicon deposits -  
the hills are just full of the stuff - but beyond   
that, Booby has kept itself pretty well to its own, 
and the Pederasty hasn't really butted in like they 
do on most planets.  Oops.  


.pd 
We have been briefed on your Pederasty, both here   
and at home.  We have been briefed on a great   
number of things, Captain Jerk. 


.je 
Such as?


.pd 
Our chief advisor, the honoured Booby Begonia...


.je 
That name strikes a familiar note.  


.pd 
...has warned us that you will try to sweep us off  
our feet with your masculine charm, and woo 
the silicone out of us at a completely unreasonable 
price.  


(JERK REMOVES THE ARM THAT HE WAS JUST IN   
THE ACT OF PUTTING ABOUT HER WAIST.)    


She told us that
the Pederasty was not above that sort of thing. 


.je 
Your chief advisor is a woman?  


.pd 
Most of the people in power are women on Booby. 
Men are such flighty things after all, their
minds more often tending towards matters of 
romance and pie in the sky - or elsewhere.  
Few can keep their minds on business
long enough to come to a bargain or negotiate a 
settlement.  Their minds wander no further than 
their hands in most cases.  


.je 
Indeed.  In the dark past of the Pederasty, particularly my planet  
Earth, the same thoughts were held, except  
that the men were in power and the women were thought   
as brainless noodleheads who were not fit to
be in command, and were not even capable of 
performing even the simplest tasks on their own.
Just a minute and I'll  hold the door open  
for you there - these are my quarters.  


.pd 
Your quarters, Captain? 


.je 
I thought that we might rest here for a time,   
and get to know each other better.  
It's a long flight to Beta Quarelius Trigamma   
Epsilon Three, where the OSPEC meetings will
be held.


.pd 
It sounds like a Frat house.


.je 
In many ways it is.  They go on panty raids 
to the nearby Mu Alpha Gamma Upsilon system every so
often and hang everything that they pick up on the  
edge of a chronosynclastic infundibulum for all the 
world to see until the girls go and get the stuff back. 


.pd 
What is a chronosynclastic infundibulum?


.je 
I'll tell you later.  Would you like to sit 
down and have some Saurian Brandy?  


.pd 
If you like.


.je 
Here I'll get you some and then I have  
to go and just check in with the computer about 
something that Mr. Jock said earlier, something 
that is nagging me.  There you go, an excellent year.   


.pd 
(READING THE LABEL) Stardate 2534.5.


.aa COMPUTER
Recording.  


.je 
Erase!  (TO PRIDE)  I don't think that you should   
say something like that around here.  It's  
automatically set to start taping the instant   
it hears the word Stardate- 


.aa COMPUTER
Recording.  


.je 
Erase, dammit. -the instant it hears, uh,   
that word, and I don't think that we
really want to be recorded.  It would just excite   
Jock when he cleans up the tapes at the end of the  
month.  


.pd 
As you say. 


.je 
I'll be right back now. 


(PRIDE NODS.  AS JERK LEAVES THE ROOM, SHE WANDERS  
ABOUT LOOKING AT THE TRINKETS SPREAD HERE   
AND THERE ABOUT THE PLACE: A KLINGON WAR DILDO, 
A REPLICA OF THE FAMOUS STATUE OF THE TWO FOUNDING  
ROMULANS SUCKING AT THE BREASTS OF A BAREEPY

ALL WITH DIFFERENT NAMES, AND A DARTBOARD WITH THE FACE 
OF MARTIN LANDAU ON IT.  SHE TURNS FROM ALL THIS
PARAPHENALIA, AND SPEAKS TO HERSELF.)   


.pd 
So the great Captain Jerk will now try to win my
heart and the silicone of Booby.  Well, I shouldn't 
blame the poor dear, he really tries his
best for the Pederasty, in whatever way he can. 
Running a starship is a big responsibility for men, 
and I don't know if the poor things can handle it.  
Still, they seem to be doing fairly well for all
their limitations.  (PAUSE)  I wonder what he'll
try.  The Saurian Brandy is just a start of 
course.  Still, it's better than Tang.  (SIPS)  
It might even be exciting.  Word has got out
about our dear Captain Jerk, even on Booby. 
I've heard stories...   


.nf 
.in+5   
I've heard that Jerk is an animal   
Just imagine it, and soon he'll go  
to work on little me.   
He'll try to fill me full of brandy 
Get me feeling randy
Try to take a little liberty.   


He'll say "My dear, your eyes   
are so delightful   
I've never seen a finer shade of blue.  
Oh, dearest Pride, I'd love to have 
a sightful  

Of them, a nightful 
of you!"


Oh, yes, that Jerk is an animal,
Yes undoubtedly,
When he gets back, he'll try his little play .  
He'll say he can't live without me  
Say he'll never doubt me
Call me, maul me, put his arms about me,
And I will gladly tell him that he may! 
.in8
.fi 


After all, anything's better than a boring  
spaceflight, even if our chief advisor did say  
that mingling with non-boobies was bestiality.  


(SHE CONTINUES TO HUM WHILE THE LIGHTS DIM ON   
HER HALF OF THE STAGE AND WE SEE JERK SITTING   
BESIDE THE COMPUTER.)   
(LIGHTS UP ON JERK.)


.je 
All right, computer, tell me everything that you
know about Boobies. 


.aa COMPUTER
Working.  Boobies: Twentieth century slang  
for ...

Not that.  The planet Booby and its inhabitants.


.aa COMPUTER
The planet Booby.  In Tau Iota Tau system, second planet
from the sun.  Volume: 5.98 times l0 to the 24th herms. Distance
from Tau Iota Tau:0.98 A.U.  Crust composition:...  


.je 
Enough of that.  What I want to know is 
something about the romantic lives of the   
inhabitants.  I want something that really turns    a sithem on.

them on.


.aa COMPUTER
No on-off switch contained in life-forms.   


.je 
That wasn't what I was talking about.  Come 
on computer, she's got me stumped.  I've
got to make a play for her for the Pederasty.   
And for the network - it's in my contract.  But 
this is a completely different type of woman
than I've ever met in all my travels through    
space.  How do I handle her?

(ASIDE)  Who programmed this computer?  
I'd like to find that debugger. 
(TO COMPUTER)  You're sure that there's nothing 
else.   


.aa COMPUTER
Nothing that we can say in what is ostensibly   
a family show.  


.je 
Well, I guess that I'll just have to go back
and grasp the situation with both hands.


.aa COMPUTER
Gulp.

UP AND SAYS:)

 I wonder what the Captain is doing tonight 
 What deviltry is that Jerk pursuing tonight.

.fi 


(ENTER JERK.)   


.pd 
Just as well, I couldn't think of any more  
of the words.   


.je 
Sorry to keep  you waiting.  One of the 
crew said that he saw some guy dressed all in   
silver flying past one of the portholes, on 
a surfboard of all things, and we had to check  
it out. 


.pd 
Oh, really.  Was it true?   


.je 
Well, we found something clogging up one of 
the number three vents, but it was wearing  
a red suit trimmed with white ermine and had little bits of 
reindeer sticking to it.  It's amazing what sort of things you  
run into out here in space.  There are more things flying   
these days than ever before.  But   
enough of this.  Would you like some more   
Saurian Brandy? 


.pd 
Captain, if I didn't know better, I would   
think that  you were trying to make me  
drunk.  


.je 
Good thing you know better.  (ASIDE)  I hope
she doesn't know better.


.pd 
How long will the journey take Captain? 


.je 
Oh, at least another twenty-four hours, I   .nf would say.  If you w

would say.  If you want the exact time, you 
can ask Jock the next time you see him  
tomorrow morning.   


(PRIDE RAISES HER EYEBROWS.  JERK SMILES,   
AND WALKS TOWARDS HER MEANINGFULLY.)


.pd 
Captain?


.je 
I'm sorry.  It's just that, I've
never seen eyes of such a beautiful,
ahhhh  (HE CHECKS)...blue.  


.pd 
(LAUGHS)  I see.


.je 
I don't know if  you realize this my dear,  
but there are really very few things of any 
great interest to do on a long spaceflight. 
Ohhh, we sometimes come across bug-eyed 
monsters, or amoebae the size of a galaxy,  
narrowly avert an intergalactic war every now   
and then, but basically we don't have anything to do.   
And the women here are nothing to think about.  
They all call you Captain, and fall 
dutifully into your arms when the moment calls  
for it, but it's really nothing that lasts until
the next week.  It's lonely being the captain of
a big starship, and I was wondering if you'd
care to make it a little less lonely.   


.pd 
Maybe I could have you sent a pet from Booby.   
We have some delightful little animals there,   
a Basilisk perhaps? 


.je 
I don't think you're following me.  


.pd 
You're following me.


.je 
One way or another. 


.pd 
Captain, is it me you love, or do you love  
me for  my silicon? 


.je 
Does it matter? 


.pd 
No. 


(THEY RUN TOWARDS EACH OTHER LIKE THE PEOPLE
IN A HAIRSPRAY COMMERCIAL.  AT THAT MOMENT  
MACINTOSH COMES THROUGH THE DOOR.)  


.mc 
Excuse me but am I intruding?   


(JERK AND THE BOOBY RUN INTO EACH OTHER AND 
FALL FLAT ON THEIR CANS.)   


.je 
Ahhhh, not a bit Doctor, we were
just furthering interplanetary relations.   


.pd 
What is it?  Is there something wrong with  
my sister?  


.mc 
Well, I'm not sure.  Maybe you had  
better come down soon, and then you can fill
me in on some of the details about the booby    
physique that I don't know.  She tells  
me that  you were studying to be a doctor   
before you became the Pride.


.pd 
Yes, all right, can it wait?  The captain was   
going to uhhh, show me some of his medals.  


.mc 
All out of etchings, eh?  Well, don't   
make it too long.   


.je 
Which one of us were you speaking to?   n't 



.pd 
Oh, maybe I had better go with the doctor now,  
get this over with, and then I can come back
and we can look at your medallions  
and what have you.  


.je 
Need you ask?   


.pd 
It wasn't a question.  All right Doctor, lead the   
way.


.je 
Come back quick.


(THEY LEAVE)


Drat. Drat, drat, drat.  I could almost 
feel my hands on that silicon.  
She's a nice kid, too.  It's too bad that her   
sister got sick.
Oh well, I'm sure the Doctor will take good 
care of her.

(WOLF WHISTLE)  Captain Jerk.

Jerk here.

I think that you had better come up to the  
bridge, sir.  We've found something strange.

I'm on my way.  Jerk off.  (PAUSE)

beautiful music together.
