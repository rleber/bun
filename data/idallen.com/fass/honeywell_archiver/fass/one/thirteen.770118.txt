.FO 'ACT I SCENE XIII''FASS'
Act 1, Scene 13 - Transporter Room  


.rb 
Blast, I thought that the transporter would be unguarded
at this hour of the night.  You there, yeoman, what are you doing here? 


.aa YEOMAN  
Waiting for the ship to come in line with Quinqus Senteria Iota 
Gamma Four, sir.


.rb 
But that's in the next system - we won't reach that for another hour at least.  


.aa YEOMAN  
I have my orders, sir.  


.rb 
What do we want on that planet anyway?  They don't make anything
of importance there.


.aa YEOMAN  
We're transporting up three hundred tons of Turkish Delight.


.rb 
That's ridiculous.  


.aa YEOMAN  
Haven't you ever heard of transports of delight?


.rb 
I wish I hadn't.  Say, yeoman, you're looking a little peaked;  
have you been taking all your space pills?  Have you had your   
Gertrude Stein flu vaccination yet? 


.aa YEOMAN  
Why no, sir, but I've had all the standard flu vaccinations. A  
vaccination is a vaccination is a vaccination, sir. 


.rb 
I'm the doctor around here and I say it sounds like you need a  
shot.   


(HE LEAPS AND INJECTS THE YEOMAN WITH HIS FLIT CAN.)


.aa YEOMAN  
What...victory to the Icelandic people! 


.rb 
Maybe that batch should have been stirred up a little - 
it seems as if it was a little impure.  


.aa YEOMAN  
All hail the glorious revolution of Tonga.  


.rb 
Yes, yes, very well, why don't you come and help me bring   
in the Boobies. 


.aa YEOMAN  
I have nothing to lose but my brains.   


.rb 
Well said.  


(THEY GO OFFSTAGE AND BRING ON THE BOOBIES.  THE BOOBIES
ARE TIED UP VERY LOOSELY.  PRICE IS STILL SLEEPING, BUT 
PRIDE IS WIDE AWAKE AND ANGRY. SHE IS GAGGED.)  


.rb 
Well, there they are.  They both played right into my   
hands.  Now all I have to do is get them down to the    
planet.  Tell me, are the co-ordinates for the  
transporter set?


.aa YEOMAN  
A glorious, victorious yes. 


.rb 
This guy is getting on my nerves.  Ah, yeoman, do you have  
a phaser on you?  Could I borrow it for a second?   

 is .aa YEOM

.aa YEOMAN  
Property is slavery.


.rb 
Don't break it, just give it to me.  All right, how do  
you set these things?  Shall I factorial him or perhaps 
use a barrage of gamma functions?  No, he might turn green and start
jumping about shouting, "People Smash Puny Imperialists!"   
Hyperbolic sine?  No, I'll just hit him with a cosh.


(HE DOES SO AND THE YEOMAN CRUMBLES)    


All right, is that  
everything?  We're over the planet now, and it should be
easy to beam down.  Just one little problem.  I've got to   
figure out some way that they won't be able to follow me.   
Sabotage the transporter?  But then, how could I get down   
to the planet after I sabotaged it?  I know!  I'll destroy the  
ring modulator.  Yes, yes, my proud Boobie, what is it? 


(HE REMOVES PRIDE'S GAG.)   


.pd 
What's a ring modulator?


.rb 
A lot of people were hoping you'd ask that.  You see,   
that's the value of asking questions, because if there's
something you don't know, the odds are good that half the   
class wants to ask the same question but are too afraid 
to do so.  Never be afraid of asking questions my dear. 


.pd 
What's a ring modula

What's a ring modulator?


.rb 
Don't repeat yourself, my dear , it's bad form. 


.pd 
But I want to know what a ring modulator is.


.rb 
A ring modulator is just an ideal little module, developed  
by a group of monoids over on Clifford Grassmann Three, 
to govern the fields of energy over the domain of   
topological space through which the transported body
is sent.  I could explain it in more detail, but why
bother you with the algebra.


.pd 
That doesn't tell me a great deal.  


.rb 
What it boils down to is that this little baby was  
installed so its destruction would mean that the    
transporter would malfunction a few minutes after the   
part was destroyed, and thereafter it would be unsafe   
to transport anything bigger than a bread box.  


.pd 
Why a bread box?


.rb 
Don't ask such stupid questions.


.pd 
You remind me of a professor I had in...


.rb 
Quiet.  (HE PUTS THE GAG BACK ON HER.)  Too bad I used  
the last of my MLM triple-T on that yeoman, or I'd  
give you a shot too.  Okay, he said that everything 
was set, so I guess I just pull the switch and go.  


(ENTER JOCK)


.jo 
Not so fast, Macintosh. 


.rb 
What?   


.jo 
I'll make no bones about it. Macintosh, you're a spy.   


.rb 
All right, you've got me Jock, but you'll never 
catch me.  My phaser is set on arctan and it will kill  
you by degrees. 


.jo 
Do not be a fool, whoever you are.  You are acting most 
illogically.


.rb 
I warn you, don't take another step.  Too bad for you.  
Take that. And that.  And that.  And a couple more. 
I don't understand, Mr. Jock.  Why didn't you intersect 
the floor at an odd angle?  


.jo 
I'm a Vulcan: nothing phases me.


.rb 
Then I guess I'd just better run for it.


(HE FLICKS  
A SWITCH ON THE CONTROL PANEL, KICKS JOCK OUT OF THE    
WAY, AND JUMPS ON THE TRANSPORTER PLATFORM WITH THE 
BOOBIES.  JOCK GETS UP OFF THE FLOOR, RUNS TO THE   
CONTROL PANEL, AND GRABS A KNOB ON THE CONSOLE.     
IT COMES OFF.   
BRASSIERE AND THE BOOBIES DISAPPEAR.  JERK AND THE  
REST OF THE LANDING CREW ENTER ALMOST IMMEDIATELY.) 


.je 
What is it, Jock?   


.jo 
As I expected, Dr. Macintosh was not the real McCoy.


.je 
An impostor?


.cl 
I thought that he had been slouching a little lately.   


.je 
Well, where is he now?  


.jo 
He attempted to beam down to the planet, but I was  
able to change the co-ordinates of the transporter  
to send him to the farm house we have in tow.   


.je 
Strapping good, Jock.  Torothy, is there by any chance an intergalactic 
hyperspoce Jammison-Freeby communications device    
installed in the farm house?


.ty 
Uncle Ben has a CB. 


.je 
Same thing.  Lieutenant Huaryu, raise the farm house.   
I want to talk to our impostor. 


.hu 
Yes, sir.  Breaker one-eight, breaker one-eight, this   
is Foxy Lady calling Appleseed, do you read me, good
buddy?  


.rb 
(VOICE OVER)  Blast it, how did you send me here?   


.je 
Jock was quick on the draw. 


.hu 
No names, Captain.  He means that you can chalk that one    
up to Mr. Pointy-ears, good buddy.  


.je 
You can't get away now.  We can just leave you over 
there and drag you to the nearest space station and 
you couldn't do a thing about it.   


.rb 
Drat, you're right!  All right, we'll negotiate.


.je 
Negotiate!  What do you have for bargaining power?  


.rb 
Ahh, let me see.


(A FLUSHING SOUND IS HEARD IN THE   
BACKGROUND.)


.je 
What was that?  


.rb 
Oh, just one of the Boobies upstairs.  Look, I'm sure   
that I have something to bargain with.  


.je 
Was she...ah... flushing something? 


.rb 
Well, what do you think she was doing?  Look, I'm   
sure there must be something  I have that I can trade,  
at least for my freedom.


.je 
Ahhh, I don't know about that, but the Pederasty was
founded on the principles of diplomacy, good will and   
all those other things that they talk about all the time.   
I think that we can afford to talk.  I'll beam right    
over.   


.aa ALL 
We'll go with you. (AND SIMILAR SOUNDS) 


.je 
Look, we'll have to - er - negotiate in shifts.  Jock,  
due to your unusual biological makeup, you can remain   
behind. 


.su 
Unusual biological makeup, Sir? 


.je 
Yes, Jock's intestines are in his head. (JOCK SPITS.)   
Now, first off, I'll take Lieutenant Huaru, Lieutenant  
suru, Ensign Gogol- 


.to 
That's Tolstoy. 


.je 
Ensign Whatever and Nurse Chappedlips.  Oh, we'd better 
take you along too, Torothy,  so that you can show us   
the lay-out of the house.   


.ty 
All right.  Can I bring Dodo?   


.je 
If you must, but you'll have to hold him - only six 
transporter disks.  Mr. Jock?   


.jo 
Yes, sir.  Ready?   


.je 
Ready.  This shouldn't take long, Jock. We'll be back   
in a flush - er - energize.     


(THEY DISAPPEAR)
