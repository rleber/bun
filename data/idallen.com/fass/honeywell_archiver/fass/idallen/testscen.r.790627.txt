(WE ARE ON DECK.  A FEW DECK CHAIRS AROUND AND SMALL TABLES.  A FEW PEOPLE  
SIT AROUND IN BATHING SUITS AND SUNGLASSES TANNING, AND DRINKING EXOTIC-LOOKING 
DRINKS.  ADMIRAL AND MRS.TV AND THE PURSER ARE SITTING TOGETHER AT ONE OF   
THE TABLES. 
THEY ARE SEMI-OBLIVIOUS TO ALL THAT HAS TRANSPIRED)

Isn't the sun glorious, bunny?  Doesn't it make you feel like all your troubles 
are a million miles away?   
.ch p3  
Last I heard, the pirates were only two kilometres behind us and gaining fast.  
.ch p2  
Are those two nautical kilometres or statute?   
.ch p1  
Pirates?  What nonsense!  We'll outrun them.  This is the sort of day   
that nothing could go wrong.

You know, dear, I don't like to contradict you, but a lot   
of things have gone wrong so far on this trip.  
Just two minutes ago I got my laundry back from the ship's cleaners 
and they'd mixed mine with someone else's.  I found the oddest suit 
with leather straps and black lace and...   
.ch p3  
And brass buckles?  
.ch qq  
That's right, brass buckles.
