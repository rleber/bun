Writing a "formal" paper on the topic of a "personal" inquiry   
serves immediately to confound one's ability to write;  
all recourse to the comfortable ambiguities of third-person 
discourse is lost.  
A mind steeped in the rigours of ponderous exposition will  
not easily adapt to the use of the first-person.
However, if this work is to have meaning beyond another incomplete survey   
of the current literature, then formality must necessarily  
be sacrificed.  
.pb 
This paper is divided into five sections.   
The Introduction contains the "soft" data - 
the personal interests and experiences whcih gave rise to this inquiry. 
The sections on Causes, Components, and Treatments summarize the
"hard" data culled from the literature of the past decade and a half
of asthma research. 
The paper ends with a Conclusion, which briefly responds to 
salient points uncovered in the research.   
.pb 
In this format, it is hoped that both the personal element and the  
formal content may be agreeably balanced.

.pb 
My personal interest in asthma stems from two seemingly separate
(both in time and place) circumstances. 
Normally healthy, and with no prior difficulties,   
I was puzzled as to the nature of these two asthma-producing
environments, and especially in the inconsistent manner in which
I seemed to respond to them.
Each factor I considered as being a possible irritant was also  
present under circumstances when I was feeling perfectly well.  
.pb 
A consultation with an allergist turned up a random (I thought) 
array of skin sensitivities to items such as mold, cats, dogs,  
dust, grass, and maple trees (!?).  
Having lived in houses with both cats and dogs ever since I can 
remember, I could not understand why I should be reacting   
this late in life.  
Yet, in roughousing with a friend's dog, I found my hand
irritated by the saliva from the dog getting into the small 
abrasions received while playing.   
How did I acquire this pronounced reaction? 
.pb 
Compounding the confusion was the erratic manner in which these new 
"allergies" would assert themselves.
On some days, my breathing was severely affected (I was living  
in an apartment with a cat on both occasions).  
Other days, or weeks, would pass when I was perfectly normal.   
Logially, it could not solely be my environment which was   
contributing to my sensitivity; still, the advice I received
from the allergist was purely environmental in nature:  
get rid of the cat, and keep a dust-free room.  
Hearing that allergies were largely (all?) psychosomatic,   
I sought to explain things through reference to the similarities
of the emotional aspects of the two circumstances.  
.pb 
Problems had first appeared towards the end of two years
I had spent living with a girlfriend.   
Life was getting more difficult, and we would spend many late   
nights trying to balance our needs for independence and 
dependence. 
My feelings during my "attacks", as best I can recall, were ones
of feeling trapped in the situation, and wishing to be left alone.  
.pb 
We parted, and I came to University where I had no problems whatsoever. 
Two years passed, until I again found myself living with a female,  
this time my best friend, and again the "attacks" returned. 
The environment was, for the first time in two years, again similar to  
that in which I had first experienced difficulty: old apartment,
dusty, and with a cat.  
Here, the symptoms were much more severe, and I became quite annoyed
that I couldn't isolate a simple physical cause; the symptoms   
were still irregular.   
.pb 
I again wondered at the results of the skin tests.  
I could grant that a muscular activity such as a bronchial  
spasm could be psychologically caused, this seemed plausible
in the light of the ability of people to control other "involuntary"
musculature; however, I could   
.ul 
not 
see how emotional factors could fix the results of a skin test. 
How could I "will" myself to react to only a select few of the  
applied allergens?  
If my body chemistry was set up to react to these substances,   
then it seemed likely that I would have noticed it before now.  
Either my symptoms needed the peculiar combination of emotional 
factors currently operating at the time in order to show,   
or I had perhaps "learned" a sensitivity to these substances
through being upset while in contact with them. 
.pb 
Given a sufficiently unpleasant environment it is conceivable that, 
in addition to the recognized psychological distaste we may 
be conditioned to or learn, we may also muster more basic   
physiology in a reaction against substances or smells   
present in that environment.
There are likely allergies which are biologically determined,   
but perhaps also allergies which have been pscyhologically cultivated.  
Once such an allergy is instilled, the psychlogical cause may vanish
and still leave the physiological sensitivity.  
.pb 
In a reciprocal manner, a physiological sensitivity may condition   
a psychological avoidance such that even without the actual presence
of the allergen, an allergic response is forthcoming.   
As neuroticism is the psychological manifestation of a form of  
sensitivity, an allergic (asthmatic) reaction may be the
somatic expression of the same thing.   
Thus, emotional asthma and physiological asthma may be two  
different manifestations of the same basic problem: an aversion 
to some environmentally distasteful situation.  
.pb 
This method of looking at allergies seemed to have a great deal of  
application to my current situation.
The skin allergies I had developed were to substances common to the 
stressful environments I was living in. 
Perhaps most convincing was the selective allergy to maple trees,   
for these trees surrounded both apartments I occupied!  
.pb 
My experiences being only circumstantial, we now turn to the literature 
for support.

Without immediately substantiating the difference between emotionally based 
and physiologially based asthma, let us look at the backgrounds 
of asthmatics, and at the psychological environments in which   
attacks occur.

Herbert (1964) collected a list of the attributes researchers   
commonly applied to asthmatics, along with the frequency count  
of each. The first 8 are listed in Table 1.

The usefulness of such a listing is greatly reduced by the absence of a 
similar listing for comparison with non-asthmatics; but,
in conjunction with other studies, a pattern becomes evident.   
Freeman reviewed the literature current to 1964 and 
observed that:  
.qb10   
"...conflict around excessive unresolved dependence on the  
mother was such that a threat of separation from her could  
precipitate an asthmatic attack. ...An attack represented   
a suppressed cry for the mother." (Freeman, 1964)   
.qe10   nds~Freeman also

Freeman also noted that the seeming inability of asthmatics to cry  
(see Table 1, item 7) removes for them that form of tension release.
.pb 
Rees (1963) attempted to differentiate the parents of asthmatics
from the parents of non-asthmatic children. 
He defined two categories of parents:   
those with "satisfactory" attitiudes towards child-rearing, 
and those with "unsatisfactory" attitudes.  
"Unsatisfactory" was taken to mean highly overprotective, perfectionistic,  
and displaying much overt rejection of the child.   
The study indicated that 56% of the parents of asthmatic children had these 
"unsatisfactory" attitudes, as compared with only 18% of the
parents of the normal control group.
The major factor operating in this difference was a large increase in the   
overprotectiveness of the asthmatic children's parents. 
Block et al. (1964) confirmed this finding, noting that the mothers of  
asthmatics over-invested in their children, as well as showing signs of 
over-identification and over-dependency.
There is also evidence that these parents were punitive, authoritarian, 
and restrictive in their attitudes towards child-rearing (Purcell et al., 1969b).   )   In a more recent review of t

In a more recent review of the literature, Kelly & Zeller consider  
that the role of the family in fostering asthma is as yet unclear (1969).

.pb 
That which is the initial cause of an individual's asthma is likely 
to remain the dominant factor throughout, especially when the cause 
appears to have an emotional or stressful basis (Rees, 1964b).  
Cases with an emotional factor as the major or only precipitant 
constitute a minority of the total cases of asthma (Kelly & Zeller, 
1969; Tal & Miklich, 1976). 
Thus for the majority of cases some somatic predisposition is indicated.
.pb 
Studies illustrating the psychological component of asthma abound.  
Luparello et al. (1968) had subjects showing symptoms when inhaling a   
neutral saline solution which they were led to believe was an irritant. 
Remission could be achieved by another neutral solution which the   
subjects thought was a bronchial relaxant.  
One subject went so far as to selectively develop the symptomology  
of hay fever and asthma when she thought she was inhaling pollen,   
and only the asthma symptomology when told she was inhaling dust!   centNon-asthmati

Non-asthmatics failed to react. 
.pb 
Weiss et al. (1976) induced asthmatic symptoms in 12 - 15 year old  
asthmatics by showing them a film of other children with similar breathing  
difficulties. Tal & Miklich (1976) demonstrated that emotional arousal  
"decreases pulmonary function" in asthmatic children.   
Miklich et al. (1973) stated:   
.qb10   
"Apparently it is the threat of some undesireable consequence rather than   
the actual delivery of it that provokes the responses which lead to 
emotionally induced asthma."

Two controversies exsist in the literature of the past decade.  
First, given that asthma has both a psychological and physiological 
basis, what is the nature of the relation between the two?  
Second, does the asthmatic have a personality which differs 
significantly from that of either normals and/or persons with   
other chronic illnesses?
.bs 
A) Somatic or Psychological Factors?
.ix 
~~~~~A)~Somatic~or~Psychological~Factors?~	^%

.pb 
That there are at least two readily distinguishable classes 
of asthmatics was well demonstrated by Purcell et al. (1969a).  
His team divided asthmatic children into two groups using the criterion 
of the apparent emotional or psychological basis of their symptoms. 
He predicted in advance that separation from the family would have a large  
effect on those children whose asthma was emotionally caused, and   
little effect on the other group. This prediction was confirmed.
An analysis to detemine the nature of the relationship between the  
emotional and somatic factor showed no significant trends (1969b).  
This lack of relationship is supported by Tal & Miklich (1976). 
.pb 
In keeping with the perverse nature of scientific research, 
this finding has been contradicted by others.   
Feingold (1962) used the MMPI in a study of asthmatic women,
and found that those women with the weakest skin sensitivities  
(i.e. lowest somatic component) had the higher deviancy scores on the   
personality inventory (i.e. the higher psychological predisposition).   
This inverse relationship was also found by Block et al. (1964),
who in addition found a higher psychopathology in the mothers of
children with low somatic predispositions.  
.pb 
Not to be content with insignificant correlations and negative  
correlations, Jacobs et al. (1966) found the remaining relationship:
a positive correlation! 
He found that   
.ul 
both
factors had to be present in order for the symptoms to show.
Persons with a high psychopathology but low in somatic sensitivity were 
.ul 
neurotic,   
not asthmatic.  
In a second study the following year (1967) Jacobs et al. revised this  
positive correlation theory to that of a "summation" theory, where  
the 
.ul 
sum 
of the psychological and physiological factors determined the extent of the symptomology.   
.pb 
Block subsequently took exception to Jacobs' findings, and did a second 
analysis on Jacobs' data which supported her theory of an inverse relationship  
(Block, 1968).  
The most recent work by Kagan & Weiss (1976) supports this theory.

Kelly's review of the literature (1969) concluded that there was no 
distinct "asthmatic personality".
