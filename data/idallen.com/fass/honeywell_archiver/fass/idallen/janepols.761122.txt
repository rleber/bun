The structure of Canadian municipal government is often seen as a blend of  
British and 
American ideas.  British tradition was followed in the early days of Canadian   
municipal government as most of the inhabitants chose to remain loyal to    
Britain rather than seek  independent status.  Gradually however, Canada
came to depend on and was greatly influenced by the powerful neighbour to the   

south.  The principle perhaps being "the people of that country more
nearly resemble our own in urban and rural districts, and we may reasonably 
conclude that whatever works satisfactorily amongst them is not wholly  
unsuited to us". 1

Several American ideas of municipal government began to be adapted and  
modified to meld with British tradition to suit Canadian needs.  Such   
practices include the popular election of mayor, the council-commission system  
of government and the council-manager form of government, among others.

This paper is particularly concerned with the last of these - the   
council-manager system of government.  The author is particularly interested in 
tracing the development of the council-manager plan in the United   
States to its development and adaptation to Canadian needs. Particular  
emphasis will be placed on the process by which the plan came to the City   ur tof Kitchener. The author also intends to answerthe q

of Kitchener. The author also intends to answerthe question why 
the council-manager system was accepted in Kitchener.

Before the council-manager system can be fully understood in a  
Canadian context it is necessary to examine the American origins
of the system.  Council-manager government was first developed  
in the United States during the early nineteen hundreds.
Power in the municipal U. S. was often parcelled out among  
elected administrative officials often of differing political   
backgrounds.
Different administrative groups were often set against one another  
and there was no single person to manage or co-ordinate activities. 
It was decided that a single concentration of administrative control
would perhaps avoid the corruption of party politics and attract
worthwhile candidates.  
.sp 
.ne3
.ti5
The council-manager system is based on the idea of running a city like  
a business.  The manager, an appointed professional,  would be in charge
of administering the city and would answer to the mayor and elected 
councillors who would function as board members debating issues and 
voting on policy.  In effect the system was based on the    
separation of policy and administration.

The duties can be seen as strictly administrative with ease of  
operation in the fact that one man, the city manager, will be fully 
aware of the functions and jobs of each department.  He will be able
to co-ordinate them to prevent overlap of programs and present all  
information to the council.

There are several basic advantages of the council-manager   
system of government some of which have been mentioned above.   
Another advantage of this system is that it leaves  
council free for the formulation of policy rather than  
worrying about collecting taxes, removing snow, preparing   ted the 

the budget etc.  The city can be administered by someone
trained in professional management.  In fact, there are 
programs asociated with several universities to train officials 
to be city managers and other administrative officials. 
The author believes that one of the chief advantages of 
an appointed manager rather than those previously elected   
(U. S.) is the continuity of administration.
A well-trained manager knowledgeable in the affairs of the city will
be able to accurately present facts and figures to each new 
council.  Long range planning will be equally feasible with a   
manager who is employed for an indefinite period and is aware   
of successive phases in the growth of a city.   
.sp

The council-manager system as it stands in the U.`S., and to
some extent in Canada, suffers from several blatant 
deficiencies.  According to Thomas J. Plunkett: 
.ss 
.sp2
.in10   
.ll50   
The principle defect in the council-manager plan is the 
assumption upon which the whole scheme is based - that policy   
and administration can somehow be completely separated. 
Few will deny the desirability of making a partial  
separation of these functions, but it is questionable if an 
elected council of laymen can initiate mush in the way of policy
without having some acquaintance with the problems of administration,   
and these under the council-manager plan, are the exclusive 
responsibility of the city-manager.  The manager may often be   
in the position to suggest and initiate policy recommendations  
with council being placed in the position of not being able to  
fully evaluate the manager's recommendations. 3

There has been much criticism as to whether the council-manager 
plan is necessary in Canada.  It was originally developed to meet   
entirely different conditions from those found in Canada.  As was   
noted earlier however, Canadians have often adapted various 
aspects of British and American tradition to suit their needs.  
The council commissioner form and the council-manager forms of  
government are two of the ideas which have been adapted to  
Canadian municipal government.  
.sp 
.ne3
.ti5
Unlike many of the larger cities in the U. S., Canadian 
local government can be said to be relatively free from 
corruption other than the occasional debatable case of  
conflict of interest.  The absence of political parties 
from local government also differs significantly from that  
of the U. S.  Civic officials in Canada have always been
appointed and this  
.ul 
generally   
tends to avoid the election of incompetents.
.sp 
.ne3
.ti5
Many Canadian municipalities have already developed a close 
approximation of the manager plan over the years without
the need for any formal adoption at all!  The clerk or  
clerk-treasurer, in many instances, often has to deal with the majority 
of municipal departments and council committees may often go to this
person for information and reports.  He is often recognized, by way of  
tradition and custom as the chief administrative official.  If  
the area and the council is small enough there should be little 
difficulty in communication between various departments and the 
council.
.sp 
.ne3
.ti5
In larger communities however, problems may often arise with the
co-ordination and communication between the various departments and 
council.  Some form of management to ensure both economic and   
political efficiency is generally needed.  The budget totals of 
a large city are often similar to those of a large corporate
business and need to be handled as such by someone who can see  
where all of the money is going and how to avoid extreme costs. 
Council committee, council commission, board of control are some
of the forms adopted by large cities as well as the council manager 
system. 
.sp 
.ne3
.ti5
As discussed previously, one of the main problems with the council-manager  
system of government is the separation of policy and
administration.  This is not followed to such an extreme in Canada  
as noted by Plunkett. 4

.ti5
Committees of councillors and interested citizens are often formed to examine   
specific issues and bring their recommendation to the full council.  Often  
the city manager will be asked to prepare a report on a specific problem
using administrative and department expertise.  
.sp 
.ne3
.ti5
The city manager plan was initially adapted in Canada in Quebec where   
several medium-sized cities hired managers. 
The plan has been extremely successful in Halifax as well as several
cities in Ontario.  City manager government has been slow to develop
in Canada principally because many cities already had the informal  
arrangement of having the clerk-treasurer as chief-administrative   
official. Many cities have always been governed by small councils and   
a great deal of co-ordination has not been necessary.  The main point   
to remember is the fact that in Canada the city manager system is not always
undertaken in the same degree.  However, in all cases the manager is
responsible to the council for the operation of the city and in turn
the council is directly responsible to the electors.  This is an
attempt to maintain democratic control and avoid the "rubber stamp" 
appearance this system often has to the public.

We now turn to a specific city, the City of Kitchener to examine its
system of council manager government to determine the changes and   
modifications that have been made to make the system viable     
in the City of Kitchener.

The first discussions of council manager government in the City of  
Kitchener began to take place in 1965 and continued for the next four   
years.  The main discussion centred around the possibility of   
hiring city manager as opposed to a Board of Control.  According
.ne5
to municipal law "a city reaching 100,000 in population must have a 
board of control or by a 2/3 vote of council decide on another  
system". 5

Kitchener's population was rapidly approaching 100,000.  In October 1965
census reports indicate the population was 86,959 an increase of 4.4%   
over 1964 or double that of 1950.`6

A Board of Control would be an elected board with the mayor as its  
chairman and four controllers elected in a general vote.  This group is 
in charge of administration while the entire council, controllers   
included are involved with policy formulation.  Members of a Board of   
Control hold a rather commanding position on city council.  
.sp

Recommendations from the board concerning  the budget, the letting of tenders,  
and the appointment or dismissal of department heads can only be reversed   
by a two-thirds majority of the full council, which includes the board of   
control members.  7

The Kitchener council decided that the city manager system would be best
for the city.  Nine of the ten aldermen and the mayor, Keith Hymmen, were   
in favour of the decision.  The opposing vote was from alderman who 
felt the idea was undemocratic as it was not always possible to separate
policy and administration.

One of the main questions usually asked is, why did Kitchener opt for the   
city manager system rather than a   
Board of Control as found in many other cities of Ontario?  The 
main reason perhaps, is the strong influence of the Chamber of Commerce 
which has long been instrumental in attracting industry to the area and they
believed strongly in the power of the corporation.  The Chamber felt.. ...`,!B...B......
