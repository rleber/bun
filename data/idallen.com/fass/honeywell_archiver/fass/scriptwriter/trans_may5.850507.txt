Theme '86: MYSTERIES


Warm-up slice of reality: the slogan of the University of Washington
Daily is "Where accuracy is a slogan"   


-- locations: haunted house, campfire, isolated island, pyramid,
theatre of the arts, graveyard, foggy street, bermuda triangle, 
sargasso sea
-- more songs: who put the bop, jaws, the sting, syncopated version of  
god rest ye merry gentlemen, twilight zone  
-- are there really any botany 500 stores?  
-- botany 500 sounds like a stock car race or a giant plant 
-- what ever happened to bill toddman? maybe he failed to   
answer the skill-testing question, or when he and mark goodman  
divorced, mark got custody of the game shows
-- 1984 jeopardy "who never existed?" if you answer, you lose. if you   
don't answer, you lose. 
-- cliche: you're all under suspicion; don't anybody leave town 
-- incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial   
-- how that irrelevant got in my pajamas i'll never know

-- game shows are mysteries of a sort - how to win, how to stay on the air  
-- "and is the murderer behind door #1, #2 or #3?"  
-- "assassin #1, how would you kill me?" "well, i'm big on quick and
painless, with any mutilation occurring only after death" "and assassin 
#2, what is your weapon of choice?" "knives. big shiny ones."   
-- Truth or (Nasty) Consequences!   
-- I'm sorry, mrs hagensack, but you failed to answer the skill-testing 
question!

-- "how did you survive?" "i didn't"
-- locked room mystery in an elevator   
-- "don't anybody leave the room" in a sealed room with no exits
-- several obscure, pointed and not especially funny ways to kill hacks 
-- explanation of nazi and cabbage patch kids from last day: result 
is sour kraut!  
-- $25,000 prize if you solve this mystery  
-- do the prize gimmick, and give everyone motives plus ironclad alibis 
so you don't have to give away the money
-- kill the yuppies by poisoning the haagen-daaz, perrier or altering   
the universal gyms  
-- nested villains (robert ludlum)  
-- is that like the sparrow that killed cock robin? 
-- or is that where you peel one open and there's another, smaller  
villain inside him? 
-- the incredible shrinking villain

huge props and sets to show it  
-- what if cast has been shrunk but they can't prove it because 
the whole universe has been shrunk too  
-- large crowd where everyone is a member of the exclusive, secret  
organization

no real members there at all

see if the grass is greener.
-- "don't mind her, she's seventy-four" 
-- how do you keep an englishman happy in his old age? tell him a   
joke when he's young.   
-- the mysterious, clopping, uneven walk you hear behind you in 
the dark fog turns out to be a sound effects man with coconuts, 
looking for the monty python set
-- the big clue to the murder is the clicking sound heard leaving   
the scene of the crime, but every suspect has a way of making that  
sound (castenets, wooden leg, loose spoke on wheelchair)
-- "whew! it's just you, fred" then fred clubs you  
-- someone on stilts, pogo stick

-- BULLETS ARE CHEAP
-- HUH? 
-- DEATH WORE MY NAME TAG: the Convention Murders

in hopes that he'll read it, but accidentally kills the guy 
('his motives were transparent' 'that's the spirit')

it, then have another one show up   
-- doubles of any kind

-- the man who shows up as the detective is either masquerading or  
is an amnesiac, but he is also the supposed victim of the murder,   
corpse whereabouts unknown

reminds someone he was king)
-- on same line, suppose seven scientists construct a machine that  
will transform a hapless subject, and each secretly tests that  
machine, but on the same subject

confessing

-- decaffeinated coffee for angels who want to sleep eternity and stay calm 
-- a mystery writer at a typewriter (typewriter scene) who realizes that
everything he's typing is coming true; after a while he'll get to   
like it and try to capitalize by typing fantasies   
-- everything my newpaper publishes becomes true, but only here 
-- monkey's paw, magic lamp, all wishes stories

-- determine killer by process of elimination: "was it smith?" "no" BANG
-- the last three pages of a mystery novel are missing and they decide  
to reenact it to find out how it ends: anyone with motive, means and
opportunity can try the crime, could be used as a cover for other   
murder motives  

-- detective reveals own killer in will 
-- bring a bunch of detectives together to solve or finish a mystery
novel, use own anticipated murder as excuse to get them together,   
-- an editor murders a writer to use and conceal the writer's perfect   
murder as described in novel

doesn't like
-- sam spade, dying of cancer, wants a more dramatic end and stages 
his big finish as a frameup of sherlock holmes who, about to suicide
in the shameful aftermath, sets up ironsides to take the fall, who ...  
-- "chain letter murders" kill the top ten people on this list, add 
your own victim requests to the bottom, and send this letter to 
10 other people. Within a month, 50,000 people you dislike will have
died. (Union Carbide got a copy of this and we all saw the results.)
-- atomic chain letter: explode a nuclear bomb in the country at
the top of this list ...
-- letters circulated by the post office to reduce population and   
improve service 
-- natural selection this way, cause you kill off all the people who'd  
distribute chain letters!   
-- or use botulism in stamp glue and get everyone who sends mail
(weird age distribut

(weird age distribution)
-- if someone suspects that this botulism thing is happening,   
without knowing the details, picture him sending off a note to  
detectives, licking the stamp, and dying gruesomely before they 
arrive  
-- kill everyone except the detectives "no one leave the planet"

dog behind and the police followed it home, bank robber who wrote the   
holdup note on the back of a personalized cheque, someone who accepted  
a teller's cheque in lieu of cash, dressed as a woman and left lipstick 
lipprint on the glass door he banged into, guy who stole a car and  
was caught selling it back to the original owner, fool who forged
