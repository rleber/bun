I:1 Set The Mood & Start The Show With A Bang!  
______________________________________________  


Approx. length 10 pages 


Scene sketch:   


	Show opens with a dim campfire glowing centre stage.   
	Opening song very eerie mood piece, done sensurround-style 
		in the dark!  
		May start with campfire songs and rounds. 
	Group of teenagers sitting around telling ghost stories
		establish spooky mood further, get the sh*t scared out
		of them and are forced (for some reason) to seek shelter  
		by breaking into . . . The House. 
	Pair of laidback gravediggers watch the kids leave,
		and laconically discuss their probably fate in The House. 
	Break suddenly into crowd-pleasing, upbeat Opening Song #2 
		to end the scene! 


Objectives: 


	#1 -- set eerie, spooky mood!  
	#2 -- introduce teen characters
	#3 -- make the audience jump out of their skins at least once  
	#4 -- introduce the gruesome history of The House (briefly),   
		establish the gravediggers as knowing narrators and   
		set high audience stakes on the teenagers 


Suggestions:



	We need a VERY dramatic introduction of The House. This is a   
		big deal, 'cause this place is going to kill people tonight.  
	We want the scene, and the kids, to parody the horror genre,   
		particularly as seen in contemporary movies!  
	The ghost stories could parallel, echo or foreshadow the rest  
		of the show.  
	Let's start thinking about all the sorts of suspense-building, 
		misdirection and shock tactics it takes to scare folks,   
		'cause we're going to use ALL OF 'EM! This does not preclude  
		laughs at all. One of the best set-ups, in fact, is to
		break suspense with laughter, then get 'em!   


Linda's First Arbitrary Requirement:


	These teenagers are not University of Waterloo students. They  
		are not university students. They haven't even considered 
		their academic futures. So let's not even think about 
		character descriptions that begin with a faculty. 
	Why? We're going to go for the audience's collective throat
		through parody and warping the mystery/detective/horror/  
		thriller genres to get terrific comedy. If we make it 
		generally CONTEXT-FREE, then the jokes about and for  
		the university audience will be all the more unexpected   e th

		and powerful!!!   
	This is not a general rule that I want to see applied to all   
		of FASS every year. But since we're trying to give
		the crowd a few chills as well as thrills this year,  
		I feel we need a more sophisticated, and slightly 
		more indirect, style of humour.   
	So let's think of it as a challenge, from me to you. I'll  
		do my best to keep out the cheap university gags by   
		steering us all away from U.W. characters and setting.
		And you'll all be busy sneaking gags past me by   
		disguising them and/or fitting them into the mystery  
		context! I think the end result will please us all.   


Characters included:
	Entire cast sing opening songs #1 and #2   
	Teenagers: 
		???

I:2 The Sting   
______________________________________________  


Approx. length 5 pages  


Scene sketch:   


	Scene set in small lawyer's office that same evening.  
	Business-like young man "helps" a client (and explains 
		why the lawyer's office is open evenings) and is  
		paid a marvellous fee.
	Client leaves and our young man is revealed to the 
		audience as a con 

		audience as a con man.
	Real lawyer arrives, just as a knock on the door   
		sounds. We freeze the scene at precisely the  
		point where the lawyer (without revealing who 
		is on the other side of the door) says it's a 
		telegram. 


Objectives: 


	#1 -- introduce lawyer's office and establish  
		time as that same evening 
	#2 -- charm audience with con man and entertain
		them with scam
	#3 -- reveal scam to audience  
	#4 -- establish that the lawyer is about to receive
		some urgent (possibly foreboding) news by telegram


Suggestions:


	We need a VERY funny introduction of con man. This is a
		spell of comic relief cleverly disguised as exposition.   


	This scene has minimal plot requirements -- show us the lawyer's   
		office and let us know that he's going to receive big news,   
		probably bad. What we want to do hear is have a field day 
		with our incredibly clever young con artist and the scam! 
	The scope for creativity and comedy here is in the con, and
		in the character of the victim(s), and the character of   
		the lawyer.   
	Keep the set requirements small, since the scenes around this  
		one will keep the techies busy enough.


Characters included:
	Con Man
	Victim(s)  
	Real Lawyer

I:3 Madam Will Be So Pleased That We Have Company   
______________________________________________  


Approx. length 10 pages 


Scene sketch:   


	In the drawing room of The House, our teenagers are
		sneaking in.  
	Doorbell or something rings and they hide as The   
		Loony Caretaker comes through to answer it.   
	A revoltingly all-American family, the Butlers,
		seek shelter for the night.   
	The Caretaker explains the history of The House:   
		no guest has ever survived the night. 
	The Butlers end up staying for some good reason.   
	The teenagers end up staying for some good reason, 
		still hidden. 
	Another group arrives and ends up staying for some good reason.
	Yet another group arrives and stays.   
	People hear mysterious noises, but the Caretaker   
		dismisses them unconvincingly "just . . . the cats,   
		you know" 
	Big dramatic ending to scene is introduction of Madam, 
		who is dead and sitting up casually in the drawing room.  


Objectives: 


	#1 -- get teenagers, Butlers, and two other groups into
		The House for the night   
	#2 -- introduce The Looney Caretaker and dead Madam
	#3 -- scare the audience at least once 
	#4 -- mention spooky noises but explain them away  
		unconvincingly as "cats"  




Suggestions:


	The Caretaker is very threatening and eerie. More genre stuff. 
	This is our one big opportunity to sneak in gratuitous interesting 
		characters before all hell breaks loose.  
	Keep playing on the "everybody will die before dawn" thing.
	The "cats" stuff is essential. We want to arouse both the  
		characters' and the audience's suspicions about the house,
		but make it look like The Caretaker's lying about it. 
		The "cats" are clearly an excuse. 


Characters included:
	The Looney Caretaker   
	Madam Harriet (the trouble with her is that she's dead)
	teenagers  
	the Butler family  
	another group  
	yet another group

I:4 She's Dead, Jim 
______________________________________________  


Approx. length 5 pages  


Scene sketch:   

 to 	Back to the lawyer's office

	Back to the lawyer's office as he opens his door and   
		receives a singing telegram announcing that Harriet is dead.  
	Lawyer reveals details of Harriet's will to con man:   
		her HUGE estate will be split amongst any and all of  
		the relatives who can survive the night in The House  
		with her dead body.   
	If no one survives, he says casually, it all goes to   
		her cats. No one in the audience takes this seriously.
	Con man wants to go to The House and get in on it. 
	Lawyer starts summoning the various relatives. 


Objectives: 


	#1 -- Harriet's dead   
	#2 -- this Harriet is clearly the dead lady in the previous scene  
	#3 -- the terms of the will must be clearly established, but   
		the bit about the cats must be taken as a joke, and just  
		as quickly forgotten  
	#4 -- con man decides to get in on the fun 






Suggestions:


	This scene needs some action and structure, because yet
		again the lawyer's office is stuck with exposition.   
		Maybe something with the con man. 
	Use the cats as a "little old lady's will" joke and do not 
		dwell on them.
	Any way to flesh this out and still keep it brief would
		be welcomed.  



Characters included:
	con man
	lawyer 
	singing telegram person(s)

I:5 Blood's Sicker Than Water   
______________________________________________  


Approx. length 10 pages 


Scene sketch:   


	The relatives arrive at The House and are taken
		to rooms to stay the night by The Caretaker.  
	The con man shows up, masquerading as a relative.  
	The set is basically a corridor of doors where ALL 
		of our cast are spending the night (later to  
		be used for a Keystone Cops scene).   
	Scene ends with "One Night In Hellhouse", sung 
		by various groups coming out of their rooms,  
		filled with dread about the evening, narrated 
		by the Caretaker. Behind them, unbeknownst to 
		most, all the ghoulies, claw hands and eerie  
		weaponry in creation menaces them from the doors. 


Objectives: 


	#1 -- introduce the various relatives  
	#2 -- establish that all of the visitors are in these  
		rooms 
	#3 -- build suspense and anticipation about the
		upcoming night








Suggestions:

m.  	The important plot/continui

	The important plot/continuity point here is that these are 
		the relatives arriving in response to the lawyer's
		summons of the last scene.
	Could do the "asleep yet?" stuff from Bugs Bunny.  
	Thought it might be fun if, as the Caretaker walks them
		to their rooms, he explains that suites are named 
		after how the last guest in them died.
	This night is a thing to be dreaded.   
	Great time for "dead" jokes.   
	("Dead? I thought she was English!")   


Characters included:
	con man
	The Caretaker  
	teenagers  
	Butlers
	another group  
	yet another group  
	several groups of relatives

Approx. length 10 pages 


Scene sketch:   


	All the guests have fled their rooms and gathered  
		in the drawing room (with Madam)  
	For some reason they hold a seance, led by the 
		mystic relative.  
	Big time scares and special effects, culminating   
		in apparitions and materializations of

Act II general outline  
______________________________________________  


Approx. length 30 pages 


Scene sketch:   




	II:1 The big-time detective(s) arrives by boat at the  
		pier. The guests couldn't summon the police, because  
		they'd have forfeited the estate by leaving for   
		questioning.  


		Detective climbs up ladder to pier with golly-gee 
		sidekick, pushes sidekick off the pier. Sidekick  
		climbs back up soaking wet.   


		Basic objectives to introduce detective and sidekick, 
		explain (to "watson") why a detective has been called.


	II:2 - II:(n-2) Questioning by detective, revelations of   
		a multitude of motives, more murders, more hauntings, 
		and so on 
		Introduce the ghosts of the previous victims of the   
		house, who are frantically trying to tell people things.  


		Kill the ventriloquist with voodoo on his dummy.  


		Discover through some switcheroo that one of the  
		relatives is twins.   




	II:(n-1) Big scene for the detective explaining all sorts  
		of the murders and so on. Lots of cliches. At the end,
		there are still a set of things unexplained.  


		It is revealed that the one th

		It is revealed that the one thing these crimes all
		had in common is that they did not require thumbs.
		The cats did it.  


		The cats, who stood to inherit everything if the  
		relatives all left or died, were behind it all.   
		Thus exposed, the cats (a la CATS!) come out of   
		the woodwork. Lots of cats then do a big production   
		number from Cats!!!!  


	II:n Some sort of reconciliation all around, including 
		the cats, perhaps a discovery that everyone present   
		is a relative after all (including the Butlers),  
		and all sing arm-in-arm about happy endings as they   
		wait for the sunrise that will make them all  
		wealthy.
