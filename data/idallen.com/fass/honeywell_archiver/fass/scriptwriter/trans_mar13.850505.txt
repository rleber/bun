Theme '86: MYSTERIES


-- religious mysteries (how did we get onto this?)  
-- spy stories  
-- explaining the Trinity in 3 acts (how did we get back onto this?)
-- use spies and murderers and other plots to get many groups   
of detectives solving various mysteries and suspecting one another  
of the crimes - overlapping, intersecting crimes
-- detectives trying to kill one another off
-- detectives suspect each other of trying to kill one another off  
-- one detective investigates ALL the other detectives as suspects  
-- charlie chan and his 30 sons all being killed as in D.W.'s great 
"30 ways to kill the guards off" scene  
-- only problem is that once you kill charlie chan's number one 
son, an hour later you want to kill again   

-- nazis taking over the world, and other glorious references to the
entire pulp genre   
-- doc savage   
-- the maltese duck 
-- the maltese generic aquatic bird 
-- friends of mr. disney (what did we mean by this?)
-- how to kill someone (hereinafter abbreviated htks): breathe on them  
-- htks as the PLOT or THEME, giving lessons, like Young Killers of Canada  
-- htks stick their tongue on a super-cooled pipe   
-- htks cover them with eau de chat and put them in a room of ravenous dogs 
-- htks poisoned stamps (when you lick them, you die)   
-- htks put their tongue in the electric pencil sharpener   
-- htks "i dub thee Sir ... " slash slash   
-- htks dropping ceilings, crushing walls   
-- ("squash" court is not for racquet sports!)  
-- htks poison mushrooms
-- htks put someone in a bell jar in water, every step louder (don't
remember how this was done or justified, probably microphones or    
something) and eventually the jar breaks and you drown  
-- htks stake 'em out spreadeagled over Old Faithful
-- htks feed 'em prunes for five days   
-- htks how about setting up a nefarious death trap that
actually works? 
-- how about co-op death trap checkers? 
-- htks radioactive currency!   
-- htks quicksand   
-- htks voodoo dolls (this has theatrical potential, boys and girls!)   
-- htks quicksand in the track and field events at the olympics 
-- hercule poirot   
-- picture a vampire trying to deny his "problem" to detectives,
and explain away constant "vacations" in Transylvania   
(show him garlic bread, try to take his picture, go on a walk   
on a sunny day) 
-- how do detectives make their deductions (reading the script in   
advance, bribing people to admit that they committed the crime just 
the way the detective described it) 
-- detective knows the murderer, crime and motives 'cause he did it 
(murder of roger akroyd, the schtick between holmes and watson in   
Frantics routine)   
-- htks use voodoo-like routine to turn the dorian gray thing around (what  
you do to the portrait happens to him)  
-- htks voodoo is a NICE way to kill (huh?) 
-- htks death rays, the killer sun (i just type 'em folks, i don't  
necessarily understand 'em) 
-- (wait, i do understand it!) great s.f. story where an entire building
is designed with all exterior mirrored windows moveable, and they   ....are focused to concentrate all of the sun on an offi

are focused to concentrate all of the sun on an office opposite, thus   
frying the occupants, with no apparent cause
-- htks read a scroll of genocide   
-- seal a nazi in a room full of cabbage patch kids (what?) 
-- people we want to see "get it": professors, cathy rigby, 
brenda vaccaro, judith christ (?), lucille ball, laverne & shirley, 
rhona barrett, howard cosell, bernadette peters 
-- htks feed them five big macs 
-- people we want to see "get it": the osmonds, the boones, 
barry manilow, trudeau, nebraska (all of it), newark (would 
anyone notice?), mr. bill, sluggo, gumby, mr. hand, twisted 
sister (WE'RE not gonna take it anymore!), bill the cat,
steve dallas
-- seems to me that we got onto this category by discussing 
the idea of replacing either II:3 or the intermission with a
skit in which we killed off all sorts of people in gruesome 
ways, with no reference to the plot, to please the audience 
-- or replace II:3 with people telling elephant jokes   
-- htks smother steve dallas with co-eds
-- invent one (one what? good question!)
-- spy mysteries as opposed to murder mysteries 
-- ripley's believe it or not   
-- after cutting down a crowd in a hail of machine gun fire,

79 people rise to their feet, say "you missed" and beat the 
gunman to death with sticks 
-- people we want to see "get it" (hereinafter abbreviated  
to "get it"): dino de laurentis 
-- someone is killed and EVERYONE confesses (is it orient express   
where everyone did it, at once?)
-- terrorists! (now why didn't we think of that?)   
-- after the detective makes his big revelation, he is shown
to be totally, utterly, embarrassingly WRONG ("but the butler   
DID do it, with this bloodstained machete he's holding over 
the victim even as we watch!")  
-- parody own mystery   
-- metaparody   
-- try the tom stoppard trick of successively shorter versions of   
the same thing (dogg's hamlet)  
-- an evil scientist constructs a machine to turn people into   
young republicans   
-- on the theme of "the butler did it", picture a scene where the   
butler is given credit of everything from the recently pruned tree  
to the pregnancy of the lady of the house, but when it comes to the 
murder, either he didn't, or nobody thinks of it!   
-- a character who changed his name 'cause it used to be Butler 
-- "cherchez la femme" = "keep an eye peeled for broads"
-- "when a man's partner is killed, he's gotta do somethin' about it"   
-- there are mysteries about things other than murder, you know, like   
gem thefts (capers) and political infiltrations (watergate) 
-- clouseau and the pink panther movies 
-- the actual pink panther as a character (the PINK panther)
-- characters who emulate their favourite famous detectives 
-- co-op suspects   
-- "he couldn't have done it, he's on a school term!"   
-- co-op victims: major job qualification is your ability to lie in 
one place for four months   
-- detective holidays and lunch breaks, work-to-rule
-- after a twenty-three-and-a-half hour stakeout, he takes one  
little break, and "it" happens  
-- detectives on strike (easier plot)   
-- let's scare the shit out of the audience

detective)

-- kill a scriptwriter (fine idea! suggestions?)
-- search for the committee killer (who is killing the great
committee members of fass?) 

-- who is killing the great leaders of soviet russia?   
-- sleuth   
-- sleuth (it was so important, i thought i'd say it again) 
-- and then there were none/ten little indians  
-- murder by death  
-- fletch, flynn
-- california dreamin' (song, not murder mystery)   
-- occurs to me as i type this that fletch will be much 
more timely by the time the show comes on, cause the book   
will have been made into the movie with chevy chase by then 
-- black widowers   
-- "get it" the burger king "remember me" kid, then make    
her into burgers
-- "get it" all commercial stars
-- maybe kill those commercial stars in the manner of the   
products they advertise (a la ...great chefs of europe) 
-- "get it" bruce cockburn  
-- dirty harry, theatre of blood, rear window, attack of the
killer tomatoes 
-- what about the bad cult movies that never made it to cult
status, like attack of the killer cantaloupes

-- the thing under the bed/in the closet    
-- psycho, things in the shower 
-- empty, large, cold, dark room/house  
-- attics   
-- black christmas  
-- force 10 gale in a 9 foot dinghy 5 miles from shore

the room just moved 
-- or when you go to put your feet down while swimming, and there's 
no bottom   
-- or opening night 
-- the lights come up onstage, curtain up, a single shot rings out  
and all 80 actors drop dead 
-- (that's a great way to start an opening dance number)

-- (i'm sure i said this later in the session, but just in case:) hold  
a police lineup and pull the suspects from the (real) audience

victim with clear menace, then tickle them

-- omigod helplessness, as in "sorry, wrong number" 
-- wind and branches against the window 
-- sewing scissors  
-- peter demeter (huh?) 
-- children's stories and brothers grimm are actually really nasty little   
tales, with lotsa gruesome stuff

-- someone perhaps named bellhouse locked himself in a room with
a glass of water and a dish of food, and starved to death without

tanks that come alive, vicious killer dolls)

their specialties)

a pattern killer and disguise the motive for the "C" death
