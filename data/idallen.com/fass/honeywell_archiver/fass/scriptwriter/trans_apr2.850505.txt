advice

detectives from all over came here to the house and all bit the big 
one, and now someone has decided to solve the mystery and brings in 
all the new big-time detectives to do it -- if someone kills the
new ones, for instance, all the ghosts can meet 
(whenever two or more of you are gathered in my name ... )
