Theme '86: MYSTERIES


Somehow, after you've already revealed the finished plot outline,   
saving a lot of this stuff seems less relevant, so some editing 
of this material has occurred prior to broadcast.   


-- people who could show up at the house for no reason: avon lady,  
fuller brush salesman, mary kay cosmetics, filter queen, jehovah's  
witnesses, girl guides selling cookies, newspaper boy collecting,   
postman (ring ring - who's that? must be the postman, he always 
rings twice), milk man, meter reader, insurance/encyclopedia salesman,  
kids selling chocalate bars for a band trip, enumerators
-- killed peope with arrow through the head, spiked collapsing bed  
canopy, crushing ("SQUASH ROOM/COURT"), drowning ("POOL HALL"), 
chainsaw, booby-trapped sex aid, poison, explosions 
-- "an axe through your skull can ruin your entire day" 
--Squash court, red room, red rum room, the den (of . . . ?),   
the drawing (and quartering) room   
-- someone disguised as a lamp (the sting scene) has a good idea,   
and the lamp comes on   
-- murder victim is blown away creating a huge wave of blood, and   
the distinctive gap in the pattern of blood on the wall forms   
the silhouette of the witness   
-- maybe harriet's will includes an orphans clause that includes
all of the teenagers?   
-- chalk outlines of victims -- let's use this! 
-- (someone kills the jolly green giant, and we have a giant chalk  
outline of a foot with leaves on it -- there was lots more to this  
great idea) 
-- the board room   
(either hit on the head with a two-by-four, or forced to watch --- re-runs) 
-- "i never saw them before"
-- "the pictures are fakes" 
-- "that's not my signature"
-- "i've never been to schenectady" 
-- codes, passwords, secret messages
-- secret passageways   
-- kill people with cream pies  
-- band of killer clowns, or a killer in a clown suit, and  
no one recognizes him in civvies
-- discover a lost letter, or someone bricked into a wall   
-- diary of a previous victim   
-- clue?
-- i mean the game clue?
-- suspect everyone for a murder that was actually accidental death?
-- remington steele character (again)   
-- clues: hotel register, fingerprints (someone with a feather duster?),
murder weapon, stains, footprints, ladder holes in ground, ring of  
burnt grass in field, beard hair in the sink
-- gypsy named Rair, so we can congratulate them: "well-done, Medium Rair"  
-- alibis: in a different city, on board a plane/train, at party, in jail,  
romantic evening (can't name the other person because of spouse)
-- terrible story, died of a bullet wound! oh, he was shot? no, a 16-ton
carton of bullets fell on him   
-- Miss N. derSchtaanding   
-- using detective(s) to commit a crime by accident in the course of
solving one 
-- ouija board  
-- clear chalk outline on floor of a body in two parts, head in 
one place, torso in another, and serious detective asking coroner   
what he suspects was the cause of death 
-- theatrics: murder onstage, ghosts, hiding, chase scene in  a 
many-doored hallway, mistaken id, pretending to be a mannequin  
-- special effects: gore, lightning, disguise, exploding head,  
techies with glow in the dark shoelaces, exploding follow-spot  
operator, fog horn, air raid siren, gorilla suit, live fire,    
rube goldberg-style murder weapons, student bodies, jacob's ladder  
-- the one-legged tarzan routine
-- embezzlement 
-- woman screaming for the wrong reason 
-- romance between murderer and detective   
-- little shop of horrors   
-- one bad actor doing shakespearian asides that everyone hears 
-- the prompter says "the murderer was . . ."   
-- laugh-in joke wall (using the many-doored corridor?) 
-- wonderful stage directions: "exit pursued by a bear" 
-- monster, #13 
-- cliche number 26 
-- bad luck cliches 
-- convince someone you have a twin brother Rex 
-- someone with a wooden leg switches sides to be twins 
"who did it, long john?" "dunno, it's got me stumped!"  
"pretty limp excuse if you ask me!" "he hasn't got a leg to stand on!"  
-- zombie prod'n nubmer 
-- reincarnation milk   
-- the good news is that there's an afterlife, but the bad news is  
that it's fass  
-- follow the leader/simon says murderer
-- set up a carnie shooting gallery with voodoo dolls   al e-- pictu

-- picture each person as a billiard ball, and call your "shots"
-- most dangerous game: people hung from poles by wrists and ankles 
singing "always look on the bright side of life", people wearing
antlers ("he said it was a stag party" "aren't we joining the elks?")   
-- try to convince an amnesiac he did it
-- cut to prison/asylum for closing number (jailhouse rock?)
-- a professor comes in and, from habit, erases the chalk outline   
-- the chevron's back and you're gonna be sorry, hey nonny non  
-- old nanny constantly knitting (maybe dead harriet could be knitting, 
and every scene the scarf is longer)
-- using the 10 little indians gimmick, singing 99 bottles of beer  
-- barred room, mysterious trunk that's never opened
-- "bed and breakfast?" "bed. you get breakfast as a prize for  
surviving the night!"   
-- rigid suits instead of suits of armour on display
-- "if you want anything, just scream!" 
-- con the egotistical detectives and make fools of them to discredit them  
-- "the murderer is . . . CP DISCONNECTS"   
-- put a list of cliches in the program and challenge the audience to   
spot them and tick them off, but use each of the cliches in a new   
and different context   

-- run a railway out the vom and lash a hapless damsel to the tracks
-- steamer trunk with a body in it  
-- mixed up luggage, and "yours" has a big red pool under it
-- SAMSONite luggage (cut its hair and it falls apart)  
-- ellery queen challenge   
-- escalating weaponry! 
-- are there ghost detectives like there are ghost writers? 
-- can we write in a liverpudlian cameo for kendrick?   
-- actual skeleton in closet
-- this is the night we thought of an actual pier!  
-- invasion of the yuppie snatchers 
-- someone dies on a blackboard so they're easy to outline  
-- make it really obvious who the murderer is (taxidermist) 
-- audience a jury, some subset of audience a jury  
-- Christopher Colombo (maybe he's the detective on the pier)   
-- objects hidden inside objects
--	99 bodies are dead on the stage  
	99 bodies are dead 
	if one of those bodies should still be alive   
	98 bodies are dead on the stage . . .  


--	Consider yourself a corpse   
	consider yourself one of the deep-sixed ones   
	we've taken to you so strong   
	it's clear we're here  
	but you're not going to breathe too long   
	we don't know how you'll die   
	it's going to be   t co	very me

	very messily . . . 


--	Who put the corpse in the cafeteria? 
	who slipped the shiv in the middle of his kidneys? 
	...
	...
	Who was that guy who made sure Magnus died?	   
	I'd like to know because they think it's me!   
	(constables hum in background as suspects say:)
	richard: Yes, inspector, i stood to inherit six million
	dollars if magnus muldoon died of external hemmorhaging
	in a public dining hall, but so did the rest --
	sandra: yes, magnus was having an affair and i hated   
	him for it. but what about beth?   
	beth: yes i loved him, and i hated him because he  
	wouldn't leave her 
	don: and he wouldn't give me a raise and he treated me 
	like dirt! 
	jack: magnus muldoon once cheated me out of a business 
	takeover   
	inspector: what about you? 
	stan: well i just met him but i didn't like him much
