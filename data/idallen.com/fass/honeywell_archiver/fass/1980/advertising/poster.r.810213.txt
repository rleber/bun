FASS - Calling All Graphicists  
.sp 3   
.ti 8   
Here's your chance to get your work admired all over campus!
FASS, our annual comedy show, is looking for a graphic for the  
major poster for our 1980 show.  We would like anyone who is
interested to submit a poster design sketch on or before Monday, Dec 3  
to Ron Dragushan (on-campus mail to C&O Dept, M&C Building).
We will be choosing one poster to be reproduced in good copy by Wed, Dec 12.

Very briefly, the theme of this year's show is the humorous side of continued   
money difficulties for U of W by sometime around the year 1985. 
We see that the various factions of the university (Physical Resources Group,   
Administration, Students, and more!) are plotting nefarious schemes to save 
the university from going under.  Enter some aliens from another planet,
not to mention a mind-blowing secret weapon discovered by a lowly   
(but loved) grad student, and you have more than enough plot complications  
to support our usual variety of jokes and comic situations. 
The name of the show will be "Days of Future FASS". 



As well as the name, the poster should contain the word FASS, which we would
like to be the most visible word on the poster.  The show runs from 
Wednesday, February 6 to Saturday, February 9 with the following show times 
and prices:
