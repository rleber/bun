Yes, Fass has finally arrived!  In just a few more days, the funniest   
show on campus will hit the stage -- and what a show it will be!
.sp .5

As you may already know, the theme for this year's show is "Spies and Spying",  
but there's lots more to it than that.  There are bumbling insurance agents,
some dancing robots,
a high-powered research team, a feeble-minded company president,
some co-op students, a seductress or two,   
and lots of little elves.

(that's right, elves!)

The plot is kind of complicated (sometimes we don't understand it all ourselves),   
but it centers around stealing secret plans from other countries.  Along the way
we manage to visit the North Pole (by submarine, no less!), 
and save the world. 
(and that's just in one act!)

Fass comes but once a year, and we've been at it since 1963.  (Ah, the good old 
days).  The show is singing, dancing, acting, clever puns, rotten jokes, and

the occasional lighted-hearted jab or two at the pleasures and perils of life   
at Waterloo.

In the past, we've spoofed gangsters ("The St. Valentine's Day FASSacre"),  
ocean adventures ("Ships that FASS in the Night"),  
and life in the not-too-distant future ("Days of Future FASS"). 
Every year, dozens of outgoing and fun-loving would-be actors, singers and dancers  
get together to put on a show that brings Waterloo to its knees with laughter and   
to its feet in adulation.   
(forgive our immodesty!)

This year it's "FASSified Information", and it's for your eyes only!  (Feel free
to bring along any warm and breathing bodies, though -- the more the merrier!)

If you don't think there's a lighter side to undercover work, then FASS '81 
is a must-see.  
From debonair cloak-and-dagger types to devious and delectable temptresses, 
from Dinah Might to Yves Dropping,  
from Major Breakthrough to General Degree,  
from the R.C.M.P. to the agents of N.A.S.T.Y, we have them all! 
.sp .5

The show is put on by the Faculty, Administration, Staff, and Students of the   

















University, so you're bound to see some familiar faces on stage.  That's part   
of the fun -- seeing friends and loved ones up on stage, delivering some of the 
best (and worst!) one-liners you've ever heard.

Not only is the show performed by University talent, it's also written by a 
fun-loving group of rowdies right here on Campus, giving it a distinctly
UW feel.  If there's a major institution at this University that we don't poke  
fun at, we'd sure like to know about it!

Above all else, Fass is 
\\FiFUN!\FR 
Fun for the actors, fun for the techies, and most   
of all it's fun for you, the audience.  You're the ones we put the show together
for, and you're the ones who see it.  (Sort of makes sense, doesn't it?)

The tickets for this year's show are going well, so get them while you can! 
The friday and saturday shows traditionally go FASSt, and this year seems to
be no exception.  The friday late show is almost sold out, and the early show   
is picking up too.  You can get your tickets by going to the Box Office in  
The Humanities Building (also called Hagey Hall, just to confuse people).  If   











you're lost, call extension 2126 and ask for directions.

The show will be put on the 4, 5, 6 and 7th of February (wednesday through  
saturday), at 8:00 pm (except friday, which has one show at seven and a late
show at 10:00).

See you there!
