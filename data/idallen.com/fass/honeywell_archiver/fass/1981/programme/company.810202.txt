.HH "The FASS Company"  
.fi 
We are Faculty, Administration, Staff, and Students,
and this year there are over a hundred of us.   
Last year, many of us sat right where you are tonight   
and wondered how we could become part of an annual musical  
comedy, now in its ninteenth year,  
poking fun at life here at UW.  
We heard that \fBFASS\fP was a collection of fun-loving amateur 
acting and backstage persons specializing in creating new friendships   
while writing and staging a farcical, dramatic, satiric, musical comedy 
the first week of every February.

Now it is \fIour\fP turn to invite you to join \fIus\fP!
We are an independent, self-supporting group;   
profits from ticket sales finance next February's show as well  
as providing equipment for the Theatres.
Becoming part of \fBFASS\fP is as easy as attending the annual  
general meeting in September, or auditions in January, or   
scriptwriter meetings anytime!  
Watch for \fBFASS\fP posters!!
