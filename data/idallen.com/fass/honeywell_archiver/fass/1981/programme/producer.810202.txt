Well, here we all are again \- another year, another \fBFASS\fP.
Corny as it sounds, I really would like to thank all the people 
who've helped make this show happen; most of them are mentioned 
in this program (and gravest apologies to those who were overlooked,
misspelled or otherwise mistreated).
The only people who 
\fIaren't\fP mentioned herein are actually the most important people of 
all \- you, the audience.   
When you come right down to it, you're the ones we go throught this 
yearly madness for; you're the ones who make all the time and   
sweat (and blood, and tears, and whatnot) worth it. 
(Of course there
\fIare\fP the cast parties, but we won't mention those).
.ti +0.5i   
If you like the show (and we hope you will) please let us know, 
with your laughter and applause.
The response we get from you
is what keeps us going \- it's what an actor (or singer, or 
dancer) lives and breathes for, and if you let us know you're   
having a good time it will give us the energy to do even better.

A final word, to those adventurous souls who are thinking ``gosh,   
that looks like fun \- I wonder if I should give it a try next  
year?''.
The word is \fBdo it\fP! The word is \fBjump right in\fP! The word  
is \fBwelcome aboard\fP! The word is that we need writers and actors
and singers and dancers and crazy, outgoing, fun people next year, as we do every year. 
If you've half a mind to get involved, that's enough (a lot of this 
year's cast is getting by on a lot less than that!) 
.ti +0.5i   
That's all I've got to say. 
Enjoy the show, have fun, react.
And 
when 1982 rolls around, become part of the funniest, zaniest, most  
entertaining show on campus \- \fBFASS\fP.
