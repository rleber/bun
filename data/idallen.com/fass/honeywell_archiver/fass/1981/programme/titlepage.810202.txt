\fIWarning:\fP This show meets and exceeds the CRTC ruling regarding
Canadian content.   
Nevertheless we must caution you that, despite occasional lapses into   
Canajan,
it is only available in English, or a reasonable approximation thereto. 
Language translators may be obtained after the show if you know what brand  
of beer they like.  
.sp 
\fICaveat:\fP   
The characters and events portrayed in this show are purely 
ficticious, and bear no resemblance to real people or places
whether living or dead, no matter how hard we tried to make them so.
In particular,  
there is no Vice-President of the U.S.A. named Bush,
Brian McFarlane and Bill Hewitt do not announce the play-by-plays   
for Hockey Night in Canada, 
and Irv Weinstein and Tom Jolls do not appear on the Channel Seven  
Eyewitness News no matter how many fires there are in North Tonnawanda. 
So there.   
.sp 
\fIIntermissions:\fP
There will be an intermission after the play which will last as long as 
you want it to. 
There might be one during the play if the stage manager remembers it.   
If there is, we must ask that   
you not throw sacrifices into the moat around the stage.
.sp 
\fINotice:\fP   
You can't smoke in the theatre or gallery because the fire marshal  
doesn't want to be responsible if you get lung cancer.  
You can't eat or drink refreshments in the theatre or gallery   
because the theatre management does not want to contribute to   
anyone's obesity.   
You won't be allowed to use cameras during the performance because  
one of the soldiers is trigger-happy and shoots anything that flashes.  
You can't use your tape recorder either;
the script is copyrighted by the people \fIwe\fP stole it from. 
Thank you for observing these rules.
Violators will be dressed as a particularly 
odius species of worm and thrown mercilessly into the moat  
during intermission.
.sp 
\fIRating:\fP   
This show has been refused an \fBR\fP rating by the censors 
\fI(maybe they haven't seen it yet)\fP, 
and is currently rated \fBI\fP: 
\fIfor immature audiences only.\fP
