.HH "Intermissions: How to Use Them"
.fi 
If we do remember to have an intermission,  
this is where it should be. 
If you absolutely \fIhave\fP to leave the theatre before this time, 
please raise your hand so that our spotlight operator can pick you out  
more easily.
(p.s. We know where \fIyou're\fP going...)

At this time
Andrew may decide to play some piano, not because he likes you but  
because he likes the piano. 
While he is playing,
please keep your canoes out of the moat.
Thank you.
