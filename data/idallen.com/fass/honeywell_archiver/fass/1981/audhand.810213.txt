F.A.S.S. is an acronym for Faculty, Administration, Staff and Students. 
If you fit into one of these catagories then you are already a  
member of FASS! These auditions help to turn latent FASSers into
full-fledged FASSers.

Although you may not have heard of us before, FASS is a year-round  
organization. FASS puts on a yearly, non-professional, musical satire   
which usually deals with (no matter how vaguely) things that happen 
here at UW. The auditions are in January and the play is performed  
early in February. This is not, however, all that FASS is.  
FASS is one of the most gregarious groups on campus.
We have parties all year-round. 
(Is FASS
.bf 
REALLY  
just an excuse to have parties?)
In the winter, after the show, there is a general meeting for all   
FASS members to choose the people who will run the next year's show.
In the summer we generally have a campout. In the fall we write 





the show for the following winter.  
We need both your local address (for now) and your permanent address
(for later). Please keep us informed of any address changes.

What happens now? Once auditions are over, Ian Chaprin (this year's 
Director) will spend the weekend mulling over his notes.
By Monday, January 12th, 1981 a casting list will be posted 
inside the Stage Door of the Theatre of the Arts.   
Monday night is the first read-through of the play and we are immediately   
into madly rehearsing, madly building sets and madly partying.  
The show goes on February 4 through 7,  
so everyone must be prepared to devote a certain amount of their
time.   
If you have anything larger than a cameo
appearance be prepared to devote several hours out of 90% of
your evenings from now until February 7th (the night of the last performance).  
If you accept a part, acting or technical, and then later   
find that you can't do it (time restrictions, etc.) then LET US KNOW.   
Think of the person who has to pick up where you left off!  
FASS is a volunteer effort, but we run on a very tight schedule.
