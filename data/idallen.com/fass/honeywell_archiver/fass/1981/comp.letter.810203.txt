Greetings!  
.ti +5  
We realize this is extremely short notice, but enclosed 
please find two complementary tickets to FASS '81.  If you do   
get a chance to see the show, please tell all your friends about
us, and encourage them to come see the show.

Our ticket sales have been going extremely well so far, and 
there are still a few left for the friday EARLY show.  If   
you think friends of yours would enjoy the show, let them know  
that they should go to the Box Office (in Hagey Hall of the Humanities) 
or call extension 2126.

Many thanks, and I hope you enjoy the show.
