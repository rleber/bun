     Good  News!  The  show pictures are in the office. If you want to pick 
yours up you can contact me (Alex) and I can meet you on campus. If you are 
not  on  campus  this  summer then you can get them at the F.A.S.S. Weekend 
(more about that later). If you won't be able to be at the  Summer  Weekend 
we will try to get them to you some other way.  


--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


Non-F.A.S.S. News:  


     Frisbee  is  "happening"  during lunch hours on random days (depending 


















on weather etc.) If you are around and want an excuse to play outside  call 
Ian!  Allen  at  885-1211 ext. 6545 or drop by his office (MC 3045) to find 
out details.


     Theatresports started for the summer on Saturday May  9  and  will  be 
happening  every  other Saturday thereafter. Locations vary so either check 
the Imprint or call Bernie Roehl at 745-4419. The Theatresports Weekend  is 
set for Brantford on May 29,30 and 31. Bernie can fill in the details.

     The  Upstage Productions branch of the Creative Arts Board in associa- 
tion with the Federation of Students is pleased to present the soon  to  be 
smash comedy revue...   


                  Honest Fed's Discount Comedy Warehouse


The show is happening -- June 23, 24, 25 (That's Tues. Wed. Thurs.) 
     at 8:30 p.m. in Fed Hall.  So if you're in the neighbourhood  drop  in 
and  see  the  show  (tickets  will  be available at the Fed Office and Fed 
Hall).  If you're going to be around come on out and  tech and, well,  just 
be a part of it.


     Playreadings  are happening on Monday nights starting Monday May 25 in 



CC 138B from 8 to 11 p.m. We are ostensibly reading plays to pick  one  for 
the  Fall term but we are also having loads of fun! So come on out, bring a 
play if you'd like or just drop by - we always have lots of plays to choose 
from.  Times  and  locations  may  change  so  call  me (Alex) for frequent 
updates.

     Hi.  My name is Dave Till, and my job is Script Manager for FASS  '88. 
What you are about to read is a blatent sales pitch, so brace yourselves.   
     Are you going to be on or near campus in the summer and/or fall?   Can 
you construct a reasonably coherent English sentence?  Do you like to laugh 
and make others laugh?  Have you nothing to do on Wednesday  and/or  Sunday 
nights? 
     If the answer to any or all  of  these  questions  is  "yes"  or  even 
"maybe",  then you are qualified, possibly overqualified, to help write the 
script for next year's show.  We need  people  to  write,  generate  ideas, 
provide constructive criticism, produce intricate works of origami form old 
computer printouts and look decorative.  No experience is necessary.











     Writer's  meetings  for  FASS  `88  will  be  held  at 7:00 p.m. every 
Wednesday and Sunday night throughout the summer and  fall  terms  starting 
May  6.   Most  meetings  will be held in the Math and Computer building in 
Room 5158; check out the posters on the FASS bulletin boards in the  Campus 
Centre  and  South  Campus Hall for details.  This year's theme is love and 
romance, and I hope to see you there!   


--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


     Hi!  As producer of FASS this year the only thing I  have  to  say  is 
that  it's  going to be a great year.  We've got lots of events planned and 
room for many more.  We really need help  though.   If  you're  interested, 
drop me a line with your name, address and a phone number where I can reach 
you; c/o The FASS Theatre Company, HH 177A,  University  of  Waterloo,  N2L 
3G1.
     If you like to draw, you might be  interested  in  our  poster  design 
contest  in  the  fall.   Details  will  be available at the organizational 
meeting in September.  Not going to be here next fall?  No  problem!   Just 
send  me  your  name  and  address and I'll send you the contest details by 


mail.  Prizes will be awarded for this contest. 
     Hope to hear from you and see you next FASS!!  Lise Fortin

     If  you  ignore  everything  else in this newsletter, (and I certainly 
hope you don't), at least reserve the following days on your calendar  NOW: 
July  10,  11,  12.   These  are  the  dates for the fun-filled FASS Summer 
Weekend, held this year at that venerable FASS Weekend location,  Elizabeth 
and Peter Fraser's farm.  (A map to said place is attached.)  For those new 
to this camping extravaganza, I shall explain what it's all about.  
     Many  people  start  arriving  after  6:00 p.m. on the Friday evening, 
while those who can't get away  that  early  show  up  some  time  Saturday 
morning.   Generally everybody stays till late Sunday afternoon.  Why, even 
those who can't stay out drive out during the daytime Saturday and  Sunday, 
seeing as it's only a 20 MINUTE drive from the university.  


                     *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *  




















     If  you  can't make the whole weekend, at least be sure to show up for 
Saturday afternoon by 12:00 noon at the very latest.   FASS  is  holding  a 
combination  car  rally/scavenger hunt/track and field event which you will 
not want to miss.  Our guinea pig ralliers  have  already  given  it  their 
stamp of approval.  Team PRIZES will be awarded!


                     *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *  


     If you are not a bear, and consequently do not wish to subsist on nuts 
and berries, you have two choices about food:  bring your own  and  prepare 
it  yourself, or take part in the grand FASS nutrient pool!  What does this 
entail?  You will be provided with the following three meals:   


     - Saturday and Sunday brunches (varied menus, including Suzanne's Hai- 
       tian French Toast!)  


     - Saturday dinner (a barbecue bonanza, with some of that lovely garlic 
       sausage from the market, and Rachel's heavenly hamburger recipe!)


       (Necessary eating equipment will also be on hand - er, in hand.) 


     If you wish to take part in the food  pool,  you  can  save  money  by 
















sending  a  cheque for $10 per person NOW, with no interest until 1988.  If 
you pay upon arrival, the price will be $15 per person.   So  please,  make 
your  cheque  out  to  the  F.A.S.S.  Theatre  Company, and mail it and the 
attached registration form to the following address:


          Brian Martin  
          Apt. # 703
          285 Erb St. W.
          Waterloo, Ontario 
          N2L 1W5

          WHAT YOU SHOULD BRING:


Camping Stuff:  tents,   sleeping   bags,   pillows,   lamps,  flashlights, 
                sunscreen, bug lotion, warm  clothes,  rain  gear  (yuch!), 
                lawn chairs, etc.   


Fun Stuff:  swimsuits, towels (they have a POOL), frisbees, kites, baseball 
            gear, telescopes, games, musical instruments & music  (for  the 
            CAMPFIRE), etc. 


Refreshment Stuff:  booze,  coolers,  &  any  food and equipment which FASS 
                    will not be providing   


NOTE:  Munchies will be available free to everyone  in  the  evenings,  and 
















       pop/juice will be available all weekend at a subsidized cost 


Rally Stuff:  A  full tank of gas, and a desire to have at least five and a 
              half good times   


     If ANYONE has any form of barbecue/camp stove they could bring, please 
phone me at 519-888-6525.   
     If you have no way of getting yourself out to the  Frasers',  ask  any 
FASS  members  you run into.  Car spaces are generally in plentiful supply. 
If you are really stuck, or have any  other  questions  or  suggestions  to 
direct my way, my number again is 519-888-6525. 
     Speaking of other FASS members, spread the word to them in  case  they 
haven't received this newsletter.  We want everyone to be there!
     Whether you are sending a cheque or not, I'd really appreciate if  you 
could  get  your  responses to the registration form below to me, either by 
mail, phone, or by electronic mail to bgmartin@watyew via the NET.  


                              Thank You!
                                  Brian Martin, Vice-President
