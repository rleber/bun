Just remember that you're standing  
On a campus that's expanding
And is growing by a building every year.
It's second home to 13,000 scholars and their dollars   
Mostly go towards the purchasing of beer.   
The profs and you and me
And all the students you can see
Voted me to get a pub without a catch.  
But with the plans selected 
Adding doors had been neglected,
And so the architects must start from scratch.

The hall is nicer yet   
Than the 'Loo or Coronet
And certainly less tacky than the Kent  
For dancing space the hall  
Will make the Motor Inn look small  
And best of all we will not pay a cent of rent. 
The area was scanned
To find the perfect piece of land;  
I suggested north of U. of Waterloo.
But then Administration 
Built a rink on my location.
Surprise, surprise - you pay for that one too.

Your Federation Hall
Will be completed in the fall,  
That's September 7th, 1994. 
Let me make all decisions,  
Choose the architect's revisions.   
The budget's set, we can't afford the floor.
The students will adore it  
You've already voted for it 
You support it but the soil structure won't.
And so your mezzanine   
Will be the best you've ever seen,  
Or maybe not, well now you see it, now you don't.

You bow your head   
And hope the quiz will only be "short answer"   
But to your dread   
You find the prof has proved that he is slime   
It's essay time!
.ve 6   
  And it's a killer midterm test
  Your lack of useful knowledge 
  Fills your heart with grim dismay 

  And it's not even multiple guess  
  You're really up the creek
  Upon the killer midterm today.
.ve 5   
    Eight questions waiting 
    On subjects you haven't a clue about
    No way of faking
    The facts a response should include 
    You are right royally screwed.  
.ve 9   
But pick a question 
One that seems a little less obscure
Fight your depression   
Dig right in, start shovellin' manure   
There's one slim hope   
To salvage partial marks from this disaster 
Don't groan and mope
Your grade may not turn out to be that bad  
If you can pad  
.ve 7   
  So write some filler, filler now  
  A flood of purple prose might fool
  An overworked T.A.
  Just be a filler spiller now  
  Perhaps you'll save your tush 
  Churn out some killer diller midterm filler   
  Here today!   
.ve 6   
  Keep spouting filler, never rest  
  And don't forget your Webster's   
  Or your Bartlett's or Roget   
  'Cause it's a killer diller test  
  Your ass is in a sling
  And it's a killer midterm...

MASTER: 
  Darkness falls across the land
  The witching hour is close at hand
  Heavens split in mortal fear  
  As the summoning draws near.  
.ve 4   
  And whomsoever shall be found 
  Upon the Jekyll's curs-ed ground  
  Must stand and face a fiend from hell 
  And die like any infidel. 
.ve 4   
  For deep beneath this rotting soil
  Enfettered in a magic coil
  There lurks a force of rav'nous doom  
  Imprisoned in a ghastly tomb. 
.ve 4   
  Now by the power of evil hand,
  By gifts of incense, fire, and blood  
  I break the chains with one command   
  Demonus Vene, Beelzebub!

.sb "THAT WAS THE PLAY" "THOSE WERE THE DAYS"   
We started with a mansion in the country,   
To which some frightened teen-agers did run.
We added in some loud obnoxious tourists,   
And spying Russians just to have more fun.

After that things start to get confusing,   
As crooks and family and cultists mix.  
All out to get a rich old lady's fortune
Using a variety of tricks.  
.ve 5   
Then the detectives came,   
But they all fared the same,
Ran here and there and wasted all their time.   
They had no chance really to solve the mystery. 
They did their best but could not solve the crime.

That was the play my friend, we're sad it had to end.   , Be

We sang and danced from dusk to break of day.   
We did our best for you, and we enjoyed it too. 
That was the play, oh yes, that was the play.   
.ve 4   
Now it's time to take off all our make-up.  
We'll hang our costumes on the racks and then,  
We'll strike the sets and head off to the party,
And sing all of our favourite songs again.  
.ve 4   
If you're depressed because the play is over,   
Raise up your head and wipe away that tear. 
Make plans to come to FASS in Eighty-seven. 
We reach a quarter century next year.   
.ve 4   
That was the play, adieu.   
We'll take our leave of you.
But we'll be back, along with all the jokes.
It's been a slice you know, 
Hope you enjoyed the show.  
That was the play, oh yes that was the play.
