                  A Hard Day's Night


It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log 
But when I get home to you  
I find the things that you do   
Will make me feel all right.


You know I work all day 
To get you money to buy you things  
And it's worth it just to hear you say  
You're gonna give me everything 
So why on earth should I moan   
Cause when I get you alone  
You know I feel okay.   


When I'm home, everything seems to be right 
When I'm home, feeling you holding me tight 
Tight, yeah.


(& 1ST VERSE)   


You know I feel all right   
You know I feel all right.  


.   
                  All My Loving 


Close your eyes and I'll kiss you   
Tomorrow I'll miss you  
Remember I'll always be true
And then while I'm away 
I'll write home every day   
And I'll send all my loving to you. 


CHORUS:  All my loving, I will send to you  
All my loving, darling, I'll be true.   


I'll pretend that I'm kissing   

The lips I am missing   
And hope that my dreams will come true  
And then while I'm away 
I'll write home every day   
And I'll send all my loving to you. 


(& CHORUS)  


All my loving, all my loving, ooh   
All my loving, I will send to you.

                  American Pie  
    
A long long time ago
I can still remember how that music used to make me smile   
And I knew if I had my chance, that I could make those people dance 
And maybe they'd be happy for a while   
But February made me shiver, with every paper I'd deliver   
Bad news on the doorstep - I couldn't take one more step
I can't remember if I cried when I read about his widowed bride 
But something touched me deep inside the day the music died.
    
CHORUS:  Bye-bye, Miss American Pie 
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry   
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die, this'll be the day that I die.   
(They were singin') 
    
Did you write the book of love and do you have faith in God above   
If the Bible tells you so?  
Now do you believe in rock and roll, can music save your mortal soul
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?
Well I know that you're in love with him cause I saw you dancin' in the gym 
You both kicked off your shoes, Man, I dig those rhythm and blues   
I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck, with a pink carnation and a pick-up truck 
But I knew I was out of luck the day the music died, I started singin'  
    
(& CHORUS)  
    
Now for ten years we've been on our own, and moss grows fat on a rollin' stone  
But that's not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the king and queen, in a coat he borrowed from James Dean  
And a voice that came from you and me   
Oh and while the king was lookin' down, the jester stole his thorny crown   
The courtroom was adjourned, no verdict was returned
And while Lenin read a book on Marx, the quartet practiced in the park  
And we sang dirges in the dark the day the music died, we were singin'  
    
(& CHORUS)  
    
Helter-skelter in the summer swelter, the birds flew off the fallout shelter
Eight miles high and fallin' fast   
It landed foul on the grass, the players tried for a forward pass   
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast  
Now the half-time air was sweet perfume, while the sergeants played a marching tune 
We all got up to dance but we never got the chance  
Cause the players tried to take the field, the marching band refused to yield   
Do you recall what was revealed the day the music died, we started singin'  


(& CHORUS)  


And there we were all in one place, a generation lost in space  
With no time left to start again
So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick, Jack Flash sat on a candlestick   
Cause fire is the devil's only friend   
And as I watched him on the stage, my hands were clenched in fists of rage  
No angel born in hell could break that Satan's spell
And as the flame climbed high into the night, to light the sacrificial rite 
I saw Satan laughing with delight the day the music died, he was singin'


(& CHORUS)  


I met a girl who sang the blues and I asked her for some happy news 
But she just smiled and turned away 
I went down to the sacred store where I'd heard the music years before  
But the man there said the music wouldn't play  
And in the streets the children screamed, the lovers cried and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken, the church bells all were broken 
And the three men I admire most, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast the day the music died, and they were singin'  


(& CHORUS x 2)  


.   
                  And I Love Her


I give her all my love  
That's all I do 
And if you saw my love  
You'd love her too, I love her. 


She gives me everything 
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me, and I love her.   


A love like ours, could never die   
As long as I have her near me.  


Bright are the stars that shine 
Dark is the sky 
I know this love of mine
Will never die, and I love her. 


.   
                  Annie's Song  


You fill up my senses like a night in the forest
Like the mountains in springtime
Like a walk in the rain 
Like a storm in the desert  
Like a sleepy blue ocean
You fill up my senses   
Come fill me again. 


Come let me love you, let me give my life to you
Let me drown in your laughter   
Let me die in your arms 
Let me lay down beside you  
Let me always be with you   
Come let me love you
Come love me again. 


.   
                  Away With Rum 


We're coming, we're coming, our brave little band   
On the right side of temp'rance we now take our stand   
We don't use tobacco because we do think
That the people who use it are likely to drink! 


CHORUS:  Away, away, with rum by gum, with rum by gum, with rum by gum  
Away, away, with rum by gum, the song of the Salvation Army.


We never eat cookies because they have yeast    
And one little bite makes a man like a beast
Oh can you imagine a sadder disgrace
Than a man in the gutter with crumbs on his face.   


(& CHORUS)  


We never eat fruitcake because it has rum   
And one little slice puts a man on the bum  
Oh can you imagine a sorrier sight  
Than a man eating fruitcake until he gets tight.


(& CHORUS)  


When you go out dining you're tempted to eat
All the delicacies on a menu elite  
Remember this warning, on wine we've a ban  
Try spaghetti and meatballs and not cog au vin. 


(& CHORUS)  


We don't allow backrubs, we think they're a crime   
We will always condemn them in song and in rhyme
An alcohol backrub is worse than straight gin   
When you think of the liquor absorbed through your skin.


(& CHORUS)

                  Baby Driver   


My daddy was a family bassman   
My mama was an engineer 
And I was born one dark grey morn   
With music playin' in my ears, in my ears.  


CHORUS:  They call me Baby Driver   
And once upon a pair of wheels  
Hit the road and I'm gone, ah   
What's my number, I wonder how your engine feels
Ba-ba-ba-ba 
Scoot down the road, what's my number?  
I wonder how your engine feels. 


My daddy was a prominent frogman
My mama's in the naval reserve  
When I was young I carried a gun
But I never got the chance to serve, I did not serve.   


(& CHORUS)  


My daddy got a big promotion
My mama got a raise in pay  
There's no-one home, we're all alone
Oh come into my room and play, yes, we can play.


I'm not talkin' 'bout your pigtails 
But talkin' 'bout your sex appeal   
Hit the road and I'm gone...

                  Bad, Bad Leroy Brown  


Well, the Southside of Chicago  
Is the baddest part of town 
And if you go down there, you just better beware
Of a man, name of Leroy Brown   
Now Leroy, more than trouble
You see he stand about 6 foot 4 
All the downtown ladies call him "treetop lover"
All men just call him "sir".


Now Leroy, he a gambler 
And he like his fancy clothes   
And he like to wave his diamond ring
In front of everybody's nose
He got a custom Continental 
He got an Eldorado too  
He got a thirty-two gun in his pocket for fun   
He got a razor in his shoe. 


CHORUS:  And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown  
The baddest man in the whole damned town
Badder than old King Kong   
And meaner than a junkyard dog. 


Well Friday, 'bout a week ago   
Leroy shootin' dice 
And at the edge of the bar sat a girl name of Doris 
And oh, that girl looked nice   
Well, he cast his eyes upon her 
And the trouble soon began  
And Leroy Brown, he learned a lesson 'bout messin'  
With the wife of a jealous man. 


(& CHORUS)  


Well, the two men took to fightin'  
And when they pulled him from the floor 
Leroy looked like a jigsaw puzzle   
With a couple of pieces gone.   


(& CHORUS)  

ComeYes, you were badder than old King K

Yes, you were badder than old King Kong 
And meaner than a junkyard dog. 


.   
                  Best Of My Love   


Every night I'm lying in bed
Holding you close in my dreams  
Thinking about all the things that you said 
And coming apart at the seams   
We try to talk it over  
But the words come out too rough
I know you were trying      
To give me the best of your love.   


Beautiful faces, and wide empty spaces  
Look at the way that we live
Wasting our time on cheap talk and wine 
Left us so little to give   
That same old crowd was like a cold dark cloud  
That we could never rise above  
But here in my heart    
I give you the best of my love. 


CHORUS:  Oh, sweet darling  
You get the best of my love. (x 2)  


I'm going back in time and it's a sweet dream   
It was a quiet night and I would be all right   
If I could go on sleeping.  


But every morning I wake up and worry   
 What's gonna happen today  
You see it your way and I see it mine   
And we both see it slippin' away
You know we always had each other babe  
I guess that wasn't enough  
But her in my heart 
I give you the best of my love. 



(& CHORUS)  


.   
                  Bitter Green  


Upon the bitter green she walked
The hills above the town
Echoed to her footsteps 
As soft as eiderdown
Waiting for her master  
To kiss away her tears  
Waiting through the years.  


CHORUS:  Bitter Green, they called her, walking in the sun  
Loving everyone that she met
Bitter Green, they called her, waiting in the sun   
Waiting for someone to take her home.   


Some say he was a sailor
Who died away at sea
Some say he was a prisoner  
Who never was set free  
Lost upon the ocean 
He died there in the mist   
Dreaming of a kiss. 


(& CHORUS)  


But now the bitter green is gone
The hills have turned to rust   
There comes a weary stranger
His tears fall in the dust  
Kneeling by the churchyard  
In the autumn mist  
Dreaming of a kiss. 


(& CHORUS)  


.   
                  Black And White   


The ink is black, the page is white 
Together we learn to read and write 
A child is black, a child is white  
The whole world looks upon the sight, a beautiful sight.


And now a child can understand  
That this is the law of all the land, all the land. 


The world is black, the world is white  
It turns by day, and then by night  
A child is black, a child is white  
Together they grow to see the light, to see the light.  


And now at last we plainly see  
We'll have a dance of liberty, liberty. 


(& 2ND VERSE)   


.   
                  Blowing in the Wind   


How many roads must a man walk down, before you call him a man? 
How many seas must a white dove sail, before she sleeps on the sand?
How many times must a cannonball fly, before they're forever banned?


CHORUS:  The answer my friend, is blowin' in the wind   
The answer is blowin' in the wind.  


How many years can a mountain exist, before it is washed to the sea?
How many years can some people exist, before they're allowed to be free?
How many times can a man turn his head, pretending he just doesn't see? 


(& CHORUS)  


How many times must a man look up, before he can see the sky?   
How many ears must one man have, before he can hear people cry? 
How many deaths will it take till he knows, that too many people have died?

                  Both Sides Now


Bows and flows of angel hair, and ice cream castles in the air  
And feather canyons everywhere, I've looked at clouds that way  
But now they only block the sun, they rain and snow on everyone 
So many things I would have done, but clouds got in my way  
I've looked at clouds from both sides now   
From up and down and still somehow  
It's clouds' illusions I recall 
I really don't know clouds at all.  


Moons and Junes and ferris wheels, the dizzy dancing way you feel   
As every fairy tale comes real, I've looked at love that way
But now it's just another show, you leave them laughing when you go 
And if you care, don't let them know, don't give yourself away  
I've looked at love from both sides now 
From give and take, and still somehow   
It's love's illusions I recall  
I really don't know love at all.


Tears and fears and feeling proud, to say 'I love you' right out loud   
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds, I've looked at life that way  
But now old friends are acting strange, they shake their heads, they say I've changed   
But something's lost, but something's gained in living everyday 

..o..I..

I've looked at life from both sides now 
From win and lose and still somehow 
It's life's illusions I recall  
I really don't know life at all.

                  Bridge Over Troubled Water


When you're weary, feelin' small
When tears are in your eyes 
I'll dry them all   
I'm on your side, oh, when times get rough  
And friends just can't be found.


CHORUS:  Like a bridge over troubled water  
I will lay me down  
Like a bridge over troubled water   
I will lay me down. 


When you're down and out, when you're on the street 
When evening falls so hard, I will comfort you  
I'll take your part, oh, when darkness comes
And pain is all around. 


(& CHORUS)  


Sail on silver girl, sail on by 
Your time has come to shine 
All your dreams are on their way
See how they shine, oh, if you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind.   


(& CHORUS)  


.   
                  Bye Bye Love  


CHORUS:  Bye-bye love, bye-bye happiness
Hello loneliness, I think I'm gonna cry 
Bye-bye love, bye-bye sweet caress  
Hello emptiness, I feel like I could die
So bye, my love, goodbye.   

 thiThere goes my baby, 

There goes my baby, with someone new
She sure looks happy, I sure am blue
She was my baby, till he stepped in 
Goodbye to romance that might have been.


(& CHORUS)  


I'm through with romance, I'm through with love 
I'm through with counting the stars above   
And here's the reason that I'm so free  
My lovin' baby is through with me.

                  California Dreaming   


All the leaves are brown, and the sky is grey   
I went for a walk on a winter's day 
I'd be safe and warm if I were in L.A.  
California dreamin', on such a winter's day.


Stopped into a church I passed along the way
I got down on my knees, and I pretend to pray   
You know the preacher likes the cold
He knows I'm gonna stay 
California dreamin', on such a winter's day.


All the leaves are brown, and the sky is grey   
I went for a walk on a winter's day 
If I didn't tell her, I could leave today   
California dreamin', on such a winter's day 
On such a winter's day, on such a winter's day.

                  Can't Buy Me Love 


Can't buy me love, love 
Can't buy me love.  

S)  I'll buy you a diamo

I'll buy you a diamond ring my friend   
If it makes you feel all right  
I'll get you anything my friend 


If it makes you feel all right  
For I don't care too much for money 
For money can't buy me love.


I'll give you all I've got to give  
If you say you love me too  
I may not have a lot to give
But what I've got, I'll give to you 
For I don't care too much for money 
For money can't buy me love.


Can't buy me love       
Everybody tells me so   
Can't buy me love, no-no-no, no.


Say you don't need no diamond ring  
And I'll be satisfied   
Tell me that you want the kind of things
That money just can't buy   
I don't care too much for money 
For money can't buy me love 
Can't buy me love, love 
Can't buy me love.

CHORUS:  Cecilia, you're breakin' my heart  
You're shakin' my confidence daily  
Oh Cecilia, I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you please to come home 
Come on home.   


Making love in the afternoon
With Cecilia up in my bed room  
I got up to wash my face
When I come back to bed 
Someone's taken my place.

I fall on the floor and I'm laughing (x 2)

                  Circle Game   


Yesterday a child came out to wonder
Caught a dragonfly inside a jar 
Fearful when the sky was full of thunder
And tearful at the falling of a star.   


CHORUS:  And the seasons, they go round and round   
And the painted ponies go up and down   
We're captive on the carousel of time   
We can't return, we can only look   
Behind from where we came   
And go round and round and round in the circle game.
    
Then the child moved ten times round the seasons
Skated over ten clear frozen streams
Words like, when you're older, must appease him 
And promises of someday make his dreams.


(& CHORUS)  


Sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now
Cartwheels turn to car wheels through the town  
And they tell him, take your time, it won't be long now 
Till you drag your feet to slow the circles down.   


(& CHORUS)  


So the years spin by and now the boy is twenty  
Though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true    gooThere'll be new dreams, maybe better dre

There'll be new dreams, maybe better dreams, and plenty 
Before the last revolving year is through.

                  Cotton Jenny  


There's a house on a hill   
By a worndown weathered old mill
In the valley below where the river winds   
There's no such thing as bad times  
And a soft southern flame   
Oh Cotton Jenny's her name  
She wakes me up when the sun goes down  
And the wheels of love go round 
Wheels of love go round, love go round  
Love go round, a joyful sound   
I ain't got a penny for Cotton Jenny to spend   
But then the wheels go round.   


When the new day begins 
I go down to the cotton gin 
And I make my time worthwhile to them   
Then I climb back up again  
And she waits by the door   
"Oh, Cotton Jenny, I'm sore"
She rubs my feet while the sun goes down
And the wheels of love...   


In the hot sickly south 
When they say "Well, shut my mouth" 
I can never be free from the cotton grind   
But I know I got what's mine
A soft southern flame...

                  Crocodile Rock


I remember when rock was young, me and Suzie (Suzie and I?) had so much fun 

Holding hands and skipping stones, had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own  
But the biggest kick I ever got, was doin' a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were Rockin' Round the Clock   
We were hoppin' and boppin' to the Crocodile Rock.  


CHORUS:  Well, Crocodile Rockin' is something shockin'  
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will  
Oh Lordy mama, those Friday nights  
When Suzie wore her dresses tight   
And Crocodile Rockin' was out of sight. 
La, la-la-la-l-la, ...  


But the years went by and the rock just died
Suzie went and left me for some foreign guy 
Long nights cryin' by the record machine
Dreamin' of my Chevy and my old blue jeans  
But they'll never kill the thrills we got   
Burnin' up to the Crocodile Rock
Learnin' fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last.


(& CHORUS)

                  Daniel


Daniel is travelling tonight on a plane 
I can see the red tail lights heading for Spain 
Oh and I can see Daniel waving goodbye  
God, it looks like Daniel   
Must be the clouds in my eye.   


CHORUS:  Oh,

CHORUS:  Oh, Daniel my brother, you are older than me   
Do you still feel the pain  
Of the scars that won't heal
Your eyes have died 
But you see more than I 
Daniel, you're a star in the face of the sky.   


They say Spain is pretty though I've never been 
Well, Daniel says it's the best place he's ever seen
Oh and he should know, he's been there enough   
Lord, I miss Daniel, oh I miss him so much.

                  Did She Mention My Name   


It's so nice to meet an old friend and pass the time of day 
And talk about the hometown a million miles away
Is the ice still in the river, are the old folks still the same 
And by the way, did she mention my name?
Did she mention my name just in passing 
And looking at the rain do you remember 
If she dropped a name or two?   
Is the home team still on fire, do they still win all their games?  
And by the way, did she mention my name?


Is the landlord still a loser, do his signs hang in the hall?   
Are the young girls still as pretty in the city in the fall?
Does the laughter on their faces still put the sun to shame?
And by the way, did she mention my name?
Did she mention my name just in passing?
And when the talk ran high, did the look in her eye seem far away?  
Is the old roof still leaking, when the late snow turns to rain?
And by the way, did she mention my name?
Did she mention my name just in passing?
And looking at the rain do you remember if she dropped a name or two?   
Won't you say hello from someone, there'll be no need to explain
And by the way, did she mention my name?

                  Don't Think Twice, It's All Right 


It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe 
It don't matter anyhow  
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe 
If you don't know by now
When the rooster crows at the break of dawn 
Look out your window and I'll be gone   
You're the reason that I'm travellin' on
Don't think twice, it's all right.  
    
It ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe  
That light I never knowed   
And it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe  
I'm on the dark side of the road
Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay  
We never did too much talkin' anyway
So don't think twice, it's all right.   


I'm walkin' down that long lonesome road, babe  
Where I'm bound I can't tell
But goodbye's too good a word, babe 
So I'll just say, fare thee well
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
You could have done better, but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time  
But don't think twice, it's all right.  


It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal 
Like you never did before   
It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal 
I can't hear you anymore
I'm a-thinkin' and a-wondrin' all the way down the road 
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told  
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul  
But don't think twice, it's all right.

                  Early Morning Rain


In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand  
With an achin' in my heart and my pockets full of sand  
I'm a long way from home, and I miss my loved ones so   
In the early morning rain with no place to go.  


Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go
But I'm stuck here on the grass where the cold wind blows   
Now the liquor tasted good, and the women all were fast 
Well, there 

Well, there she goes my friend, she's rollin' now at last.  


Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high   
She's away and westward bound, far above the clouds she'll fly  
Where the mornin' rain don't fall, and the sun always shines
She'll be flyin' o'er my home in about three hours time.


This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me  
Cause I'm stuck here on the ground as cold and drunk as I can be
You can't jump a jet plane like you can a freight train 
So I'd best be on my way in the early mornin' rain.

                  Easy To Be Hard   


How can people be so heartless? 
How can people be so cruel? 
Easy to be hard, easy to be cold
How can people have no feelings?
How can they ignore their friends?  
Easy to be proud, easy to say no.   


CHORUS:  Especially people who care about strangers 
Who care about evil and social injustice
Do you only care about the bleeding crowd?  
How about a needing friend? (I need a friend.)  


How can people be so heartless? 
You know I'm hung up on you 
Easy to give in, easy to help out.  


(& CHORUS)  


How can people have no feelings?
How can they ignore their friends?  
Easy to be hard, easy to be cold
Easy to be proud, easy to say no.

You look happy to meet me.

Ooh, I need your love babe  
Guess you know it's true
Hope you need my love babe  
Just like I need you
Hold me, love me
Hold me, love me

I'd rather be a sparrow than a snail
Yes I wo

Yes I would, if I could, I surely would, hmmm   
I'd rather be a hammer than a nail  
Yes I would, if I only could, I surely would, hmmm. 


CHORUS:  Away, I'd rather sail away 
Like a swan, that's here and gone   
A man gets tied up to the ground
He gives the world its saddest sound, its saddest sound.


I'd rather be a forest than a street
Yes I would, if I could, I surely would 
I'd rather feel the earth beneath my feet   
Yes I would, if I only could, I surely would.

                  Father And Son


It's not time to make a change  
Just relax, take it easy (Just sit down, take it slowly)
You're still young, that's your fault   
There's so much you have to know (go through)   
Find a girl, settle down
If you want, you can marry  
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy.


I was once like you are now 
And I know that it's not easy   
To be calm when you've found something going on 
But take your time, think a lot 
Think of everything you've got  
For you will still be here tomorrow 
But your dreams may not.


How can I try to explain?   
Cause when I do, he turns away again

..o..I..
fass



It's always been the same, same old story   
From the moment I could talk
I was ordered to listen 
Now there's a way, and I know   
That I have to go away  
I know I have to go.


It's not time...happy.  


All the times that I've cried   
Keeping all the things I knew inside
It's hard, but it's harder to ignore it 
If they were right, I'd agree   
But it's them they know, not me 
Now there's a way, and I know   
That I have to go away  
I know I have to go.

Slow down, you're movin' too fast   
You gotta make the mornin' last 
Just kickin' down the cobblestones  
Lookin' for fun and feelin' groovy  
Ba la ... feelin' groovy.   


Hello lamppost, whatcha knowin' 
I've come to watch your flowers growin' 
Ain't you got no rhymes for me  
Dodndoodoo, feelin' groovy  
Ba la ... feelin' groovy.   


I got no deeds to do, no promises to keep   
I'm dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep   
Let the morningtime drop all its petals on me   
Life, I love you, all is groovy 
Ba la ... la.

                  Fire And Rain 


Just yesterday morning  
They let me know you were gone  
Susan, the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning   
And I wrote down this song  
I just can't remember who to send it to.


CHORUS:  I've seen fire and I've seen rain  
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end 
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend   
But I always thought that I would see you again.


Won't you look down upon me, Jesus  
You got to help me make a stand 
You just got to see me through another day  
My body's achin'
And my time is at hand  
And I won't make it through another day.


(& CHORUS)  


Been walkin' my mind to an easy time
My back turned towards the sun  
Lord knows, when the cold wind blows
It'll turn your head around 
Well, there are hours of time on the telephone line 
To talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground.   


(& CHORUS)

If you miss the train I'm on, you will know that I am gone  
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles   
A hundred miles, a hundred miles, a hundred miles, a hundred miles  
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles.  


Lord I'm one, Lord I'm two, Lord I'm three, Lord I'm four   
Lord I'm five hundred miles away from home  
Away from home, away from home, away from home, away from home  
Lord, I'm five hundred miles away from home.
    
Not a shirt on my back, not a penny to my name  
Lord, I can't go back home this a-way   
This a-way, this a-way, this a-way, this a-way  
Lord, I can't go back home this a-way.

CHORUS:  Four strong winds that blow lonely, seven seas that run high   
All those things that don't change come what may
But our good times are all gone, and I'm bound for movin' on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way.


Think I'll go out to Alberta, the weather's good there in the fall  
I got some friends that I can go to workin' for 
Still I wish you'd change your mind, if I ask you one more time 
But we've been through that a hundred times or more.
    
(& CHORUS)  


If I get there before the snow flies and if things are goin' good   
You could meet me if I sent you down the fare   turnBut by then it would be winter, ain't to

But by then it would be winter, ain't too much for you to do
And those winds sure can blow cold way out there.

Me and my wife settled down 
Now me and my wife are parted   
I'm gonna take another stroll downtown.

Sometimes I live in the country 
Sometimes I live in the town
Sometimes I have a great notion 
To jump into the river and drown.

Stop ramblin' and stop your gamblin'
Stop staying out late at night  
Go home to your wife and your family
Sit down by the fireside bright.

Alas, my love, you do me wrong  
To cast me out discourteously   
When I have loved you so long   
Delighting in your company. 


CHORUS:  Greensleeves was my delight
Greensleeves was my heart of gold   
Greensleeves was my lady love   
And who but my lady Greensleeves.   


I have been ready at your hand  

To grant whatever you would crave   
I have both wagered life and land   
Your love and good will for to have.


(& CHORUS)  


I bought thee kerchiefs to thy head 
That were wrought fine and gallantly
I kept thee both at board and bed   
Which cost my purse well favouredly.


(& CHORUS)  


Thy smock of gold so crimson red
With pearls bedecked sumptuously
The like no other lasses had
And yet thou wouldst not love me.   


(& CHORUS)  


Thy gown was of the grassy green
Thy sleeves of satin hanging by 
Which made thee be our harvest queen
And yet thou wouldst not love me.   


(& CHORUS)  


Thou couldst desire no earthly thing
But still thou hadst it readily 
Thy music still to play and sing
And yet thou wouldst not love me.   


(& CHORUS)  


Well, I will pray to God on high
That thou my constancy mayst see
And that yet once before I die  
Thou wilt vouchsafe to love me. 


(& CHORUS)  


Greensleeves, now farewell, adieu   
God, I pray to prosper thee 
For I am still thy lover true   
Come once again and love me.

I wanna live, I wanna give  
I've been a miner for a heart of gold   
It's these expressions I never give 
That keep me searching for a heart of gold  
And I'm gettin' old.
Keep me searching for a heart of gold   
And I'm gettin' old.


I've been to Hollywood, I've been to Redwood
I'd cross the ocean for a heart of gold 
I've been in my mind, it's such a fine line 
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold 
And I'm gettin' old 
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold  
And I'm gettin' old.


Keep me searching for a heart of gold   
You keep me searching and I'm growin' old   
Keep me searching for a heart of gold   
I've been a miner for a heart of gold.

Don't carry the world upon your shoulder
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

                  How Can You Mend A Broken Heart?  


I can think of younger days 
When living for my life 
Was everything a man could want to do   
I could never see tomorrow  
But I was never told about the sorrow.  
Eh...   

ve bCHORUS:  How can you men

CHORUS:  How can you mend a broken heart?   
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?  
What makes the world go round?  
And how can you mend this broken man?   
How can a loser ever win?   
Please help me mend my broken heart 
And let me live again.  


I can still feel the breeze 
That rustles through the trees  
And misty memories of days gone by  
We could never see tomorrow 
No one said a word about the sorrow 
Eh...

Da da da... 
Please help me mend my broken heart 
And let me live again

                  I Am A Rock   


A winter's day, in a deep and dark December 
I am alone  
Gazing from my window, to the streets below 
On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow   
I am a rock, I am an island.


I've built walls, a fortress deep and mighty
That none may penetrate 
I have no need of friendship, friendship causes pain
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain 
I am a rock, I am an island.


Don't talk of love, but I've heard the word before  
It's sleeping in my memory  
I won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died  

If I never loved I never would have cried   
I am a rock, I am an island.


I have my books and my poetry to protect me 
I am shielded in my armor   
Hiding in my room, safe within my womb  
I touch no-one and no-one touches me
I am a rock, I am an island.


And a rock feels no pain, and an island never cries.

                  I Don't Know How To Love Him  


I don't know how to love him
What to do, how to move him 
I've been changed, yes really changed   
In these past few days when I've seen myself
I seem like someone else.   


I don't know how to take this   
I don't see why he moves me 
He's a man, he's just a man 
And I've had so many men before 
In very many ways he's just one more.   


Don't you think it's rather funny   
I should be in this position
I'm the one who's always been   
So calm, so cool, no lover's fool   
Running every show, he scares me so.


Should I bring him down 
Should I scream and shout   
Should I speak of love  
Let my feelings out 
I never thought I'd come to this
What's it all about?


Yet, if he said he loved me 
I'd be lost, I'd be frightened  
I couldn't cope, I just couldn't cope   
I'd turn my head, I'd back away 
I wouldn't want to know 
He scares me so, I want him so, I love him so.

Well, I know it's kind of late  
I hope I didn't wake you
But what I got to say can't wait
I know you'd understand.


CHORUS:  Everytime I tried to tell you  
 (Everytime the time was right all) 
The words just came out wrong   
So I'll have to say I love you in a song.   


Yeah, I know it's kind of strange   
But everytime I'm near you  
I just run out of things to say 
I know you'd understand.

Yeah, I know it's kind of late  
I hope I didn't wake you
But there's something that I've just got to say 
I know you'd understand.

I brought my girl an apple, she let me hold her hand
I brought my girl an orange, we kissed beneath the band 
I brought my girl bananas, she let me squeeze her tight 
I'm going to bring a watermelon to my girl tonight. 


I brought my girl red ribbons, she hung them

I brought my girl red ribbons, she hung them in her hair
I brought my girl sequins, she stuck them here and there
I brought my girl blue china, she hung it from the shelf
Tonight I'm going to bring a rope and she can hang herself. 


.   
                  I'm Sorry 


It's cold here in the city, it's always been that way   
And I've been thinking about you almost every day   
Thinking about the good times, thinking about the rain  
Thinking about how bad it feels alone again.


I'm sorry for the way things are in China   
I'm sorry things ain't what they used to be 
But more than anything else, I'm sorry for myself   
Cause you're not here with me.  


Our friends all ask about you, I say you're doing fine  
I expect to hear from you almost every time 
But they all know I'm crying, that I can't sleep at night   
They all know I'm dying down deep inside.   


I'm sorry for all the lies I told you   
I'm sorry for the things I didn't say   
But more than anything else, I'm sorry for myself   
I can't believe you went away.  


I'm sorry if I took some things for granted 
I'm sorry for the chains I put on you   the But more than anything else, I'm sor

But more than anything else, I'm sorry for myself   
For living without you.

                  I Need You


We used to laugh, we used to cry
We used to bow our heads and wonder why 
But now you're gone, I guess I'll carry on  
And make the best of what you left to me
Left to me, left to me. 


I need you  
Like the flower needs the rain, you know I need you 
Guess I'll start it all again, you know I need you  
Like the winter needs the spring, you know I need you   
I need you. 


And every day, I'd laugh the hours away 
Just knowing you were thinking of me
And then it came, that I was put to blame   
For every story told about me   
About me, about me. 


I need you  
Like the flower needs the rain, you know I need you 
Guess I'll start it all again, you know I need you  
I need you, I need you  
Like the winter needs the spring, you know I need you   
Guess I'll start it all again, you know I need you  
I need you, I need you.

So how could I dance with another - oooh
When I saw her standin' there?  


Well, she looked at me, and I, I could see  
That before too long I'd fall in love with her  
She wouldn't dance with another - oooh  
When I saw her standin' there.  


Well my heart went boom when I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine.


Well we danced through the night, and we held each other tight  
And before too long I fell in love with her 
Now I'll never dance with another - oooh
When I saw here standin' there  
Since I saw her standin' there  
Since I saw her standin' there.

If a picture paints a thousand words
Then why can't I paint you? 
The words will never show   
The you I've come to know   
If a face could launch a thousand ships 
Then where am I to go?  
There's no-one home but you 
You're all that's left me, too  
And when my love for life is running dry
You come and pour yourself on me.   


If a man could be two places
At one time I'd be with you 
Tomorrow and today  
Beside you all the way  
If the world should stop revolving  
Spinning slowly down to die 
I'd spend the end with you  
And when the world was through  
Then one by one the stars would all go out  
Then you and I would simply fly away.   


.   
                  If I Fell 
    
If I fell in love with you  
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand  
Cause I've been in love before  
And I found that love was more  
Than just holding hands.


If I give my heart to you   
I must be sure from the very start  
That you would love me more than her.   


If I trust in you, oh please
Don't run and hide  
If I love you too, oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her (she?) 
Cause I couldn't stand the pain 
And I would be sad if our new love was (were?) in vain. 


So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you  
And that she will cry   
When she learns we are two  
If I fell in love with you.

If I had a hammer, I'd hammer in the morning    
I'd hammer in the evening, all over this land   
I'd hammer out danger, I'd hammer out a warning 
I'd hammer out love between my brothers and my sisters  
All over this land. 


If I had a bell, I'd ring it in the morning ...

If I had a song, I'd sing it in the morning ... 


Now I've got a hammer, and I've got a bell  
And I've got a song to sing all over this land

It's a song about the love between my brothers and my sisters

                  If You Could Read My Mind 


If you could read my mind, love     
What a tale my thoughts could tell  
Just like an old time movie 
'Bout a ghost from a wishing well   
In a castle dark or a fortress strong   
With chains upon my feet
You know that ghost is me   
And I will never be set free
As long as I'm a ghost that you can't see.  


If I could read your mind, love 
What a tale your thoughts could tell
Just like a paperback novel 
The kind the drug stores sell   
Then you reached the part where the heartaches come 
The hero would be me
But heroes often fail   
And you won't read that book again  
Because the ending's just too hard to take. 


I'd walk away like a movie star 
Who gets burned in a three-way script   
Enter number two:   
A movie queen to play the scene 
Of bringing all the good things out of me   ouldBut for now love

But for now love, let's be real 
I never thought I could feel this way   
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feeling's gone and I just can't get it back.


If you could read my ... feet   
But stories always end  
And if you read between the lines   
You'd know that I'm just tryin' to understand   
The feelings that you lack  
I never thought ... back.

No hell below us, above us only sky 
Imagine all the people, living for today, ah.   


Imagine there's no countries, it isn't hard to do   
Nothing to kill or die for, and no religion too 
Imagine all the people, living life in peace.   


CHORUS:  You, you may say I'm a dreamer 
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us  
And the world will live as one. 


Imagine no possessions, I wonder if you can 
No greed or hunger, a brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people, sharing all the world.

There you go and baby, her am I 
Well, you left me here so I could sit and cry   
Well, golly-gee, what have you done to me   
Well, I guess it doesn't matter any more.   


Do you remember baby, last September
How you held me tight each and every night  
Well, whoops-a-daisy, how you drove me crazy
But I guess it doesn't matter any more. 


CHORUS:  There's no use in me a-crying  
Done everything and now I'm sick of trying  
Roll away my nights and wasted all my days over you.


You go your way, baby, and I'll go mine 
Now and forever till the end of time
I'll find somebody new and baby, you say we're through  
And you won't matter any more.

Down the way where the nights are gay                               
And the sun shines daily from the mountaintop   
I took a trip on a sailing ship 
And when I reached Jamaica I made a stop.   
    
CHORUS:  But I'm sad to say I'm on my way   
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my head is turning around 
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town.  
    
Sounds of laughter everywhere   

And the dancing girls swaying to and fro
I must declare my heart is there
Though I've been from Maine to Mexico.  


(& CHORUS)  


Down at the market you can hear 
Ladies cry out while on their heads they bear   
'Akey' rice, salt fish are nice 
And the rum is fine any time of year.

Was a good friend of mine   
I never understood a single word he said
But I helped him drink his wine 
Yes, he always had some mighty fine wine.   


CHORUS:  Singin', Joy to the World  
All the boys and girls now  
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea  
Joy to you and me.  


If I were the king of the world 
I tell you what I'd do  
I'd throw away the cars and the bars and the wars   
And make sweet love to you  
Yes, I'd make sweet love to you.


(& CHORUS)  


You know I love the ladies  
Love to have my fun 
I'm a high night flyer and a rainbow rider  
A straight-shootin' son of a gun
Yes, a straight-shootin' son of a gun.  
    
(& CHORUS)  


.   
                  Killing Me Softly 

ngs I heard he sang a good song, I h

I heard he sang a good song, I heard he had a style 
And so I came to see him and listen for a while 
And there he was, this young boy, a stranger to my eyes.


CHORUS:  Strumming my pain with his fingers 
Telling my life with his words  
Killing me softly with his song 
Killing me softly with his song 
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song.


He sang as if he knew me in all my dark despair 
And then he looked right through me as if I weren't there   
I prayed that he would finish, but he just kept right on.   


(& CHORUS)  


I felt all flushed with fever, embarassed by the crowd  
I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud   
And there he was, this stranger, singing strong and clear.  


(& CHORUS)  


.   
                  Leaving On A Jet Plane


All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go 
I'm standing here outside your door 
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye
But the dawn is breakin', it's early morn   
The taxi's waiting, he's blowing his horn   
Already I'm so lonesome I could die.


CHORUS:  So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me 
Hold me like you'll never let me go 
Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again  
Oh babe, I hate to go.  


There are so many times I've let you down   
So many times I've played around
I tell you now they do not mean a thing 
Every place I go, I'll think of you 
Every song I sing, I'll sing for you
When I come back, I'll wear your wedding ring.  


(& CHORUS)  


Now the time has come to leave you  
One more time let me kiss you   
Then close your eyes, and I'll be on my way 
Dream about the days to come
When I won't have to leave alone
About the time, I will not have to say. 


(& CHORUS)  


.   
                  Let It Be 


When I find myself in times of trouble  
Mother Mary comes to me 
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be 
And in my hour of darkness  
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be 
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be  
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be. 


And when the broken-hearted people  
Living in the world agree   
There will be an answer, let it be  
For though they may be parted   
There is still a chance that they will see  

There will be an answer, let it be  
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be  
There will be an answer, let it be. 


And when the night is cloudy    
There is still a light that shines on me
Shine until tomorrow, let it be 
I wake up to the sound of music 
Mother Mary comes to me 
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be 
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be  
There will be an answer, let it be. 


.   
                  Like A Rolling Stone  


Once upon a time you dressed so fine
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People'd call, say "Beware doll 
You're bound to fall", you thought they were all just kiddin' you   
You used to laugh about 
Everybody that was hangin' out  
Now you don't talk so loud  
Now you don't seem so proud 
About having to be scrounging for your next meal.   


CHORUS:  How does it feel, how does it feel 
To be without a home, like a complete unknown   
Like a rolling stone?   


You've gone to the finest school all right  
Miss Lonely but you know you only used to get juiced in it  
And nobody's ever taught you how
To live on the street and now you're gonna have to get used to it   od sYou said

You said you'd never compromise 
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize 
He's not sellin' any alibis 
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And ask him, "Do you want to make a deal?"  


(& CHORUS)  


You never turned around to see the frowns   
On the jugglers and the clowns  
When they all came down and did tricks for you  
You never understood that it ain't no good  
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you   
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat 
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat   
Ain't it hard when you discovered that  
He wasn't really where it's at  
After he took from you everything he could steal.   


(& CHORUS)  


Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people're
Drinkin', thinkin' that they've got it made 
Exchangin' all kinds of precious gifts and things   
But you'd better lift your diamond ring 
You'd better pawn it, babe  
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used   
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse   
When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose   
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.


(& CHORUS)

                  Lovely Rita   


Lovely Rita, meter maid, nothing can come between us
When it gets dark, I tow your heart away
Standing by a parking meter, when I caught a glimpse of Rita
Filling in a ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older, and the bag across her shoulder 
Made her look a little like a military man. 


Lovely Rita, meter maid, may I inquire discreetly   
When are you free to take some tea with me  
Took her out and tried to win her, had a laugh and over dinner  
Told her I would really like to see her again   
Got the bill and Rita paid it, took her home and nearly made it 
Sitting on a sofa with a sister or two. 


Lovely Rita, meter maid, where would I be without you?  
Give us a wink and make me think of you.


Lovely Rita, meter maid...

                  Me And Bobby McGee


Busted flat in Baton Rouge, headin' for the train   
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down, just before it rained  
Took us all the way to New Orleans  
I took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana   
And was blowin' sad while Bobby sang the blues  
With them windshield wipers slappin' time and Bobby clappin' hands  
We fin'ly sang up every song that driver knew.  


CHORUS:  Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose   
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free   
Feeling good was easy Lord when Bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me 
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee. 


From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun   
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul 
Standin' right beside me, Lord, through everything I done   
Every night she kept me from the cold   
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord, I let her slip away  
Searchin' for the home I hope she'll find   
And I'd give all my tomorrows for a single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body close to mine. 


(& CHORUS)

                  Moon Shadow   


CHORUS:  I'm being followed by a moon shadow, moon shadow, moon shadow  
Leaping and hopping on a moon shadow, moon shadow, moon shadow. 


And if I ever lose my hands, lose my plough, lose my lands  
Oh, if I ever lose my hands, oh if...   
I won't have to work no more    
And if I ever lose my eyes, if my colours all run dry   to gYes, if I ever lose my eyes,


..o..I..

Yes, if I ever lose my eyes, oh if...   
I won't have to cry no more.


(& CHORUS)  


And if I ever lose my legs, I won't moan and I won't beg
Oh, if I ever lose my legs, oh if...
I won't have to walk no more
And if I ever lose my mouth, all my teeth, north and south  
Yes, if I ever lose my mouth, oh if...  
I won't have to talk.   


Did it take long to find me, I asked the faithful light 
Did it take long to find me, and are you gonna stay the night?  


(& CHORUS)  


Moon shadow, moon shadow
Moon shadow, moon shadow.

                  Morning Has Broken


Morning has broken like the first morning   
Blackbird has spoken like the first bird
Praise for the singing, praise for the morning  
Praise for them springing fresh from the world. 


Sweet the rain's new fall, sunlit from heaven   
Like the first dew fall on the first grass  
Praise for the sweetness of the wet garden  
Sprung in completeness where his feet pass. 


Mine is the sunlight, mine is the morning   
Born of the one light Eden saw play 
Praise with elation, praise every morning   
God's recreation of the new day.

                  Mother And Child Reunion  


CHORUS:  No, I would not give you false hopes   
On this strange and mournful day
But the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away.  


Oh, little darling of mine  
I just can't for the life of me 
Remember a sadder day   
I know they say let it be   
But it just don't work out that way 
And the course of a lifetime runs   
Over and over again.


(& CHORUS)  


Oh, little darling of mine  
I just can't believe it's so
And though it seems strange to say  
I never been laid so low
In such a mysterious way
And the course of a lifetime runs   
Over and over again.


(& CHORUS)  


Oh, the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away   
Oh, the mother and child reunion
Is only a moment away.

                  Mr. Bojangles 


I knew a man, Bojangles, and he danced for you  
In worn out shoes   
With silver hair, a ragged shirt and baggy pants
The old soft shoe   
He jumped so high, jumped so high   
Then he lightly touched down.   


I met him in a cell in New Orleans, I was   
Down and out
He looked too me to be the eyes of age  
As he spoke right out   
He talked of life, talked of life   
He laughed, slapped his leg a step. 


CHORUS:  Mr. Bojangles (x 3)
          Dance.


He said his name Bojangles, then he danced a lick   
Across the cell 
He grabbed his pants, a better stance, oh he jumped up high 
He clicked his heels
He let go a laugh, let go a laugh   
Shook back his clothes all around.  


He danced for those at minstrel shows and country fairs 
Throughout the South
He spoke with tears of fifteen years, how his dog and he
Traveled about  
His dog up and died, he up and died 
After twenty years he still grieved.


(& CHORUS)  


He said "I dance now at every chance in honky tonks 
For drinks and tips 
But most of the time I spend behind these country bars" 
He said "I drinks a bit"
He shook his head, and as he shook his head 
I heard someone ask please. 


(& CHORUS)  


.   
                  Mr. Tambourine Man


CHORUS:  Hey, Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy, and there is no place I'm going to  
Hey, Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me 
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you.   

my eThou

Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand  
Vanished from my hand   
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleepin'
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet  
I have no one to meet   
And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreamin'.   


(& CHORUS)  


Take me on a trip upon your swirling magic ship 
My senses have been stripped
My hands can feel to grip, my boots too numb to step
Wait only for my boot heels to be wanderin' 
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade 
Into my own parade  
Cast your dancin' spell my way, I promise to go under it.   


(& CHORUS)  


Though you might hear laughin', spinnin', swingin' madly across the sun 
It's not aimed at anyone
It's just escapin' on the run   
And but for the sky there are no fences facin'  
And if you hear vague traces of skippin' reels of rhyme 
To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind 
I wouldn't pay it any mind  
It's just a shadow you're seein' that he's chasin'. 


(& CHORUS)  


Then take me disappearin' through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach   
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow  
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand wavin' free 
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands 
With all memory and fate, driven deep beneath the waves 
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.   


(& CHORUS)  


.   
                  Obladi, Oblada


Desmond had a barrow in the marketplace 
Molly was a singer in a band
Desmond says to Molly, "Girl, I like your face" 
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand.   


CHORUS:  Obladi, oblada, life goes on, brah 
La, la, how the life goes on. (x 2) 


Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweller's store 
Buys a twenty karat golden ring 
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door  
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing.   


(& CHORUS)  


In a couple of years they have built a home sweet home  
With a couple of kids running in the yard, of Desmond and Molly Jones.  


Happy ever after in the market place
Molly lets the children lend a hand 
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face  
And in the evening he's a singer with the band. 


(& CHORUS)  


And if you want some fun, take Obladi-blada.

                  One Tin Soldier   


Listen, children, to a story that was written long ago  
'Bout a kingdom on a mountain and the valley folk below 
On the mountain was a treasure buried deep beneath a stone  
And the valley people swore they'd have it for their very own.  


CHORUS:  Go ahead and hate your neighbour, go ahead and cheat a friend  
Do it in the name of heaven, you can justify it in the end  
There won't be any trumpets blowing come the judgment day   
On the bloody morning after, one tin soldier rides away.


So the people of the valley sent a message up the hill  
Asking for the buried treasure, tons of gold for which they'd kill  
Came an answer from the kingdom, 'With our brothers we will share   
All the secrets of our mountain, all the riches buried there.'  


(& CHORUS)  


Now the valley cried with anger, 'Mount your horses, draw your sword'   
And they killed the mountain people, so they won their just reward  
Now they stood beside the treasure on the mountain dark and red 
Turned the stone and looked beneath it, 'Peace on earth' was all it said.   



(& CHORUS)  


.   
                  Operator  


Operator, could you help me place this call?
You see the number on the matchbook is old and faded
She's living in L.A., with my best old ex-friend Ray
A guy she said she knew well and sometimes hated.   


CHORUS:  Isn't that the way they say it goes
But let's forget all that   
And give me the number if you can find it   
So I can call just to tell her I'm fine, and to show
I've overcome the blow, I've learned to take it well
I only wish my words could just convince myself 
That it just wasn't real, but that's not the way it feels.  


Operator, could you help me place this call 
Cause I can't read the number that you just gave me 
There's something in my eyes, you know it happens every time
I think about the love that I thought would save me.


(& CHORUS)  


Operator, let's forget about this call  
There's no one there I really wanted to talk to 
Thank for your time, cause you've been so much more than kind   
And you can keep the dime.  


(& CHORUS)  


.   
                  Our House 


I'll light the fire, you place the flowers  
In the vase that you bought today   
Staring at the fire for hours and hours 
While I listen to you play your love songs  
All night long for me, only for me. 


CHORUS:  Our house is a very, very, very fine house 
With two cats in the yard, life used to be so hard  
Now everything is easy cause of you 
Ooo wa, la la la... 


Come to me now, and rest your head for just five minutes
Everything is done  
Such a cozy room, the windows are illuminated   
By the evening sunshine through them
Fiery gems for you, only for you.   


(& CHORUS)  


Oo wa, I'll light the fire, you place the flowers   
In the vase that you bought today.

                  Penny Lane


Penny Lane, there is a barber showing photographs   
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know 
And the people that come and go, stop and say hello 
On the corner is a banker with a motor car  
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac in the pouring rain
Very strange.   


CHORUS:  Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies   
I sit and meanwhile back.   

 witIn Penny Lane there is a fir

In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass  
And in his pocket is a portrait of the queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean, it's a clean machine.   
    
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes 
Full of fish and finger pies in summer, meanwhile back. 


Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout  
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray   
And though she feels as if she's in a play, she is anyway   
Penny Lane, the barber shaves another customer  
We see the banker sitting, waiting for a trim   
And then the fireman rushes in, from the pouring rain   
Very strange.   


(& CHORUS)  


Penny Lane!

                  Piano Man 


It's nine o'clock on a Saturday 
The regular crowd shuffles in   
There's an old man sitting next to me   
Making love to his tonic and gin
He says "Son, can you play me a memory  
I'm not really sure how it goes 
But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete  
When I wore a younger man's clothes.


CHORUS:  Da, da dee da...   
Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight  
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feeling all right.




Now John at the bar is a friend of mine 
He gets me my drinks for free   
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
But there's some place that he'd rather be  
He said "Bill, I believe this is killing me"
As a smile ran away from his face   
"Well, I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place."  


(& CHORUS)  


Now Paul is a real estate novelist  
Who never had time for a wife   
And he's talking with Davy, who's still in the navy     
And probably will be for life   
And the waitress is practicing politics 
As the businessmen slowly get stoned
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness   
But it's better than drinking alone.


(& CHORUS)  


It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday 
And the manager gives me a smile
Cause he knows that it's me they've been coming to see  
To forget about life for a while
And the piano sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer   
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar 
And say "Man, what are you doing here?" 


(& CHORUS)  


.   
                  Proud Mary


Left a good job in the city 
Workin' for the man every night and day 
And I never lost one minute of sleepin' 
Worryin' 'bout the way things might have been.  


CHORUS:  Big wheel keep on turnin'  
Proud Mary keep on burnin'  
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river. 


Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis  
Pumped a lot of gas down in New Orleans 
But I never saw the good side of the city   
Till I hitched a ride on the riverboat queen.   


(& CHORUS)  


If you come down to the river   
Bet you gonna find some people who live 
You don't have to worry cause you have no money 
People on the river are happy to give.

                  Puff the Magic Dragon 


Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea  
And frolicked in the autumn mist    
In a land called Honah Lee  
Little Jackie Paper loved that rascal Puff  
And brought him strings and sealing wax 
And other fancy stuff.  


CHORUS:  Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea 
And frolicked in the autumn mist    
In a land called Honah Lee. (x 2)   


Together they would travel on a boat with billowed sail 
Jackie kept a lookout perched on Puff's gigantic tail   e thNoble kings 

Noble kings and princes would bow whene'er they came
Pirate ships would lower their flags when Puff roared out his name. 


(& CHORUS)  


A dragon lives forever, but not so little boys  
Painted wings and giant rings make way for other toys   
One grey night it happened, Jackie Paper came no more   
And Puff that mighty dragon, he ceased his fearless roar.   
    
(& CHORUS)  


His head was bent with sorrow, green scales fell like rain  
Puff no longer went to play along the cherry lane   
Without his lifelong friend Puff could not be brave 
So Puff that mighty dragon sadly slipped into his cave. 


(& CHORUS)

                  Roll Me Over  


Now this is number one, and the fun has just begun  
Roll me over, lay me down, and do it again  
Roll me over, in the clover 
Roll me over, lay me down, and do it again. 


Now this is number two, and she asked me for a screw... 


...three, and I've got her on my knee...


...four, and we did it on the floor...  


...five, and I don't think I'll survive...  


...six, and she said she liked my tricks... 


...seven, and I thought I was in heaven...

                  Ruby Tuesday  


She would never say where she came from 
Yesterday don't matter if it's gone 
While the sun is bright or in the darkest night 
No one knows, she comes and goes.   


CHORUS:  Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday  
Who could hang a name on you?   
When you change with every new day  
Still I'm gonna miss you.   


Don't question why she needs to be so free  
She'll tell you it's the only way to be 
She just can't be chained to a life where nothings gained   
And nothing's lost, at such a cost. 


(& CHORUS)  


There's no time to lose, I heard her say
Cash your dreams before they slip away  
Dying all the time, lose your dreams
And you will lose your mind, ain't life unkind?

If you're going to San Francisco
Be sure to wear some flowers in your hair   
If you're going to San Francisco
You're gonna meet some gentle people there. 


For those who come to San Francisco 
Summer time will be a love-in there 
In the streets of San Francisco 
Gentle people with flowers in their hair.   


All across the nation, such a strong vibration  
People in motion
There's a whole generation, with a new explanation  
People in motion, people in motion. 


For those who come to San Francisco 
Be sure to wear some flowers in your hair   
If you come to San Francisco
Summer time will be a love-in there 
If you come to San Francisco
Summer time will be a love-in there.

                  Scarborough Fair/Canticle 


Are you going to Scarborough Fair?  
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme   
Remember me to one who lives there  
She once was a true love of mine.   


Tell her to make me a cambric shirt 
                   On the side of a hill in the deep forest green   
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme   
                            Tracing of sparrow on snow-crested brown
Without no seams nor needle work
                     Blankeys and bedclothes, the child of the mountain 
Then she'll be a true love of mine. 
                              Sleeps unaware of the clarion call.   


Tell her to find me and acre of land

                 On the side of a hill a sprinkling of leaves   
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme   
                            Washes the grave with silvery tears 
Between the salt water and the sea strands  
                       A soldier cleans and polishes a gun  
Then she'll be a true love of mine. 
                              Sleeps unaware of the clarion call.   


Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather
                           War bellows blazing in scarlet battalions
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme   
                            Generals order their soldiers to kill   
And gather it all in a bunch of heather 
                  And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten   
Then she'll be a true love of mine.

                  Something 


Something in the way she moves  
Attracts me like no other lover 
Something in the way she woos me.   


CHORUS:  I don't want to leave her now  
You know I believe and how  
You're asking me, Will my love grow?
I don't know, I don't know  
You stick around now, it may show   
I don't know, I don't know. 


Somewhere in her smile she knows
That

That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me.   


(& CHORUS)  


Something in the way she knows  
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now   
You know I believe and how.

                  Song Sung Blue


Song sung blue, everybody knows one 
Song sung blue, every garden grows one  
Me and you are subject to the blues now and then
But when you take the blues and make a song 
You sing them out again, sing them out again.   


Song sung blue, weeping like a willow   
Song sung blue, sleeping on my pillow   
Funny thing, but you can sing with a cry in your voice  
And before you know it, start to feeling good   
You simply got no choice.   


(& 1ST VERSE)   


Song sung blue, song sung blue.

                  Sunrise, Sunset   


Is this the little girl I carried?  
Is this the little boy at play? 
I don't remember growing older  
When did they?  


When did she get to be a beauty?
When did he grow to be so tall? 
Wasn't it yesterday when they were small?   

sco CHORUS:  Sunrise, sunset, sunrise, s

CHORUS:  Sunrise, sunset, sunrise, sunset   
Swiftly flow the days   
Seedlings turn overnight to sunflowers  
Blossoming ever as we gaze  
Sunrise, sunset, sunrise, sunset
Swiftly fly the years   
One season following another
Laden with happiness and tears. 


Now is the little boy a bridegroom  
Now is the little girl a bride  
Under the canopy I see them 
Side by side


Place the gold ring around her finger   
Share the sweet wine and break the glass
Soon the full circle will have come to pass.

                  Sunshine On My Shoulders  


CHORUS:  Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy    
Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry 
Sunshine on the water looks so lovely   
Sunshine almost always makes me high.   


If I had a day that I could give you
I'd give you a day just like today  
If I had a song that I could sing for you   
I'd sing a song to make you feel this way.  


If I had a tale that I could tell you   
I'd tell a tale sure to make you smile  
If I had a wish that I could wish for you   
I'd make a wish for sunshine all the while.

                  Sweet Caroline


Where it began, I can't begin to know it
But then I know it's growing strong 
Was in the spring, and spring became the summer 
Who could believe you'd come along  
Hand, touchin' hand, reachin' out   
Touchin' me, touchin' you.  


CHORUS:  Sweet Caroline, good times never seemed so good
I've been tryin' to believe they never would.   


But now I look at tonight, it all seems so lonely   
We fill it up with only two 
Then when I hurt, hurtin' runs off my shoulder  
How can I hurt when holdin' you?
Warm, touchin' warm, reachin' out   
Touchin' me, touchin' you.  


(& CHORUS)  


.   
                  Take It Easy  


Well, I'm a-runnin' down the road, tryin' to loosen my load 
I got seven women on my mind
Four that wanna own me, two that wanna stone me 
One says she's a friend of mine 
Take it easy, take it easy  
Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy  
Lighten up while you still can  
Don't even try to understand
Just find a place to make your stand, and take it easy. 


Now, I'm a-standin' on a corner in Winslow, Arizona 
With such a fine sight to see   le sIt's a girl, my 

It's a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed Ford 
Slowin' down to have a look at me   
Come on baby, don't say maybe   
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me
We may lose or we may win   
But we will never be here again 
Oh, open up, I'm climbin' in to take it easy.   


Well, I'm a-runnin' down the road tryin' to loosen my load  
Got a world of trouble on my mind   
I'm lookin' for a lover who won't blow my cover 
She's just a little hard to find
Take it easy, take it easy  
Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy  
Come on baby, don't say maybe   
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me.

                  Take Me Home, Country Roads   


Almost heaven, West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River  
Life is old there, older than the trees 
Younger than the mountains, growin' like a breeze.  


CHORUS:  Country Roads, take me home
To the place I belong   
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads.
(Take me home, country roads.)  


All my mem'ries gather round her
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky  
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye.   


(& CHORUS)  


I hear her voice, in the mornin' hours she calls me 
The radio reminds me of my home far away
And drivin' down the road I get a feelin'   
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday.  


(& CHORUS)  


.   
                  Teach Your Children   


You who are on the road must have a code
That you can live by
And so become yourself because the past 
Is just a goodbye.  


CHORUS:  Don't you ever ask them why
If they told you, you would cry 
So just look at them and sigh   
And know they love you. 


Teach your children well, their father's hell   
Will slowly go by   
And feed them on your dreams, the one they picks
The one you'll know by. 


(& CHORUS)  


And you of the tender years can't know the fears
That your elders grew by
And so please help them with your youth, they seek the truth
Before they can die.


(& CHORUS)  


Teach your parents well, their children's hell  
Will slowly go by   
And feed them on your dreams, the one they picks
The one you'll know by.

                  The Boxer 


I am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told 
I have squandered my resistance 
For a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises   
All lies and jests, still a man hears what he wants to hear 
And disregards the rest.


When I left my home and my family, I was no more than a boy 
In the company of strangers 
In the quiet of a railway station, running scared   
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go  
Looking for the places only they would know.


CHORUS:  Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie, lie la lie   
Lie la lie la la la lie la la la la lie.


Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job   
But I get no offers 
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue
I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome   
I took some comfort there, la la la-la-la-la la.


Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone
Goin' home, where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me  
Leading me, goin' home. 


In the clearing stands a boxer, and a fighter by his trade  
And he carries the reminders of every glove that laid him down  
Or cut him till he cried out, in his anger and his shame
"I am leaving, I am leaving" but the fighter still remains. 


(& CHORUS)  


.   
                  The Long And Winding Road 


The long and winding road that leads to your door   
Will never disappear, I've seen that road before
It always leads me here, lead me to your door.  


The wild and windy night that the rain washed away  
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day 
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way.


Many times I've been alone, and many times I've cried   
Anyway, you'll never know the many ways I've tried. 


But still they lead me back to the long winding road
You left me standing here, a long long time ago 
Don't leave me waiting here, lead me to your door.

                  The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down   


Virgil Caine is my name and I served on the Danville train  
Till Stoneman's cavalry came, and tore up the tracks again  
In the winter of sixty-five, we were hungry, just barely alive  
It was May the tenth that Richmond fell 
It was a time I remember oh so well.

ted CHORUS:  The night they drove old Dixie down, and all the be

CHORUS:  The night they drove old Dixie down, and all the bells were ringin'
The night they drove old Dixie down, and the people were singin'
They went, "La la la..."


Back with my wife in Tenessee, and one day she said to me   
"Virgil, quick, come see, there goes Robert E. Lee" 
Now I don't mind choppin' wood, and I don't care if the money's no good 
You take what you need and leave the rest   
But they should never have taken the very best. 


(& CHORUS)  


Like my father before me, I will work the land  
Just like my brother above me, who took a rebel stand   
He was just eighteen, proud and brave, but a Yankee laid him in his grave   
I swear by the mud below my feet
You can't raise a Caine back up when he's in defeat.


(& CHORUS)  


.   
                  The Rose  


Some say love, it is a river
That drowns the tender reed 
Some say love, it is a razor
That leaves your soul to bleed  
Some say love, it is a hunger   
An endless, aching need 
I say love, it is a flower  
And you, its only seed. 


It's the heart afraid of breaking   
That never learns to dance  
It's the dream afraid of waking 
That never takes the chance 
It's the one who won't be taken 
Who cannot seem to give 
And the soul afraid of dying
That never learns to live.  


When the night has been too lonely  
And the road has been too long  
And you think that love is only 
For the lucky and the strong
Just remember in the winter 
Far beneath the bitter snows
Lies the seed that with the sun's love  
In the spring becomes the rose.

                  The Song of the Count 


You know that I am called the Count 
Because I really love to count  
Sometimes I sit and count all day   
But...sometimes I get carried away. 


CHORUS:  I count slowly, slowly, slowly getting faster  
Once I start in counting, it's wery hard to stop, hey!  
Faster, faster, it is so exciting   
I could count forever, count until I drop (Ha! Ha!) 
1, 2, 3, 4, 1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4
1-2-I love counting, whatever the amount
1, 2, 3, 4, Hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey  
1-2-3-4, 1-2-That's the song of the count!  (Hey!)  


I count the spiders on the wall 
I count the cobwebs in the hall 
I count the candles on the shelf, Aaah...   
When I'm alone I count myself, oh yes...

                  The Sound Of Silence  


Hello darkness, my old friend   
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping 
And the vision that was planted in my brain 
Still remains   
Within the sound of silence.


In restless dreams I walked alone   
Narrow streets of cobblestone   
'Neath the halo of a streetlamp 
I turned my collar to the cold and damp 
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light  
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.   


And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more 
People talking without speaking 
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared   
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence.   


"Fools!" said I, "You do not know   
Silence like a cancer grows 
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you"
But my words like silent raindrops fell 
And echoed in the wells of silence. 


And the people bowed and prayed 
To the neon god they made   
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said "The words of the prophet 
Are written on the subway walls, and tenement halls 
And whispered in the sounds of silence."


.   
                  The Times, They Are A-Changin'


Come gather round people, wherever you roam 
And admit that the waters around you have grown 
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone  
If your time to you is worth savin' 
Then you better start swimmin' or you'll sink like a stone  
For the times, they are a-changin'. 


Come writers and critics, who prophesy with your pen
And keep your eyes wide, the chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon, for the wheel's still in spin 
And there's no tellin' who that it's namin' 
For the loser now will be later to win  
For the times, they are a-changin'. 


Come senators, congressmen, please heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall 
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
There's a battle outside and it's ragin'
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls 
For the times, they are a-changin'. 


Come mothers and fathers, throughout the land   
And don't criticize what you don't understand   er tYour sons an

Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly agin'  
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand   
For the times, they are a-changin'. 


The line it is drawn, the curse it is cast  
The slow one now will later be fast 
As the present now will later be past   
The order is rapidly fadin' 
And the first one now will later be last
For the times, they are a- changin'.

                  The Unicorn   


A long time ago when the earth was green
There were more kinds of animals than you'd ever seen   
They'd run around free when the earth was being born
But the loveliest of all was the Unicorn.   


CHORUS:  There were green alligators and long-necked geese  
Some hump-back camels and some chimpanzees  
Some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born   
The loveliest of all was the Unicorn.   


Now God seen some sinnin' and it gave him pain  
And he said 'Stand back, I'm going to make it rain' 
He says, 'Hey brother Noah, I'll tell you what to do
Build me a floating zoo.'   


(& CHORUS)  


Now Noah was there to answer the call    couHe finished making the ark just as the rain 

He finished making the ark just as the rain started to fall 
He marched up the animals two by two
And he called out as they went through. 


(& CHORUS)  


Noah looked out through the driving rain
Those Unicorns were hiding, playing silly games 
Kicking and splashing as the rain began to pour 
Oh, those silly Unicorns.   


(& CHORUS)  


The ark started moving, it floated with the tide
The Unicorns looked up from their rocks and cried   
The waters came down and simply floated them away   
That's why you've never seen a Unicorn to this day.

                  This Land Is Your Land


CHORUS:  This land is your land, this land is my land   
From Bonavista to Vancouver Island  
From the Arctic Circle to the Great Lake waters 
This land was made for you and me.  


I roamed and I rambled and brought my footsteps 
To the sparkling sand, her diamond glances  
And all around me, a voice was singing  
This land was made for you and me.  


(& CHORUS)  


As I went walking that ribbon of highway
I saw above me an endless skyway
I saw below me that golden village  
This land was made for you and me.  


(& CHORUS)  


.   
                  Those Were The Days   


Once upon a time there was a tavern 
Where we used to raise a glass or two   
Remember how we laughed away the hours  
And dreamed of all the great things we would do.


CHORUS:  Those were the days, my friend 
We thought they'd never end 
We'd sing and dance forever and a day   
We'd live the life we choose    
We'd fight and never lose   
For we were young and sure to have our way  
La la la... 
Those were the days, oh yes, those were the days.   


Then the busy years went rushing by us  
We lost our starry notions on the way   
If by chance I'd see you in the tavern  
We'd smile at one another and we'd say. 


(& CHORUS)  


Just tonight I stood before the tavern  
Nothing seemed the way it used to be
In the glass I saw a strange reflection 
Was that lonely fellow really me?   


(& CHORUS)  


Through the door there came familiar laughter   
I saw your face and heard you call my name  
Oh, my friend, we're older but no wiser 
For in our hearts our dreams are still the same.

                  Tie A Yellow Ribbon Round The Ole Oak Tree


I'm comin' home, I've done my time  
Now I've got to know what is and isn't mine 
If you received my letter tellin' you I'd soon be free  
Then you'll know just what to do
If you still want me, if you still want me. 


CHORUS:  Tie a yellow ribbon round the ole oak tree 
It's been three long years, do you still want me?   
If I don't see a ribbon round the ole oak tree  
I'll stay on the bus, forget about us   
Put the blame on me 
If I don't see a yellow ribbon round the ole oad tree.  


Bus driver please look for me   
Cause I couldn't bear to see what I might see   
I'm really still in prison and my love, she holds the key   
A simple yellow ribbon's what I need to set me free 
I wrote and told her please.


(& CHORUS)  


Now the whole damn bus is cheering  
And I can't believe I see   
A hundred yellow ribbons round the ole oak tree.

                  Time In A Bottle  


If I could save time in a bottle
The first thing that I'd like to do 
Is to save every day till eternity passes away  
Just to spend them with you 
If I could make days last forever   
If words could make wishes come true
I'd save every day like a treasure and then 
Again, I would spend them with you. 


CHORUS:  But there never seems to be enough time
To do the things you want to do once you find them  
I've looked around enough to know   
You're the one I want to go through time with.  


If I had a box just for wishes  
And dreams that had never come true 
The box would be empty except for the memory
Of how they were answered by you.

Hang your head Tom Dooley, hang your head and cry   
Killed poor Laura Foster, you know you bound to die.


You took her on the hillside, as God Almighty knows 
You took her on the hillside, and there you hid her clothes.


You took her by the roadside, where you begged to be excused
You took her by the roadside, where there you hid her shoes.


CHORUS:  Hang your head Tom Dooley, hang your head and cry  
Hang your head Tom Dooley, you know you bound to die.   


You took her on the hillside, to make her be your wife  
You took her on the hillside, where there you took her life.    nd m



Take down my old violin, and play it all you please 
At this time tomorrow, it'll be no use to me.   


(& CHORUS)  


I dug a grave four feet long, I dug it three feet deep  
And throwed the cold clay o'er her, and tramped it with my feet.


This world and one more, and reckon where I'd be
If it hadn't been for Grayson, I'd a-been in Tennessee.

CHORUS:  To everything, turn, turn, turn
There is a season, turn, turn, turn 
And a time for every purpose under heaven.  


A time to be born, a time to die
A time to plant, a time to reap 
A time to kill, a time to heal  
A time to laugh, a time to weep.


(& CHORUS)  


A time to build, a time to break down   
A time to dance, a time to mourn
A time to cast away stones  
A time to gather stones together.   


(& CHORUS)  


A time of love, a time of hate  
A time of war, a time of peace  
A time you may embrace  
A time to refrain from embracing.

A time to gain, a time to lose  
A time to rend, a time to sew   
A time to love, a time to hate  
A time for peace, I swear it's not too late.

Chewin' on a piece of grass, walkin' down the road  
Tell me, how long you gonna stay here Joe?  
Some people say, this town don't look so good in snow   
You don't care, I know. 


CHORUS:  Ventura highway in the sunshine
Where the days are longer, the nights are stronger than moonshine   
You're gonna go, I know 
Cause the free wind is blowin' through your hair
And the days surround your daylight there   
Seasons crying, no despair  
Alligator lizards in the air, in the air
Did di di dit...


Wishin' on a fallin' star, waitin' for the early train  
Sorry boy, but I've been hit by purple rain 
Aw, come on Joe, you can always change your name
Thanks a lot son, just the same.

Starry, starry night, paint your palette blue and grey  
Look out on a summer's day  
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul 
Shadows on the hills, sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills  
In colours on the snowy linen land.

CHORUS:  Now I understand (Now I think I know)  
What you tried to say to me 
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free  
They would not listen   
They did not know how (They're not listening still) 
Perhaps they'll listen now. (Perhaps they never will.)  


Starry, starry night, flaming flowers that brightly blaze   
Swirling clouds in violet haze reflect in Vincent's eyes of China blue  
Colours changing hue, morning fields of amber grain 
Weathered faces lined in pain   
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand.   


(& CHORUS)  


For they could not love you, but still your love is true
And when no hope was left in sight, on that starry, starry night
You took your life as lovers often do   
But I could have told you Vincent   
This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you. 


Starry, starry night, portraits hung in empty halls 
Frameless heads on nameless walls   
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget 
Like the strangers that you've met  
The ragged man in ragged clothes
The silver thorn of bloody rose 
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow.

When I get older, losing my hair
Many years from now 
Will you still be sending me a Valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine? 
If I'd been out till quarter to three   
Would you lock the door?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me  
When I'm sixty-four?


I could be handy mending a fuse 
When your lights have gone  
You can knit a sweater by the fireside  
Sunday mornings go for a ride   
Doing the gardens, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more? 
Will you still need me, will you still feed me  
When I'm sixty-four?


Every summer we can rent a cottage in the Isle of Wight 
If it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee  
Vera, Chuck and Dave.   


Send me a postcard, drop me a line  
Stating point of view   
Indicate precisely what you mean to say 
Yours sincerely, wasting away   
Give me an answer, fill in a form   
Mine forever more   
Will you still need me, will you still feed me  
When I'm sixty-four?

While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping 
Still my guitar gently weeps.   


I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love 
I don't know how someone controlled you 
They bought and sold you.   


I look at the world and I notice it's turning   
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning   
Still my guitar gently weeps.   


I don't know how you were diverted  
You were perverted too  
I don't know how you were inverted  
No-one alerted you.

.   
                  Wild World


Now that I've lost everything to you
You say you want to start something new 
And it's breaking my heart you're leaving   
Baby, I'm grieving  
But if you want to leave, take good care
Hope you have a lot of nice things to wear  
But then a lot of nice things turn bad out there.   


CHORUS:  Oh baby, baby, it's a wild world   
It's hard to get by just upon a smile   
Oh baby, baby, it's a wild world
I'll always remember you like a child, girl.


You know I've seen a lot of what the world can do   
And it's breakin' my heart in two   
Because I never want to see you sad, girl   
Don't be a bad girl 
But if you want to leave, take good care
Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there   
But just remember there's a lot of bad and beware.  


(& CHORUS)  


.   
                  Will You Love Me Tomorrow?


Tonight you're mine completely  
You give your love so sweetly   
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes   
But will you love me tomorrow?  
Is this a lasting treasure  
Or just a moment's pleasure?
Can I believe the magic of your sighs? (size?)  
Will you still love me tomorrow?


Tonight, with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one   
But will my heart be broken 
When the night meets the morning sun?   


I'd like to know that your love 
Is love I can be sure of
So, tell me now, and I won't ask again  
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me tomorrow?

                  With A Little Help From My Friends


What would you do if I sang out of tune 
Would you stand up and walk out on me?  
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song  
And I'll try not to sing out of key.


CHORUS:  Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, I get high with a little help from my friends   
Mm, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends.   


Do you need anybody?  I need somebody to love   
Could it be anybody?  I want somebody to love.  


What do I do when my love is away?  
Does it worry you to be alone?  
How do I feel by the end of the day?
Are you sad because you're on your own? 


(& CHORUS)  


Do you need anybody?  I need somebody to love   
Could it be anybody?  I want somebody to love.  
Would you believe in a love at first sight? 
Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time   
What do you see when you turn out the light?
I can't tell you but I know it's mine.  


(& CHORUS)  


Yes, I get by with a little help from my friends
With a little help from my friends. 


.   
                  Words 


Smile an everlasting smile  
Cause smile could bring you near to me  
Don't ever let me find you're gone  
Cause that would bring a tear to me 
This world has lost its glory   
Let's start a brand new story now, my love  
Right now, there'll be no other time
And I can't show you how, my love.  


Talk in everlasting words   
And dedicate them all to me 
And I will give you all my life 
I'm here if you should call to me   
You think that I don't even mean    
A single word I say.


It's only words, and words are all I have   
To take your heart away. (x 2)

                  Yellow Submarine  


In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea   
And he told us of his life  
In the land of submarines   
So we sailed up to the sun  
Till we found the sea of green  
And we lived beneath the waves  
In our yellow submarine.


CHORUS:  We all live in a yellow submarine  
A yellow submarine, a yellow submarine. (x 2)   


And our friends are all aboard  
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play.


(& CHORUS)  


As we live a life of ease   
Every one of us has all we need 
Sky of blue and sea of green
In our yellow submarine.


(& CHORUS)  


.   
                  Yesterday 


Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away   
Now it looks as though they're here to stay 
Oh, I believe in yesterday  
Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be 
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly.


Why she had to go, I don't know 
She wouldn't say
I said something wrong  
Now I long for yesterday.   


Yesterday, love was such and easy game to play  
Now I need a place to hide away 
Oh, I believe in yesterday  
Mm, mm...   


.   
                  You Are My Sunshine   


CHORUS:  You are my sunshine, my only sunshine  
You make me happy when skies are grey   
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away. 


The other night, dear, as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms 
When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken  
And I hung my head and cried.   


(& CHORUS)  


I'll always love you and make you happy 
If you will only say the same   
But if you leave me to love another 
You'll regret it all some day.  


(& CHORUS)  


.   
                  Your Song 


It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money but, boy, if I did  
I'd buy a big house where we both could live.   


If I were a sculptor, but then again no 
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show  
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do 
My gift is my song and this one's for you.  


CHORUS:  And you can tell everybody this is your song   
It may be quite simple but, now that it's done  
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world.


I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss   
Well, a few of the verses, well they've got me quite cross  
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song   
It's for people like you that keep it turned on.


So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do  
You see, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is what I really mean 
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen. 


(& CHORUS)  


I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words    
How wonderful life is while you're in the world.
