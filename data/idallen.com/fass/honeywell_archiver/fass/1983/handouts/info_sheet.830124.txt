Hey there, actors/singers/dancers/etc.!  Although we don't really   

get into producing the show until auditions during the first week of
January, we'd like to know of any special talents you might like to 
employ in the show, like tap-dancing, juggling, gymnastics, playing 
musical instruments, singing, etc.  This way, if you're 
sure to be in the show, we can plan to include these things in the  
script.  So, please describe here anything special you'd like to do 
in the show:

Okay, so you don't want to act.  Or perhaps you want to act, but
want to do something more, too.  How about the technical side of the
show?  Tech work starts in the winter   
term, so if you are interested in any of the things listed below,   
please check them off.  Please feel free to add explanations of any 
training and/or experience you have in these areas:

Now for the important stuff: PARTIES!!  Do you live in a place that 
could hold a party of   
.nf 
__ 20   __ 30   __ 40   __ 50   __ 60+  people? 
Would you be willing to host such a party?  __ yes   __ no  
.fi 
Of course, FASS would supply the munchies and such, but we do need  
party places.  Are you interested in helping Terry the vice-president   
to organize parties?    
.nf 
__ yes sirree!    __ nope   
.fi 
Please keep in mind that there isn't much partying done until the   
winter term.

meetings, the coffeehouse, and of course at auditions in January '83!   
Have a good time at the party tonight, and feel free to ask 
any of us about anything.  Thanks again!
