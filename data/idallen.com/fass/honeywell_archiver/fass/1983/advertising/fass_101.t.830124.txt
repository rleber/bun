In an emergency meeting of the UW senate and the Board of Directors,
neither of which took place, a motion was passed making a new Winter
term course \f2COMPULSORY\fP for \f2ALL\fP undergraduate students,  
graduate students, faculty members, staff, and administration,  
both on-campus and off.

Due to a gross oversight by university officials, the following 
entry is conspicuously and quite rightly missing from the 1982-83   
Undergraduate and Graduate Calendars.

A funny, musical, satirical, satyrical, boisterous introduction to  
life at the University of Waterloo, as seen through the eyes of 
the University's own FASS Theatre Company.

The course will be taught by about fifty enthusiastic instructors,  
in what must be the most severe abuse of ``team teaching'' this 
side of Guelph. 
.sp 0.5v
A partial list of   
topics to be covered include Ancient\ Rome, in the words of 
Johnny\ Carson; 
the Emerald\ City, in the words of Marvin the Paranoid Tin\ Man;
the Starship\ Enterprise, in the words of James\ Bond;  
and Sherwood\ Forest, in the words of your favourite Valley\ Girl.

Persons attending lectures should ensure that their library fines are   
paid up.

So whether you are an old FASSite or a  
starting-this-year-er, whether on-campus or flying in from that Whitehorse  
work term, FASS '83 guarantees you'll make the grade (we get the credit 
though).  Just to make things more difficult, this compulsory course has very   
limited class sizes so register SOON.  The registrar's office has been moved
to the Humanities Box Office to handle the rush.  See you at FASS '83!
