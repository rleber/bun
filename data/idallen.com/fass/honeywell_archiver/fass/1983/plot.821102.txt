THE PLOT
.sp 
.ce 
.ul 
Act One 
I,0:  The Great Librarian decides to have a party and invites both  
real people and characters from books.  But, he accidentally doesn't
invite Mary Poppins. She gets terribly pissed off and decides to
send everybody back into the wrong books.  Thus, many real people,  
including the Great Librarian get sent into books, many characters  
wind up in the wrong books, and some characters are left in the 
real world. 
.sp 
I,1:  Inside The Wizard Of Oz.  Glinda is not present, so the evil  
witches are having a field day.  Also, Student A, Student B, and
(you guessed it.!) Student C are in this book.  They find being in  
The Wizard of Oz a real downer, so decide to leave the book.  They  
click their heels together three times, and are back in the library.
.sp 
I,2:  The 3 students from Oz, and 6 characters who have been left   
out of their books -- James Bond, Peter Pan, Frankenstein's 
monster, Glinda the Good Witch of the North, The Lone Ranger, and   
Watson -- meet in the library.  They decide that the only solution  
is to try to find the Great Librarian who can undoubtedly set   
things right.  Student A discovers a Star Trek communicator and 
jokingly says "Library to Enterprize -- 3 to beam up."  She, the
Lone Ranger and Watson all disappear to everyone's surprize.
.sp 
I,3:  On board the Enterprize.  The Lone Ranger, Watson and Student A   
discover that Spock's tricorder was set to record everything, and, so   
would probably have on it where the Great Librarian was sent.  There is 
only one problem -- his tricorder was stolen by the Sherrif of Nottingham.  
Student A uses her communicator to get a message back to the library
crowd that they should look in Robin Hood where the Sherrif will likely 
have Spock's tricorder. 
.sp 
I,4:  Student B, James Bond, and Peter Pan are in Sherwood Forest.  They
try to get Spock's tricorder from the Sherrif of Nottingham.  Eventually
they succeed, and see that the Great Librarian was sent into Julius Caesar. 
(It may make for better surprize in I,5 if they only see a Dewey decimal
# or Library of Congress #.)  They use the communicator which they brought  
along to tell the remaining library crowd that G.L is in Julius Caesar. 
.sp 
Between scenes (sort of):  Mary Poppins hears that some good guys are   
going into J.C. to find the G.L.  She decides to go there too in order  
to kill the G.L.
.sp 
I,5:  Student C, Frankenstein's monster and Glinda are in Julius Caesar.
They try to get a hold of the G.L. who is playing the part of Caesar.   
They finally get to him, only to see him killed by Mary Poppins.  He    
dies with the words "Act Two, Brute".   
.sp

.ul 
Act Two 
II,1:  Mary Poppins rejoices that the G.L is dead.  Now she can do  
whatever evil things she wants.  She calles an evil summit with all 
of the baddies from all of the books.  They do something (build a   
machine, perhaps) that will cause complete chaos in the books.  
(This scene takes place in Mary Poppins' nursery.)  
.sp 
II,2:  On board the Enterprize.  Now that the baddies have decided  
to create chaos, all hell is breaking loose.  Characters are being  
replaced left and right.  Over the communicator, comes the voice of 
Student C who says that G.L. has been killed and now they will have 
to come up with a solution themselves.  Spock suggests that they    
attempt to rewrite the books in order to set things right.  
.sp 
II,3:  In the Library.  The good characters try to rewrite the  
books themselves.  They eventually decide that this is much too 
slow.  If they want to do it properly, they will need an infinite   
number of monkeys who can write every book ever written.  They  
assemble such a set of monkeys.  The output of the first one has
10 words of sense then Gazornonplatz and garbage.  The second one   
has 5 words of sense and then Gazornonplatz, garbage.  The third
one has only 2 words of sense, then Gazornonplatz,garbage.  The 
fourth is FASS '83.  They read in there that they went (will go?)   
into the Great Index in search of The Great Gazornonplatz, garbage. 
.sp 
II,4:  In Mary Poppins' nursery.  Evil production number.  The evil 
characters learn from their spy that the good guys are going into   
the Great Index in search of The Great Gazornonplatz.  They decide  
to go as well, because they don't want on of the good guys to get   
the Great Gazornonplatz and become the new G.L. 
.sp 
II,5:  Inside the Great Index.  The good guys wander through the index. 
Eventually, they come to a giant book with a giant bookmark in it.  It  
bears the inscription, "He who can remove the bookmark from this book   
shall be the next Great Librarian.".  Trumpets blare, choirs of angels  
sing, they pass by it.  They wander past it again (trumpets, choir, etc.)   
and notice it this time.  Each of them tries to pull the bookmark from  
the book and fails.  They give up.  The bad guys wander past, and each one  
tries and fails to remove it.  (Of course, Mary Poppins' incredibly-low-
status-assistant doesn't even try.)  Mary starts looking through her
books to try to find a way to remove the bookmark.  She asks her assis- 
tant for a bookmark and he pulls the Bookmark from the Book with absolutely 
no effort.  He now has the power to repay Mary for her unending cruelty 
to him, and does so.  As the new Great Librarian, he sets everything
right again.

CHARACTERS  
.sp 
Mary Poppins:  bitchy, prim + proper, strong, quite evil.   
.sp 
Her assistant:  Math hack.  He's doing this as a co-op job.  (insert
obligatory Co-op jokes here)  He's a Woody Allen-like frosh.  Easily
pushed around, but basically good inside.   
.sp 
James Bond:  as in the movies and books.

.sp 
Peter Pan:  a child that never grew up.  (This is a male part that is   
traditionally played by a female actor, because it calls for a someone  
who can speak in a high voice and jump around a lot.)   
.sp 
Lone Ranger:  as in the movies. 
.sp 
Watson:  as in the movies and books.
.sp 
Frankenstein's monster:  not quite as nasty as before -- he's been in   
group therapy for a couple of years.
.sp 
Glinda:  seductive Swedish type 
.sp 
Great Librarian:  good, wise, kind, Gandalf-like, maybe a little too
trusting, totally incapable of any cruelty or evil. 
.sp 
Student A:  Female biology student (that's a female who studies biology,
not a person who studies female biology), smart and has a very sharp
wit.
.sp 
Student B:  Female arts student, classic artsie airhead stereotype. 
.sp 
Student C:  Male engineering student, stereotypical beer-drinking,  
ignorant engineer.   Probably likes sheep.

NOTE:  IF YOU PLAN TO PUT YOUR SCENE ONTO THE HONEYWELL IN THE FASS 
ACCOUNT, THERE IS SOME IMPORTANT INFORMATION YOU WILL NEED ON TF,   
FASS MACROS, ETC.  YOU CAN GET IT FROM IAN! ALLEN IN MC3045 STARTING
SOMETIME TOMORROW.  IF HE'S NOT IN HIS OFFICE, THE STUFF MAY BE ON  
HIS DOOR.  Also, when you get into the FASS account, you should type
in   setc fass/1983  to the first '*' prompt.  You can then read your   
scene file.  (You would type in r /2-3 to read the Act II Scene 3 file, 
for example.)  If you run into any desperate problems when you're   
typing in your scene, a mail message to 'idallen' or 'jagardner' may
get you some assistance.  (Almost any mistake can be undone, if you 
know how to undo it.)
