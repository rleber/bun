THE PLOT (THE WHAT???)  
.sp 
.ce 
.ul 
Act One 
I,0:  The Great Librarian decides to have a party   
     and invites both real people and characters
     from books.  But, he accidentally doesn't  
     invite one person.  This person gets very  
     angry and becomes our Evil One.  Evil One  
     decides to send everyone back into the 
    wrong books.  Thus many real people, including  
    the Great Librarian get sent into books, many   
    charactes wind up in the wrong books, and some  
    characters are left in the real world.  
I,1:  Inside one screwed up book
I,2:  In the library.  Characters (and real people?)
   meet and decide that the only solution is to find
   the Great Librarian who can set things right.
   They split into three books. 
I,3:  One group of questers, in one book.   
I,4:  Another group of questers in another book.
I,5:  A third group of questers in yet another book.
   But, the Great Librarian is really in this book. 
   He is being held in a prison.  The characters    
   mount a rescue operation.  They retreive the 
   Great Librarian and he will now be able to set   
   things right, but the Evil One is one of the 
   members of the party, and he kills the Great 
   Librarian.  The Great Librarian dies, possibly   
   with the words "Act Two, Brute"  
.sp 
.ce 
.ul 
Act Two 
II,1:  The Evil One and his assistant rejoice at
     the Great Librarian's death.  Now, they will   
     be able to perform all the evil deeds they 
     want.  They call a meeting of all evil characters  
     from books, and together plot what evil things 
     they will do.  
II,2:  The good characters who had been questing
    for the Great Librarian meet.  Now they will    
    have to do something themselves.  They decide   
    to try to physically remove characters from 
    books, but this doesn't work.  Some characters  
    don't want to leave.
II,3:  The good characters try to rewrite the   
    books themselves, but this is much too slow.
    One of them reasons that an infinite number 
    of monkeys could type up every book ever
    written, so they get an infinite number of  
    monkeys and start them typing off stage.  The   
    first monkey's output has ten intelligible  
    words and then nonsense.  The second monkey's   
    output only makes sense for 5 words.  The   
    third monkey's output only makes sense for  
    2 words.  The fourth monkey's output is FASS
    '83.  The characters see in the script that 
    they should go into the giant index where   
    they'll find the Great Bookmark, the bearer 
    of which will become the new Great Librarian.   
II,4:  The evil characters have had a spy in the    
    good guys.  From him, they learn that the good  
    guys are going into the index to try to become  
    a new Great Librarian.  They realize that a 
    new Great Librarian would ruin all of their 
    evil plans, so they decide to go into the index 
    as well, and get the bookmark for themselves.   
II,5:  The good guys wander through the index.  
    Eventually they come to a giant book, with a
    giant bookmark in it and the inscription "He
    who can remove the bookmark from this book  
    shall be the next Great Librarian."  Trumpets   
    blare, choirs of angels sing, they don't notice.
    They wander past it again (trumpets, angels, etc.)  
     and this time they notice it.  Each of them
    tries to pull the bookmark from the book unsuc- 
    cessfully.  They give up.  The bad guys try to  
    remove the bookmark, all of them unsuccessfully.
    (Of course, the Evil One's incredibly-low-status-   
    assistant doesn't even try.)  The Evil One starts   
    looking through his books to see if he can find 
    any clue as to how to remove the bookmark.  He  
    asks his assistant for a bookmark, and the  
    assistant removes the Great Bookmark with no
    effort.  He now has the power to get back at
    his Evil boss, and does so.  He sets the whole  
    world right, and they all live happily ever 
    after.  (Except, to keep Brian happy, we leave  
    one little thing unresolved.
