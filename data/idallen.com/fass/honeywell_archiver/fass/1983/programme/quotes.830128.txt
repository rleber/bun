``[FASS 1975's The Peasants' Revolt] was blatantly sexist, intellectually   
bankrupt -- with the multitude of cliches, and most of all the peasants lost
the revolt, which is contradicted with the success students are having in   
Quebec, and hopefully in Ontario, in opposing oppressive measures against   
the students.''

``Like Johnny Carson, FASS seems to be able to pick out the sacred cows of  
the society we inhabit and exhibit them for public and healthy laughter.''

``FASS is a four letter word that starts with `F' and means the most fun
