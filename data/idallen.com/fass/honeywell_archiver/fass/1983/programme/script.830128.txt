Even now, I find it hard to believe that the script is actually 
completed.  It all started in the summer with some crazy brainstorming  
and ended in a series of frantic December editing sessions.  Somehow,   
out of all this chaos, a script emerged.

It would be impossible to thank individually all of the people  
who helped me out.  But, I'd like to give special thanks to Jim and 
Linda for their cooperation, Ian! for his work on the computer, and,
of course, Bernie, without whom I could never have done it.

One final note: some of the funniest stuff you see tonight was  
written by people who had never written for FASS before.  So, come  
help us write next year's show.  It's a lot of fun!
