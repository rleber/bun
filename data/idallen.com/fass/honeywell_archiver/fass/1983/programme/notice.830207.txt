You can't smoke in the theatre because the fire marshal doesn't want
to be responsible if you get lung cancer.  You can't eat or drink   
refreshments in the theatre because the theatre management doesn't  
want to contribute to anyone's obesity.  You can't use cameras  
during the performance lest you disturb the Gzorninplatz.   
You can't use a tape recorder either, the   
script is copyrighted by the people \f2we\f1 stole it from. 
Thank you for observing these rules.
Violators will be fined and have their borrowing privileges revoked.
