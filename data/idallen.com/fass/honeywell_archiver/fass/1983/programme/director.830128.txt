Message From Our Director   
.HE

.ti 2m  
Welcome to FASS.
.ti 2m  
While I don't want to sound selfish, the show tonight is
as much for \f2us\f1 as it is for you.  
If you want to check, just watch how much fun we're having on stage.
We've enjoyed putting it together;  
I invite all of you to enjoy it, too!

I owe more thanks than I have buttons. The following names  
leap to mind immediately:   
the Celebrity Janitors (you know who you are), for spirit   
and enthusiasm, but mostly for saying "Yes";
John W. Bast, for audition forms, calendars and the 
colourful and original invectives that got me through the days; 
Bernie Roehl, for scripts;  
Meryn Cadell, for making it all look so easy that no one noticed
it was new and different;   
Kelly Booth, for his forgiveness and, indirectly, financial aid;
Carol Lynch & Brenz Parsons, for saying "We'll try" instead of "No";
Steve Hutton, for a script with room for lots of talent;
Jim Gardner, for being more than just your average musical director;





my cast, crew and production staff, for taking it all in stride, and
making me proud;
and, finally, Ross Gibaut, for everything.
