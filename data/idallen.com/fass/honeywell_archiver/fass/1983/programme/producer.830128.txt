As producer of this year's production of FASS, I have learned a lot!
I have learned about people, production and theatre.  I can safely say  
that the FASS Theatre Company is a unique and dedicated group of
theatre lovers.  The time, energy and imagination of all the people 
involved in this year's show comes to a peak this evening.  You, the
audience, will decide through your laughter, applause and interest whether  
the long hours of preparation have been worthwhile.

Somehow, possibly from advertisement, rumour or coaxing, you have   
found yourself in the Humanities Theatre waiting for the 21\ust\d annual
FASS  production entitled FASS OR FICTION.  Needless to say, for whatever   
reason you have, we thank you.  This time last year, many of the cast   
and crew were in your position -- watching the show.  As their interest 
spurred them to get involved, you too can begin to plan for next
year's show by joining our group.  Just look for posters or articles








which will tell you when, where and how to get involved.  It's very easy    
and FASS will welcome every one of you with open arms.

Sit back, relax, and enjoy the show.  We are here to entertain you, 
so bring down the lights, bring up the curtain, bring on the    
actors -- it's show time, folks!
