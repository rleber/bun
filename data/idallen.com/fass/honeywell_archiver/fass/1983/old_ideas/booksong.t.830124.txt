.zz Don't ya just **love** Manilow  
We will be here forever 
Rewriting all of the books. 
We put the plots and the characters together
We are monkeys, and we write the books.

We wrote each story by Mark Twain, today.   
We have to redo every Neil Simon Play.  
We get no royalties - it makes us cry.  
We write the books, we write the books

Old Shaw was truly crazy,   
Drown that old man in the sea.  
And as for Shakespeare, he would fail,  
if your forced him to write ELP.
.ve 4   
We do romances they call Harlequin. 
But only after drinking bottles of gin. 
For science-fiction we insist on rye.   
We write the books, we write the books.

Al Hailey was a hack, Kunta Kinte wasn't black. 
And it is a mystery why Rhomer sells.   
Bronte was a tart, Charles Dickens was just a fart. 
But for you, for no fee, we will write them you see.
It's a big con-spiracy! 
.ve 4   
We write the books about near everything.   
Our books taught Barry Manilow to sing.  (Doesn't scan but worth it)
Our books can make you laugh or make you cry.   
We write the books we write the books.  
.ve 1   
We are monkeys, and we write the books!
