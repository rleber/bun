.ve 6   
(HOOK:) It's astounding 
(DARTH VADER:) Books are changing   
(HITLER:) Chaos takes control   
(MATA HARI:) So let me tell you 
My intentions are evil  
Destruction is my goal  
.ve 5   
I remember  
Doing the Book Warp 
Setting the power high  
The books all were altered  
And we all started saying   
.ve 2   
Let's do the Book Warp again!   
Let's do the Book Warp again!   
.ve 7   
CHORUS: 
It's just a chapter ahead   
And then a page to the right
As you play with the dial   
The plot goes out of sight. 
But it's the char'cter switch   
That really drives books insane 
.ve 2   
Let's do the Book Warp again!   
Let's do the Book Warp again!   
.ve 12  
I'm ecstatic
It's simply fantastic   
Books are erratic   
It's so insane. 
We take people from oone book   
And put them into another   
Where they all will lose their minds
So to Merchant of Venice
We add Dennis the Menace
And Hamlet will never be the same   
So there's utter confusion  
And it's not an illusion

MARY:   

Once I was looking after kids   
Bein' a real nice girl  
When the Library guy said it was party time 
So he sent the call 
To everyone but me  
And I was so fed up 
I said "Golly gee   
I'll show that creep
Not to treat me right   
Now I'm evil
And it sure feels right 
.ve 1   
(CHORUS REPEATS)
