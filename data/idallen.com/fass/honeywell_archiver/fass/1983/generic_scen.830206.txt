(VOICE OVER)
Ladies and gentlemen, we regret 
to announce at this time that, due to the   
traditional failure of Act II Scene 3 to    
either advance the plot or provide outstanding  
yucks , II:3 will not appear
in this year's show. The plot will proceed  
directly to Act II Scene 4. In the meantime, we 
present a generic F.A.S.S. scene, complete in   
every way but totally unrelated to this, or any,
show.   
.ch tt  
Where am I? 
I seem to have been mysteriously transported
from my peaceful beer-brewing university town.  
.ch na  
(DEEPLY AND MYSTERIOUSLY, OF COURSE)
You have entered...the Trilight Zone.

.ch hb  
Well, since we're obviously total strangers, let's  
introduce ourselves to one another, and save the    
audience having to check the program for puns in our


names.  
.ch tt  
I'm Tess Tease, a feather-headed arts student with  
fruit loops where my brain should be, and a 
mistaken idea that tucking my leg-warmers into my   
low-cut pirate boots makes them look less like  
an affectation aand more like they perform some 
practical function. 
.ch pa  
I'm Peter Ast, a beer-bellied engineer cast for my ability  
to burp on cue and no known allergies to lanolin. I am  
never described as the "butt" of jokes, for obvious reasons.
.ch hb  
I'm Hugh Briss, the sellf-righteous mathie with more
brains than clothes sense. I wrote this show, so while I
may not be aa fashion plate, you'll never see me say    
anything stupid or have objectionable relationships with
animals. I will often appear to have the solution to our
dilemmas until some offbeat burbling of my compatriots sparks   
the true resolution.
.xx ALL 
And we can't help feeling that our life is without purpose.

What was that?  
.ch tt  
It's a bird!
.ch pa  
It's a plane!   
.ch hb  
It's an opening ploy!   
Legend has it that the elusive F.A.S.S. opening ploy can    
only be captured by a virgin.

AGAIN" STYLE)

But we need 
.ul 
something   
to quest for!   
.ch hb  
Applause?   
.ch tt  
I've got an idea -- let's spontaneously burst into song!
.sb "Generic FASS Song" "The Rainbow Connection"
Why are there so many   
Songs in a FASS show
And why are they all so blah?   
They may be stolen  
From Broadway or movies.
We know it's against the law.   
.ve 4   
Someday they'll find us, the copyright people.  
They will complain to the cops. 
Then they'll commit us to penal correction  
And they will impound all our props.
.ch hb  
It was an idea. 
.ad 
(OR, IF THEY APPLAUD:)

Well, it's a start. 
.ch pa  
A joke, we need a joke! Writer!!

Some people have all the luck.

(SUDDENLY THEY ARE INTERRUPTED BY LOTS OF FLASHY SPECIAL
EFFECT, SPECTACULAR BUT CHEAP AND EASY. SUGGESTIONS ARE 
FLASHING LIGHTS, FLASH POTS, SIRENS, CRASHES AND FINALLY
AND ANGELIC CHORUS, A LA BRAD'S HOLY GRAIL IN II:5) 
.ch pa  
I have a solution.  
.ch tt  
How can you tell?   
.ch pa  
Didn't you see all the special effects?

Well?

Oh! You wanna know

how 
we get out of this!

SILENTLY AND DRAMATICALLY.  
THEN THEY SIGNAL TO LIGHTING BOOTH THAT THEIR AREA  
LIGHTS GO DOWN AND LIGHTS COME UP ON TWO OTHER AREAS.)

SPEAKING INTO A STANDUP MIKE)   
.ch ra  
This has been a test of the emergency joke system.  
If this had been a real scene, you would have   
laughed and applauded wildly. We now return to  
the regularly scheduled plot.   
This is 
.ul 
not 
a test. This is a real scene. You may laugh 
at this. I repeat, this is not a test.
