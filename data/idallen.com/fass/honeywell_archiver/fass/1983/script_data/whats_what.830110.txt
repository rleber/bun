Brief descriptions of some of the files under this catalog :


    major_chars 
       (a list of all major characters, the scenes they're in   
        and the songs they sing)
    minor_chars 
       (a list of all minor characters, organized by scene and giving   
        what songs they sing, if any)   
    song_list   
       (a list of songs by scene, giving singers for each)  


    alpha_list  
      (alphabetical list of characters with song level and scenes)  


A "minor" character is one who appears in only one scene; a "major" 
character appears in two or more scenes.

Note that the files have tabs in them, and so are much more readable if 
you use the 'p' command instead of the 'l' command. (In other words,
                     p /song_list
