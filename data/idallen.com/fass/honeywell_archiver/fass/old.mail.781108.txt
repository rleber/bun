BERNIE: 
When you get a chance, you ought to freeze the stuff under fass/skit into   
one file, and write cruns or druns (freeze these too!) to extract and roff  
the skit. Make sure that the cruns and druns will work under anyone's account - 
i.e. don't refer to permfiles in the roff command line! (unfreezing files   
means you get temp files anyway...).
We shall have to worry soon about space in the account. 
I will get rid of my stuff soon. (fass/idallen stuff)

Conservationists:   
 Are you aware that we have an endangered species?? Yes 
it's called a "Nit", (folious woolius). It seems that so
many people have started Nit- picking, and now this species 
is coming extinct. because: If there is one thing a Nit 
can't stand is to be picked all the time. This animal is a  
semi-plant, and if you pick one, it won't reroot, therebye  
diying. 
 Let's get together and get this poor creature onto the 
endangered species list!!   
 Thank-you, E. A. MacNEIL

To rewrite mail, see pstachour. 
Mail will not handle AFT files or catalogues (or catalogs). 
What you have to do is copy the mail.box of the current userid to a 
safe place, and then copy in the mail.box you want mail to use.

What do you mean a heading? 
40 idallen Wed Oct 18 1978 20:57
Wrong. Mail is always sent from your userid, or assumed userid. 
"NOTES" can be left with any heading, in the mail.box you are currently in. 
e.g.
% mail  
+u fass 

1 message waiting   
+n rocky.horror 
.This is a note to myself.

Hi, Jim. I tried setting margins m3 and m4 to 0 and 2 respectively, which   
seemed to help a little (36 pgs). Still a lot of blank space...will now 
try reducing the .ne for characters from 6 to 4, thus ensuring at least 
two lines of a character's speech (and two accompanying blank lines) to be  
placed at the bottom of a page. 
 --Bernie   
12 to jim Wed Oct 25 1978 0:56 M
Just roffed it into a file and checked the last page number : 33 !  
the ne 6 becoming ne 4 helped that extra little bit. I haven't checked  
to see how things look in terms of single lines at bottoms of pages (in 
theory, there shouldn't be any) but at least the script seems shorter.  
 --Bernie (again)   
13 too jim Wed Oct 25 1978 0:58 M   
the file roff7 contains the 33-page version. Note that I have not yt
corrected typos nor added the Observer's entrance.  
 --Bernie (last time tonight)   
14 to jim Wed Oct 25 1978 12:07 M   
Hi. The typos have now been fixed and the Observer's speech added. The modified 
source is now in fass/eclipse6 (I didn't have room for a roffed version of it,  
but it doesn't take long to roff ( <= 1.5 minutes ). It's still under 33 pages. 
I'll be home by 6:00 and will be in all night (886-4867) if Marilyn has any 
questions, comments, pleas or demands.

Hi, Jim. The script is now in fass/eclipse, with the expanded version in

1) you are on the to-be-hired list. We have not concluded agreements with   
the publisher to ensure that UW gets some money out of this, so 
I cant sign you up just yet.
2) You would be paid the median salary for Co-op students in your term. 
This would be prorated on the time you worked on the
project.
3) Hopefully the contract would be settled by end of Nov, conincident with  
first pay period. so end of Nov.
4) I am person to formalize 1-3.
5) Working hours are flexible, but expect they will be determined by you
as there is sufficient work to keep you busy.   
6) account for hours on daily basis 
7) I can arrange idallen survives during this time, although the editing
work will be done under another userid for the contract work.
