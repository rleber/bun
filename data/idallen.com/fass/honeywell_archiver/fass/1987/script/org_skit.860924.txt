(THE SCENE OPENS WITH ALL CHARACTERS ONSTAGE,   
SINGING THE OPENING SONG.)  
.sb "Opening Song" "The Ballad of Gilligan's Isle"  
.ve 5   
Just sit right back while we sing about 
A group twenty-five years old,  
With tacky play, and stupid jokes,  
And actors all quite bold.  
     (Or so we have been told.) 
.ve 5   
The cast is an eager, rag-tag lot,  
The techies, brave and pure;
One hundred oor more come each year 
Drawn to the stage's lure.  
     (Though why, we aren't quite sure.)
.ve 5   
The play is the thing, or so we say,
All schoolwork cast aside;  
Just jion up now and you will see:  
Your marks will start to slide. 
     (A roller-coaster ride.)   
.ve 9   
The show this year's amid T of A's  
Narrow and dim-lit aisles;  
With eagerness  
The cast and crew   
Will meet and put   
On a play.  
All of them stars   
Better than you'll see on TV
Everyone with a smile!  
.ad 
(AS THE SNG ENDS, MOST OF THE CAST WANDERS OFF, 
LEAVING ONLY THE PROFESSOR AND THE SKIPPER ON STAGE.)   
.ch sk  
So, Professor, what you're saying is that we can use
those coconut shells you've been collecting 
and a few parts from the radio  
to develop a crude faster-than-light drive  
that can get us off the island! 
.ch pr  
Yes, that's right, Skipper. 
As soon as Gilligan brings me the last of those 
very fragile radio parts I need, we'll...   
.sd 
(SOUNDS FROM STAGE LEFT,
AS OF VERY FRAGILE RADIO PARTS  CEASING TO BE.  
ENTER GILLIGAN FROM STAGE LEFT, RUNNING.)   
.ch gi  
Skipper! Skipper!!  
.ch sk  
What is it, little buddy?   
.ch gi  
There's a moat in the balloon!  
I mean a goat in the baboon!
I mean...   
.ch pr  
Calm down, Gilligan.
What I think you're trying to say is
that there's a boat in the lagoon.  
.ch gi  
Right.  There's a boat in the lagoon.   
.ch sk  
There now, that wasn't so hard to say, was  
- (DOUBLE TAKE) -   y jua bo

a boat in the lagoon!   
I can't believe it! 
.ch pr  
Neither can I.  
We normally average only two boats in the   
lagoon a week.  
This makes the fourth in five days. 
.ch sk  
I'll go get the others. 
You two see who's on that boat. 
.ad 
(LOUD FANFARE FROM STAGE LEFT,  
AS THE EVIL DOCTOR FASSTUS ENTERS.  
THE REST OF THE CASTAWAYS ARE IN A ROW BEHIND HIM, ZOMBIE-LIKE. 
WHEN THE OTHER CASTAWAYS SPEAK IT WILL BE AS ONE
ZOMBIE-LIKE UNIT.)  
.ch df  
There is noo need for that! 
.ch gi  
Okay then,  
.ul 
I'll
get the others and  
.ul 
you all see who's on the boat.  
.ch sk  
Shut up, Gilligan.  
.ch pr  
Who are you?
And what have you done to Ginger, Mary-Ann and the Howes?   
.ch df  
The young ladies are under my hypnotic control. 
The Howes are also my slaves, except for Gordie,
who retired from pro hockey some years ago. 
As for your first question, 
I am The Evil Doctor FASStus!   
.ch gi  
Doctor FASStus? 
.ch df  
No, you fools, "The Evil Doctor FASStus"!   
Get it straight!
.ad 
(THE HYPNOTIZED CASTAWAYS VISIBLY STRAIGHTEN THEIR LINE.)   
.ex 
Not 
.ul 
you 
fools.

Those   
fools.  
.xx OTHER~CASTAWAYS 
Oh. Sorry.  
.ch sk  
But what do you want here?  
.ad 
(FASSTUS SNAPS HIS FINGERS. 
GINGER AND MARY-ANN STEP UP TO EITHER SIDE OF HIM.) 
.ex 
Oh, I see.  
Thank you.  
(DOUBLE TAKE)   
Now hold on a second!   
This is a family show - seven castaways 
and their adventures on a mysterious island.
.ch df  
You mean you don't know where you are!? 
.ch pr  
No.  The only clue we have is some sort of  
proimative tribal chanting we hear occasionally.  Listen.   
.sd 
(FROM OFFSTAGE WE FAINTLY HEAR THE FIRST FEW LINES OF "I'SE THE B'Y".)  
.ex 
Any ideas?  
.ch df  
You don't want to know. 
Now if you'll excuse me,
I must procede with my plan for global domination!  
.ch gi  
Can we watch?   
.ch sk  
Shut up, Gilligan.  
What are you going to do?   
.ch df  
I am going to sacrifice hese four   
(INDICATING THE OTHER CASTAWAYS)
to the dark one, that I might obtain unspeakable power. 
After a traditional rite of drinking and debauchery,
they will lose their souls forever! 
.ch pr  
Sounds a bit like Octoberfest.  
.ch of  
(FROMM OFFSTAGE RIGHT)  
Octoberfest!  Then I've found it!   
.ad 
(ENTER OTTO FASSBINDER FROM STAGE RIGHT.)   
.ch gi  
Whoo's he?  
.ch sk  
Shut up, Gilligan.  
I'll handel this.   
(TO FASSBINDER) Who are you?
.ch of  
I am the great director, Otto FASSbinder!   
.ch sk  
Well, I'm the Skipper   
.ch gi  
And I'm Gilligan.   
.ch pr  
And I'm the Professor, and the rest of our party
is standing behind Doctor FASStus there.
.ch df  
That's "The Evil Doctor FASStus"!   
I say again, get it straight
.ad 
(ONCE AGAIN, THE ZOMBIE CASTAWAYS TRY TO STRAIGHTEN THEIR LINE, 
BUT FASSTUS INTERUPTS THEIR EFFORT WITH:)   
.ex 
Don't even think it.
.xx OTHER~CASTAWAYS 
Wouldn't dream of it,   
O Load and Master.  
.ch pr

Are you here to take part in FASStus'...
.ch df  
That's "The Evil... 
.ch pr  
Whatever!   
Are you here to take part in
.ul 
his 
rite of drunkenness and debauchery too? 
.ch of  
Oh, ya! 
A truly good Fassnacht is so hard to find anymore - I   
certainly intend to enjoy this one! 
.ch gi  
Fassnacht?  Is that what they call an attempt   
to take over the universe?  
.ch of  
No, no. 
A Fassnacht is an old German tradition - one huge   KE) party just p

party just prior to the religious season of Lent.   
The word itself is derived from 'night', 'nacht', and   
'barrel' or 'keg', 'fass'!  
.ch fd  
(FROM OFFSTAGE LEFT)
FASS! Then I've found it!   
.ad 
(ENTER DIRECTOR FROM STAGE LEFT.)   
.ex 
Right.  So, what are we all standing around for?
I want the cast assembled here in five minutes! 
.ch of  
Uh... I think we have a little bit of confusion here.   
.ch df  
.ul 
You 
should talk.
.xx OTHER~CASTAWAYS 
You tell 'im, O Lord and Master.
.ch fd  
O...kay.
You mean this isn't where FASS is?  
.ch df  
This is where The Evil Doctor FASStus is.   
.ch of  
Und this is where we are going to have a Fassnacht. 
.ch fd  
But nor FASS, the University of Waterloo's annual   
musical/comedy, put on by a talented assortment 
of amateur performers to capacity crowds?   
.ch df  
No. 
.xx OTHER~CASTAWAYS 
Aw, come on, The Evil Doctor FASStus!   
.ch df  
Absolutely not. 
.xx OTHER~CASTAWAYS 
Awww... 
.ch fd  
Who are you guys?   
.xx OTHER~CASTAWAYS 
We are zombies, thank you for asking.   
.ch sk

(POINTING)  
He's the Skipper,   
he's Gilligan, he's the Professor, they are my zombies, 
he is Otto FASSbinder, you are apparently the director of FASS, 
and I am Doctor FASStus!
.xx ALL~EXCEPT~FASSTUS  
That's The Evil Doctor FASStus! 
.ch df  
Arrgggh!
Right, just for that -  
.ul 
no  
rite of drunkenness and debauchery! 
.ad 
(EVERYONE GROANS, SAYS 'AWW', WHATEVER.)
.ch gi  
Well, what are we going to do now?  
.ch fd  
How about a two-and-a-half hour extravaganza,   
with fantastic technical effects,   
to be put on in February?   
ch of   
Und I could direct! 
.ch fd  
Uh...we'll talk about that later, Otto. 
.ch gi  
We could have Ginger coach the actors...
.ch pr  
And I could work up some technical effects...   
.ch df  
And I could take over the universe! 
.xx OTHER~CASTAWAYS 
Oh, lay off it, Doc!
.ch df  
That's The Evil... Oh, the heck with it.
Call me Fred.   
.ch sk  
QUIET, PLEASE!  
.xx ALL~EXCEPT~SKIPPER  
Thank you.  
.ch fd  
That's the spirit!  
Now what we need is a good song...  
.ch gi  
For an opening song?
.ch fd  
Actually, for a closing song!   
.ad
