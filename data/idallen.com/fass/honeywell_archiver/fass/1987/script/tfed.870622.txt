13-A.S.M.:  He's at the Grad Club.

   gone wrong.

18-A.S.M.:   Oh  yeah?   What  about  the  explosion  at the
   beginning of Act 1?

30-A.S.M.:   This  wouldn't  happen  if  we  were better or-
   ganized. 


31-EFFECTS:  It's all Keith's fault.


32-SOUND:  No way! Cecilia's responsible.   


33-A.S.M.:  You're both wrong. Our problems all  started  at
   the General Meeting.

        STU: It's distressing,  
             And somewhat depressing,   
             That we can't write anything new.  





      SALLY: But listen to me-ah,   
             I've got an idea,  
             Here's what we can do. 


        STU: I remember using this one song,
             Nine times, or maybe ten.  
      SALLY: Well, who says we have to, 
             Avoid repetition?  
        ALL: Let's use the same song again! 
             Let's use the same song again!

        ALL: But we'll write different words,   
      SALLY: For every new show,
        ALL: Or at least for two-thirds.
             And whenever we do it, 
             We know it gets more inane,

[M-3]  (Why  Can't  the  English Teach their Children How to M

   Why can't professors teach the Artsies how to speak? 
   The pure math kids know logic,   
   Applied Math ones know geek. 
   Chartered Accountants use COBOL, 
   While C.S. grads use 'C',
   But why can't the artsies talk to me?

111-PETER O.:  And then to  some  overworked  grad  student,
   struggling with an Artificial Intelligence program:

   I have often used this machine before,   
   But my programs always ran so nice and clean before, 
   Now each way I turn seems to crash and burn, 
   Is it me or this stupid machine? 


   So I hack all night with my belly tense, 
   Thinking that it's great to simulate intelligence.   
   Though I rant and rail, it's to no avail,
   Working here on this stupid machine! 


112-ELIJAH:  (READING FROM A PAPER AND GETTING MORE AND MORE
   FRANTIC) However, the sentient computer has evil  designs
   of  its  own. It enslaves the grad student and takes over
   the entire  campus  (except  optometry),  then  summoning
   dozens of killer robots tries to conquer the entire known
   universe...   (SHE  SEES  THE  CONFUSED  LOOKS   ON   HER

113-RICHIE:  Right. Instead the program now interfaces  with
   the grad student, modifying his moral code.  


114-AUDREY:   He  sees the Artsie; his heart goes flip-flop,
   his  output  on  life  changes,  and  everything  becomes
   peripheral to her.

   of, he chips away at her core, until the romance  is  in-

   time to "compile".

   ALL:  With a little bit  
         With a little bit  
         With a little bit of work we'll wreck your scene.  


   Our writing style requires the addition, 
   Of funny jokes, and tightly written prose.   
   Our own humour will not bear repetition, But 
   With a little bit of theft,  
   With a little bit of theft,  
   We can steal routines from other shows.  
   ALL:  With a little bit  
         With a little bit  
         With a little bit of theft we'll make 'em laugh.   


       It's wrong to steal the work of others.  
       But we're happy to declare,  
       That we don't care.  


   A tasteful show is sure to please the critics.   
   The censor board would greet it with delight.
   A tasteful show won't sell a single ticket, But  
   With a little bit of smut,   
   With a little bit of smut,   
   We can pack them in on every night.  
   ALL:  With a little bit, 
         With a little bit, 
         With a little bit of smut we'll pack them in.  
         With a little bit, 
         With a little bit, 
         With a little bit of steamy smut.

27-PETER R.:  Uh...  Hi.  For those of you  who  don't  know
   me,   I'm  Peter  Rabbitte, president of the FASS Theatre
   Company. I'd like to welcome you to the show and  to  the
   auditions.  To  make a long story  short,  we're  putting
   on  a  show  and...  these   are   the   auditions.   (IN
   DESPERATION) And now, I'd like to introduce...   


(JOHNNY RE-ENTERS AND THE PRESIDENT SNARES HIM) 


   ...someone  who  for the past twenty-five years has never
   let us down, Mr. John Fassaknowso--  


(HE STUMBLES OVER THE NAME, AND THEN SAYS THE  NAME  WE  ALL
KNOW JOHNNY BY) 


   Mr. Johnny Fass. 


(THERE IS SOME APPLAUSE)


28-JOHNNY FASS:   There's  not much I can tell  you  except,

   "have fun". Now, fun means parties,  and  the  person  in
   charge of parties is the Vice President, Pinhead Needles.


29-PETER R.:  (TO JOHNNY) Pinhead's not here yet.

   you when and where they are.  Mr. President?

   we  haven't  got much time, so I'm just going to lead you

63-SVEN:


   Finish our jobs. 
   Take off our disguises.  
   Here, take my Kleenex;   
   Wipe that lipstick away. 
   Show me your face,   
   Free of deception.   
   Plan for tomorrow;   
   Forget yesterday!


   Suddenly Ima,
   Is not undercover.   
   We don't need a story,   
   Don't have to be nice!   
   Suddenly Ima,
   We're free to discover,  
   As secret agents,
   (You) only live twice.   


64-IMA: 


   Nobody does it,  
   Better than you do.  
   Some move too quickly,   
   Others too slow. 
   I know affection,
   Still means something to you,
   Unlike Ernst Blofeld,
   And Doctor No!   


   Suddenly spying, 
   Does not seem like heaven.   
   We won't act like angels;
   We're free to raise hell.
   We can start playing,
   Like double oh seven,
   (Where) I'm Octopussy,   
   (And) you're Thunderball!


65-SVEN:



   Tell me tonight will,
   Be for your eyes only.   
   Tell me your secret, 
   I'll trade you one.

       I don't need a weapon,      (You don't need a weapon,)   
       To prove myself right!      (Yes, you're right!) 


   BOTH:
       Remember diamonds,   
       May be forever.

   found  a  way of putting an Olympic-size swimming pool on

10-TESS:  Damn!  It's not as if I've been pining for him all
   the way through the show.  It's not as if I  hung  around
   the wings between scenes just to see him.  It's not as if
   I dragged myself out of bed with a  hundred-degree  fever
   just to go to a rehearsal he might be at.


11-WANDA:  But you'll get over it ... won't you?


12-TESS:   I'll become a nun.  That's it!  I'll become a nun
   and I'll work my way up to mother superior and then arch-
   bishop and then cardinal and then pope, and then I'll ex-
   communicate the lousy son-of-a-bitch!


13-WANDA:  But  you're  not  Catholic  and  neither  is  he.
   Besides, a woman can't be pope.

14-TESS:  I can dream, can't I? 


15-WANDA:  Couldn't you two meet and talk this over?


16-TESS:  Yes!  I can see it now.  When we meet I'm the head
   of a large multinational conglomerate with an office  the

   size  of Waterloo Square and he's a lowly clerk.  I hitch
   a ride from behind my desk and I say, late for work again
   eh,  Robbie?   Why don't you just lick my bootlaces, Rob-
   bie? 


17-WANDA:  Well, I admit he behaved like a schmuck, but ... 


18-TESS:  That's it!  I've got  to  make  him  feel  guilty.
   I'll join the army and become a lesbian.  He'll feel real
   guilty when he's sitting on that park bench  with  Carrie
   and the sky suddenly darkens with roaring helicopters and
   the Ride of the Valkyries is booming out,  (SINGING)  da-
   dum-da-da-dum-dum   dum-da-da-dum-dum   dum-da-da-dum-dum
   dum-da-da-dum, and I'm up there with my lesbian army  and
   we've  got  napalm  and agent orange and I've got my M-16
   aimed right where it's gonna hurt him the most.  


19-WANDA:  Don't you think you're going a little too far?   


20-TESS:  Yeah, you're right.  He was a lousy lay anyway.

   We try, all our effort and more, 
   Do or die, just to open the door,
   And we cry, when we look at the score,   
   That's Warrior Football. 


   We guess our technique isn't sound,  
   We confess that our errors abound,   
   Nonetheless, we're the best game around, 
   That's Warrior Football. 


       Right up to the half,

         there's a victory near.
       We all have to laugh,
         we've got nothing to fear. 
       The crowd has reason to cheer.   
       With apologies extended, 
       There's no offense intended. 


   You smile, when you think how a play,
   Changed our style, so we know that one day,  
   In a while, we will beat Laurier!
       The Game is our Life,
       And Life is a Game of Warrior Football.

   The expressions are grim,
   On the faces of Argentine men as,
   The tides of war land,   
   Like a giant's great hand,   
   On the islands they call the Malvinas!   









   The British now fight,   
   With Imperial might,

   Which suggests that someone may be lying.
   And is his sly belle,

   Could it be that they both have been spying?

   (POINTS TO DICK AND JANE) You knew that old Mrs. Scraggly
   was changing her will in favour  of  Winston.  You  blud-
   geoned them both in order to protect your prospects for a
   higher education.  Right!?   


64-DICK:  Uh, wrong, actually.  We don't need any money.


65-JANE:  Yes, we get all the funding we  need  through  the
   Coffee Project.  








66-FRANK:  Coffee Project?  


67-JANE:   Yes,  for our master's degree we're searching for
   the perfect cup of coffee.  We came  down  here  to  grow
   freeze-dried coffee beans.   


68-DICK:  (PRODUCING COFFEE POT AND MUGS FROM SOMEWHERE) Try
   some.


69-JANE:  Good to the last...   


(OZZIE AND MARJ DRINK COFFEE, AND DROP, GOOD)   


   ...drop. 


70-DICK:  Damn! This'll delay our work on the perfect donut.


71-NARRATOR:  (TURNING TOWARD FRANK AND HARRIET)  And  where
   were  you  the night of September twenty-second, when the
   enigmatic actress Viola Flattery was shot?   


72-FRANK:  You can't pin that on us, gumshoe. That night  we
   was creaming the Cheese Gang.


73-HARRIET:   Yeah,  we're  really members of the Wine Gang.
   We're real dangerous. Fastest puns around.   


74-JANE:  Surely you mean guns. 


75-FRANK:  Nope, Puns!  Our  jokes  are  lethal.  Show  'em,
   Beaujolais!  


76-HARRIET:  Sure thing, Bordeaux. (TO DICK AND JANE) What's
   three feet tall and lives in a subway? A metrognome!

79-ALICE:  Who are you? 


80-BOND:  (LIGHTING CIGARETTE) The name is Bond.  Bond Fast-

81-NARRATOR:   Aha!  The same Glue who strangled Eustace En-
   derby when he and Sir Percy found out that you  were  em-
   bezzling  funds from the Scraggly estate to help  finance
   your alimony payments to Felicity while  trying  to  beat
   out Butterfield for Viola's hand?


82-BOND:   No.  You're  confusing  me  with  my crazy cousin
   Cyrano Acrylate. I'm a field agent  for  the  Fassablanca
   toy company.  We're play-testing a new war game. 


83-TED:  You mean you're responsible for all this?  


84-BOND:   Oh yes. No one can have a war without our permis-
   sion. We hold the copyright. 










85-NICK:  Do you also hold the copyright on murder? 


86-BOND:  No.   


(NICK PULLS A  GUN  AND  SHOOTS  BOND,  WHO  DIES  HORRIBLY.
NARRATOR SHOOTS NICK.  HE DIES HORRIBLY)


87-NARRATOR:   I'll do the shooting around here. (TO TED AND
   ALICE) That leaves you two.  


88-ALICE:  I've got an alibi. (POINTS TO  TED)  I  was  with
   him. 


89-TED:   I've  got  an  alibi. (POINTS TO ALICE) I was with
   her. 


90-NARRATOR:  Good enough. You two  are  innocent.   But  if
   it's not you then it must be--   


(HE SUDDENLY GRABS ANOTHER GUN WITH HIS LEFT HAND AND POINTS
IT AT HIS OWN HEAD) 


   (IN A DIFFERENT VOICE) So you  finally  figured  it  out,
   eh?   How  I  laughed  at you looking everywhere when the
   answer was staring  you  right  in  the  shaving  mirror.

LOSES.  HE DIES HORRIBLY)   


91-ALICE:   Well,  I  don't  have any great revelations. How
   about you? Are you really a powerful corporate executive,
   or  a brilliant university professor, or a suave debonair
   secret agent?


92-TED:  Nope. I'm exactly what I appear to be. 


(HE PULLS OFF HIS HAT, REVEALING A SET OF POINTED EARS.   HE
PULLS OUT A COMMUNICATOR AND FLIPS IT OPEN)
