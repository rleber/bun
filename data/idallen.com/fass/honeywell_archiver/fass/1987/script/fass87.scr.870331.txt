A renegade engineer, turned sheep rancher,

And the wacky chain of events as they are swept up  
in the Falklands war.   
.ch t1a 
Yes, folks, FASS meets Rogers and Hammerstein in the
musical melodrama "SOUTH ATLANTIC", 
.ch t1b 
A colourful yarn,   
.ch t1c 
with a tightly-knit plot,   
.ch t1d 
And BAAAAAd sheep jokes,

An ideal opportunity for songs like,
"We're gonna blow that ship right out of the sea."  
or  
"He loves ewes, baa, baa, baa." 
.ch t1b 
(WITH A WITHERING GLANCE) Or... 
.sb "The Sound of Gunfire" "Sound of Music" 
.ve 4   
The hills are alive, with the sound of gunfire. 
A sound they have heard, several times before.  
We're fighting it out, in the South Atlantic,   
For this tidbit of rocky and barren shore.  
.xx SAM~AND~JANET~EVENING

SAM: Some forgotten island  
 JANET: (ECHOING) Some forgotten island

 JANET: (ECHOING) In the South Atlantic 
SAM: Where the pace is frantic  
 JANET: And there's no time for love.

.ch t2a 
Hi. 
Since this is going to be FASS's
twenty-fifth show, we thought it would  
be fun to do a retrospective, called
"FASS Backwards".   
.ch t2b 
FASS has a long and glorious past-- 
.ch t2c 
Made up of long and glorious shows--
.ch t2d 
With an emphasis on the "long". 
.ad 
(AL HITS STU)

And these shows featured some songs that
were incredible--   
.ch t2d 
And inaudible.

So we'd like to bring back some of the  
tried and true songs of FASS.   
.sb "Same Song" "Time Warp"

     STU: It's distressing, 
          And somewhat depressing,  
          That we can't write anything new. 
   SALLY: But listen to me-ah,  
          I've got an idea, 
          Here's what we can do.
.ve 6

          Nine times, or maybe ten. 
   SALLY: Well, who says we have to,
          Avoid repetition? 
     ALL: Let's use the same song again!

     STU: We can use the same tune,

     ALL: Or at least for two-thirds.   
          And whenever we do it,
          We know it gets more inane,   
          Let's use the same song again!

(THE LAST FOUR THEME-PEOPLE RISE UP)
.ch t3a 
We would also like to propose a musical-based theme.
.ch t3b 
Set right here in the University,   
.ch t3c 

Based on the inherent troubles in teaching  
computer science to Artsies.
.ch t3d 
We'd call it "My Fair Mathie"   
.ch t3a 
We open with a sentient computer
complaining about being unable to talk  
with Artsies.   
.sb "Medley" "Songs from My Fair Lady"  
.md 
(Why Can't the English Teach their Children How to Speak)   
.ve 6   
Why can't professors teach the Artsies how to speak?
The pure math kids know logic,  
Applied Math ones know geek.
Chartered Accountants use COBOL,
While C.S. grads use 'C',   
But why can't the artsies talk to me?   
.ch t3b 
Cut to an unassuming Artsie:
.md 
(Oh, Wouldn't It Be Loverly)
.ve 4   
Here I stand in the lecture hall,   
One of thousands, against the wall, 
Oh Gosh, I feel so small,   
So this is university.  
.ch t3c 
And then to some overworked grad student,   
struggling with an Artificial   
Intelligence program:   
.md 
(On the Street Where You Live)  
.ve 4   
I have often used this machine before,  
But my programs always ran so nice and clean before,
Now each way I turn seems to crash and burn,
Is it me or this stupid machine?
.ve 4   
So I hack all night with my belly tense,




Thinking that it's great to simulate intelligence.  
Though I rant and rail, it's to no avail,   
Working here on this stupid machine!
.ch t3d 
(READING FROM A 
.prop "PAPER"   
AND GETTING MORE AND MORE FRANTIC)  
However, the sentient computer has evil designs 
of its own. It enslaves the grad student and
takes over the entire campus (except optometry),
then summoning dozens of killer robots  
tries to conquer the entire known universe...   
(SHE SEES THE CONFUSED LOOKS ON HER COMPANIONS' FACES,  
AND STOPS, CHECKING THE PIECE OF PAPER) 
Sorry, that was 
.ul 
last
year's theme proposal.  
.ch t3a 
Right. Instead the program now interfaces with the  
grad student, modifying his moral code. 
.ch t3b 
He sees the Artsie; his heart goes flip-flop,   
his output on life changes, 
and everything becomes peripheral to her.   
.ch t3c 
Bit by bit, using every device he can think of, he chips
away at her core, until the romance is interrupted, 
and he is dumped.   
.ch c2  
I bet a story like that would take a long time to "compile".
.ch c1  
Really? The whole idea "bugs" me.   
.ch jf  
If you two "cards" don't "pipe" down, I'll "deck"
