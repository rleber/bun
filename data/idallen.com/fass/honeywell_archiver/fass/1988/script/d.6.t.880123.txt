(LIGHTS UP ON GEORGE AND JESSICA)   
.ch him 
Now 
.ul 
that
was a classic film! 
.ch her 
Unforgettable.  
.ch him 
I mean, when the slasher drives 
.ul 
through 
the window to get the last cheerleader...   
and I thought they'd done all they could with Halloween XIII... 
.ch her 
I could see how you could think that.   
.ch him 
I mean, that's cinema art!  
It had the political undertones of Wertmuller's 
.ul 
Swept Away, 
but with the narrative sweep characteristic of Griffith's great work,   
.ul 
Birth of a Nation.  
.ch her 
Would you   
.ul 
look
at the time!
Gotta run, George.  
It's been...
well, words fail me.
.ch him 
So, Jessica, do you want to come over to my place to -- 
.ch her 
No. 
.ch him 
Or maybe we could --
.ch her 
I'm sure we couldn't.   
.ch him 
I have this new --  
.ch her 
I don't think so.   
.ch him 
Does this mean we're through?   
.ch her 
"We're through"?
What do you mean, "Does this mean we're through?"   
What "we"?  
.ch him 
Our relationship, Jessica.  
Are you saying that our relationship is over?   
.ch her 
What we share is not a relationship, George.
A relationship is a mutually-rewarding meeting of two compatible souls. 
We  
.ul 
can't   
be having a relationship because
.ul 
I   
am not rewarded,
.ul 
we  
are not compatible, 
and 
.ul 
you 
have no soul.   
.ch him 
Wait, are you telling me we aren't compatible?  
.ch her 
Compatible? 
We have 
.ul 
nothing 
in common.  
.ch him 
Sure we do. 
Look, bilateral symmetry.   
.ch her 
Be serious. 
.ch him 
You're telling me that after I shelled out six-fifty each for three movies  
.ul 
and 
parking, you're just dumping me?
.ch her 
What does the price of a movie have to do with this?
.ch him 
I've dropped 45 bucks on this relationship, Jessica, and I don't think I'm  
getting my money's worth.   
.ch her 
Oh, did you expect me to
.ul 
sleep   
with you for three flicks and some oversalted popcorn?  
.ch him 
No -- the popcorn was a gift from me to you.
.ch her 
Well,   
.ul 
that
makes the difference.   
Let's fuck. 
.ch him 
What?   
Here?   
.ch her 
George, you've opened my eyes.  
I have been a selfish little tease, ruthlessly manipulating you for the 
opportunity to see such landmark cinematic entertainments as
"Scythe of the Reaper" and "Reaper's Revenge".  
I owe you sex.  
.ch him 
You do? 
That's right, you do.   
That's great, it's really great, and you like me and everything, so it's
okay, right?
.ch her 
I beg your pardon?  
.ch him 
A guy's first time, it oughta mean something.   
.ch her 
Oh, wait a minute.  
You're a virgin?
--What am I saying, of course you're a virgin.  
.ch him 
Not so loud!
.ch her 
George, let's be serious.   
You don't want to have your first sexual experience with some stranger you've   
taken to a few slasher movies.  
.ch him 
Yes I do.   
.ch her 
Your first time should be with a nice girl who's crazy about you.   
You deserve something...
special.
.ch him 
I do?   
.ch her 
Yes, of course you do.  
.ch him 
You mean, like leather or something?
.ch her 
.ul 
No! 
You're a very special guy and you deserve the best. 
I mean, you're smart.   

I don't know anyone who knows as much about horror flicks as you.   
You're bright.  
Look at the way you added up the movie prices so fast.  
.ch him 
I've always been good with figures. 
.ch her 
You see?
A guy with your brains and talents deserves --  
.ch him 
You think I'm smart?
.ch her 
Sure I do.  
So why don't you -- 
.ch him 
You think I'm talented! 
.ch her 
Well, yes, but --   
.ch him 
Face it, Jessica, you're crazy about me!
.ch her 
.ul 
No! 
.ch him 
.ul 
Yes!
.ch her 
No! 
.ch him 
No? 
.ch her 
No. 
.ch him 
Why?
.ch her 
Because.
.ch him 
Because?
.ch her 
Because!
.ch him 
Because why?
.ch her 
Because you're... too short!
.ch him 
I can be taller.
.ch her 
I hate glasses. 
.ch him 
My contacts arrive tomorrow.
.ch her 
Your hair --
.ch him 
Can be cut, coloured or styled. 
You're making excuses, Jessica. 
What's really wrong with me?
.ch her 
George, you're a cultureless techno-geek without a romantic bone in your
tastelessly-clad body.  
.ch him 
(DROPPING TO ONE KNEE)  
What light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east and Jessica is the sun.  

Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon. 
(STANDS)
Did I ever tell you that you hang upon the cheek of night like a rich jewel 
in an Ethiope's ear?
.ch her 
George, here.   
(GIVES GEORGE A TWENTY DOLLAR BILL) 
.prip "TWENTY DOLLAR BILL"  
It was nineteen-fifty for the movies, here's a twenty, keep the change. 
I'm going to walk away, now, George.
Have a good life, lose my phone number. 
.ch him 
What about parking? 
.ch her 
(REMOVES EARRINGS)  
Just pawn these.
(PAUSE.  SHE HANDS HIM HER RING)
The ring, it's worth two hundred bucks. 
(HANDS HIM A SET OF KEYS)   
Take my car.
Do you need a condo apartment?  
I was leaving the city anyway.  
.prip "EARRINGS"
.prip "RING"
.prip "SET OF KEYS"

(SHE LEAVES)
.ch him 
(CALLS AFTER HER)   
I guess Friday night's off, then.
