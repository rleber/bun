IS THE SYSTEM UNIT WITH A CLEAR PLASTIC BUBBLE ON TOP.  
IN FRONT OF THIS IS A CONSOLE WITH KEYBOARD (POSSIBLY WITH SCREEN),

SIDE IS A DESK WITH DRAWERS, WITH A TERMINAL ON IT. 
THERE ARE ALSO TWO CHAIRS:  ONE WITH THE CONSOLE AND ONE WITH THE DESK. 
ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE IS A LARGE DOORFRAME WITH A CLOSED DOOR
EQUIPPED WITH A BEEPING DIGIT-ENTRY COMBINATION LOCK.

With all due respect, the operational parameters of the 
CUPID project are far beyond the limits of my department.  This becomes 
clear if we picture the university as a big friendly St. Bernard, the   
CUPID project as a ravenous wood tick, and you as a Hartz   
2-in-1 flea collar --   
.ch gn  
Let 
me  
explain it to you, Goldstein!  (PATRONIZINGLY)  The university  
needs money.  The university charges a fee to get money.  The   
university needs a reason to charge the fee, otherwise the nasty
provincial politicians will say the fee is illegal.  So the 
university charges for computer 
dating and calls it a "social service fee".  (THREATENINGLY)  Got it?   
.ch cw  
But we told you your deadline is impossible to meet!
