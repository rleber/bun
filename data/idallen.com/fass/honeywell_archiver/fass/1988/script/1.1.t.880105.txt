You see, boys and girls, the university is like a great big anthill.
In the center of every anthill is the queen ant, the most important ant 
of all. 

.....b..
fass



The administration is the queen ant's head, the faculty is her thorax,  
the staff is her legs, and the budget is her small intestine.   
Like a queen ant, the university administration lays eggs, sometimes
hundreds of them a day. 
.ad 
(BELLA'S NEXT LINE ACTUALLY STARTS HERE.
THE REST OF THIS SPEECH IS BACKGROUND FOR BELLA AND ED'S LINES, 
AND SHOULD CONTINUE UNTIL MACK NEXT SPEAKS) 
.ex 
The students, yourselves, are the worker ants, who must work all day in 
order to feed the queen so that she may produce more workers so that
she may produce more workers to run the hill.   
These workers then help to produce more eggs, which become workers, 
and so on.  
As you can see, the system is self-referential, recursive, and redundant.   
But if too many of the ants of today decide to say "I don't feel like   
hauling around those pupae anymore, I mean, what good does it do me?",  
the whole system falls apart.   
This becomes clear if we imagine the student body as an immense crowd   
of chimpanzees forming a pyramid and the CUPID matches as a bunch of
bananas stuck to the top floor of the Arts Library. 
The chimpanzees nearer to the apex of the pyramid have a much better
chance of getting a 

chance of getting a banana than the ones nearer to the bottom.  
But without those lower ranks in the ape pyramid, nobody gets any   
bananas at all! 
It's as simple as that.
