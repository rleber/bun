(LIGHTS UP ON MIKE AND GOLDIE CENTRE STAGE ON TWO STOOLS, WITH A BANK OF
PEOPLE MANNING PHONES ON A LONG TABLE BEHIND.  PEOPLE ARE   
STRATEGICALLY PLACED IN THE AUDIENCE AISLES IN ORDER TO ACCEPT  
PLEDGES FROM AUDIENCE MEMBERS, AND HAND OUT THE 'FREE GIFTS'.   
THERE ARE ALSO PEOPLE NEAR THE EDGE OF THE  
STAGE, READY TO TAKE TOTALS AND PASS THEM TO ONE PERSON, WHO IS KEEPING 
TRACK OF THE PLEDGE TOTAL ON SOME BIG SCORE BOARD, WHICH SAYS   
"TOTAL PLEDGES")

TO WHICH THE PHONE PEOPLE RESPOND)

(NOTE:  MIKE AND GOLDIE WILL OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO ADJUST THEIR LINES TO
ACCOMODATE THE ACTUAL PLEDGES THAT ARE COMING IN, COMMENTING ON THE 
RATE, AND PRESSING MORE URGENTLY WHEN THE TOTAL GETS CLOSE TO THE   
SUPPOSED GOAL.  THEREFORE IT WOULD BE WISEST TO CAST EXPERIENCED
IMPROVISERS IN THIS SCENE)

(LAUGHING IN RESPONSE TO THE END OF THE LAST SCENE)  Well,  
have you ever seen anything so funny!?  These FASS shows are just great!
We're now going to take this brief membership opportunity to try and reach  
our goal of 47 new laughing audience members.  All you have to do   
is catch the eye of one of our enthusiastic volunteers standing 
in the aisles, and give your pledge of mirth.  They've  
been nice enough to give up their time - won't you please keep them busy?   
.ch mi  
That's right, Goldie.  We're not asking a lot; we're
just asking you to consider how much this kind of comedy means to   
you.  Take an honest look at yourself:  Have you been laughing at   
the jokes in the show as much as you should?  Maybe you're thinking,
if I'm the only one laughing, I'll look silly.  Well, what if   
everyone felt that way?  Then no one would make a sound.  But if every  
one of you out there were to pledge just the occasional titter, 
it would really add up. 
.ch go  
That's so true, Mike.  Now, other shows on this campus may  
fill the audience with friends of the cast, to supply peals of laughter and 
applause, but FASS can't do that.  All of OUR friends are up here   
with us.  That's why we need your support now.  
Without that support, FASS next year may actually have to be cut
down to less than three hours.  Or if the show doesn't meet with the
approval of the administration, who knows, it may go the way of 
other campus entertainment, and disappear altogether.  We know you  
don't want that to happen.  
.ch mi  
Remember, when you deliver the laughs you've pledged, you have  
the opportunity to direct   
your giggles toward the kind of humour you enjoy.  Maybe you've always  
been fond of the silly character names, or perhaps your 
favourites have been the engineer jokes.  Maybe your taste runs 
to the obscure, and you really hoot at the Gazette references.  
Whatever your choice, you now have the chance to make your voice
heard.  
.ch go  
Of course, with your pledge, you can take advantage of one of the   
many membership premiums we're offering.  With a membership pledge of   
10 grins, you can receive your very own set of beautifully-designed FASS
coasters.  For 25 chuckles, we're offering your choice of FASS programs 
and tickets from our archives,  
and for a pledge of 50 guffaws or more, you may have your very own FASS 
poster, while quantities last.  Finally, if you promise to  
respond to every joke with roars of delight, you will receive a free
gift of 2 tickets to next year's show, as our special thank-you.  You   
don't even have to understand   
the jokes, and I'm sure that will comfort the Artsies in the crowd. 
As always, you don't have to pay these amounts all at once. 
You can split them up into amounts of 5 chortles per scene, or  
you might save them all up and give us a standing ovation after 
the closing song.  It's up to you.  
Remember, your pledge is tax-deductible, and may be charged 
to your VISA, MasterCard or American Express.

REACH THAT FINAL GOAL)  
.ch go  
Before we wrap up our pledge break, we want to make sure we've  
squeezed everything possible from our viewing audience.  Are there  
any last pledges?   
.ch mi  
(HESITANT)  Well, as a matter of fact, Goldie, I've got a pledge to make.   
.ch go  
(STAGE WHISPER)  Mike, what are you talking about?! 
.ch mi  
(THROWING HIMSELF AT HER FEET)  Damn it all, Goldie!
I want to pledge my love!   
.ch go  
Mike!!! 
.ch mi  
All these years, spent grovelling for peanuts from our ungrateful   

audience, all the while sitting just inches away from you, craving  
the touch of your hand!!  I can't live this lie any longer! 
.ch go  
(GENUINELY MOVED)  Oh, Mike.  I never knew.     
.ch mi  
I promise you, Goldie, that with your continuing support,   
I can guarantee the kind of quality programming you've come to enjoy!   
.ch go  
(EMBRACING HIM)  Mike, darling!  (TURNING TO AUDIENCE)  Since any   
further pledges would seem inconsequential, we will now return to   
"An Old-FASSioned Love Song" with no further interruptions.
