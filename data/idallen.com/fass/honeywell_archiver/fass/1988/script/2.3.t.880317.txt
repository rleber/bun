Greetings, honoured ones.   
We are the Guy Ding Society of Waterloo.

The Guy Ding Society?

Yes.
We are followers of the Guy Ding Light. 
.ch m2  
3:00 weekdays on CBS.

Allow me to explain.
.sb "Meditate" "Shall We Dance?"
.ve 4   
If this is what you seek, a life of inner calm  
You might be wise to turn your eyes to things Confucius said
But if someone intrudes and disturbs your peace of mind 
I would suggest - it might be best - to give a boot to the head.
.ve 9   
Meditate!  You know I'd never harm a tiny fly   
Meditate!  But it's not in my karma to deny 
That it's great to attack and disarm a passerby 
As you contemplate your navel   
Just be damn sure that you save a   
Little thought for the folks you hate,  
While you're yinning and you're yanging 
Keep account of heads you're banging
Meditate, meditate, meditate!   
.ve 10  
.ss ALL~MARTIAL~ARTISTS 
Meditate!  Keep those thoughts transcendental in your mind  
Meditate!  If your soul's orientally inclined   
Mutilate!  Never acting too gentle or too kind  
Pay attention to the master 
Or he'll use your guts for plaster  
You can put it down to fate,
He'll consult the book of changes   
As your face he rearranges, 
Meditate, meditate, meditate!

Now please leave this room, so that we may leap about and shout in private.

(TO BENTON) No way! 
We were here first, and our meeting is more 
important than yours, so if I hear one word from you oversized

Only twice before have I journeyed down from my mountain top.

Okay -- let us begin.   
The project to effect the sabotage of the main CUPID installation   
must be considered a complete success.

Or the fee.

What else can we do?

May a great Tibetan guru make a suggestion? 
.ch ha  
Sure, go ahead. 
.ch rama
The administration will not admit the CUPID prog

The administration will not admit the CUPID program is a failure unless 
we rub their noses in it.   
I could contact an omnipresent, omniscient entity who could guide us
in this venture.
.ch muf 
Sounds good to me.  
Spiritual encounters were number 3 on   
David Letterman's Top Ten list of meaningless endeavours.   
.ch ir  
And number one was trying to get you to say something intelligent.  
.ch tyr 
Do you really think some primitive ritualistic exercise will
help us?
.ch muf 
No, but I read in the Enquirer that dabbling in mysticism improves  
your sex life.  
.ch rama
Not when you're in Tibet, surrounded only by mountain goats.
.ch muf 
Oh. 
.ch rama
First of all, it shall be necessary for us to get in touch with our 
inner selves, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly 
go where no one has gone before...

When you live your whole life on a Tibetan mountaintop, you do not hear 
many good jokes.
Except, of course, the one about the travelling salesman and the
farmer's daughter --
