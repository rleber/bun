TRAP ON STAGE.  THIS SHOULD BE A REAL RUBE GOLDBERG DEVICE. PICTURE 
A LARGE SCALE MODEL OF THE MOUSETRAP GAME AND YOU'VE GOT THE IDEA.  
THE TRAP SHOULD HAVE SOME VERY OBVIOUS FINAL ACTION, I.E. A NET OR  
CAGE SUSPENDED ABOVE THE STAGE, OR PERHAPS LARGE STEEL JAWS.
BELLA AND ED ARE WORKING QUICKLY AND COMPETENTLY.  TOM IS QUITE 
HOPELESS.  TOM SHOULD ACT LIKE BELLA'S PUPPYDOG.  BELLA SHOULD  
TAKE NO SPECIAL NOTICE OF THIS.  ED SHOULD BE HUMMING TO HIMSELF
AND LOOKING IDIOTICALLY SELF-SATISFIED.  SUDDENLY, HIS MOOD CHANGES 
AND HE LOOKS UPSET.  HE BEGINS TO SING)

.ve 2   

CHORUS:  Magical, wonderful, terrible obsession 
 	 Marvelous, hopeless, bittersweet love.   
.ve 5   
When I saw her face                 
 my world became enchanted  
My soul's deepest wish              
 would finally be granted   
If she were mi-ine  
.ve 1   
(CHORUS)
.ve 6   
But ere it began
 our love it was blighted   
Fate has intervened 
 we cannot be united
My heart is filled with pain
 for I love in vain.
.ve 1   
(CHORUS)
.ch er  
CUPID, bah! 
Love shouldn't be dictated by a computer.   
People should be free to choose their heart's desire.   
.ch tm  
Darn right! 
(OVEREMPHASIZED)
It must be hard on anyone who is in love with one of the CUPID volunteers.

.ch ep  
Good evening, class.
The preceding speech was an example of dramatic irony.  Dramatic
irony occurs when a character's speech sounds ironic to the audience
because of something they know but the character doesn't.   
.ad 
(EXIT HOWARD.  ACTION RESUMES)  
.ch sa  
(DERISIVELY) Love, who needs it?  I don't have time 
for that sort of nonsense.  
I do, however, object to paying 
for a service we never wanted, don't need and can't use.
.ch tm  
Darn right! 
.ch sa  
So, Ed, who have you fallen in love with?   
.ch er  
(UNCONVINCINGLY) No one.
.ad 
(BELLA GIVES ED A "TELL ME ANOTHER ONE" LOOK)   
.ch sa  
Right.  
.ch er  
Don't you believe in love, Bella?   
.ch sa  
Yeah, I suppose so.  I just have more important things on my
mind at the moment. (STRIKES POSE)  
But if I ever do decide to fall 
in love the decision will be mine and mine alone!   
.ad 
(ALL FREEZE.  ENTER HOWARD) 
.ch ep  
The preceding speech was an example of foreshadowing, a reference within
a story to events that will happen later.  In this case, Bella says she 
will make her own decisions about love, whereas later on in the play
decisions are imposed upon her by an outside force.  Oh dear, I just gave   
it away, didn't I?  The preceding speech is no longer an example of 
foreshadowing; it is now an example of dramatic irony.  
.ad 
(HOWARD EXITS, ACTION RESUMES)  
.ch tm  
Why do they call it falling in love anyway? 
.ch sa  
Because "falling in like" sounds silly, and "falling in lust" is
illegal in Ontario. 
.ad 
(BELLA, ED AND TOM FINISH INSTALLING THE TRAP BY THIS POINT)

This present speech is an example of self reference.
Self reference occurs when  
a character within a play makes reference to the play itself.   
Self reference can be clever and subtle but at other times it can be
nothing more than a cheap device to cover an awkward transition.
When indulging in self reference be sure never to mention 16 ton
weights falling out of nowhere...
