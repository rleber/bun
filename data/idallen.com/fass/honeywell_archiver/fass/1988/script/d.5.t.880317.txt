(LIGHTS UP ON A SPLIT STAGE.  THERE ARE TWO GROUPS MAKING LAST MINUTE   
PREPARATIONS FOR A WEDDING. 
RUDY AND CLEM ARE ON ONE SIDE OF THE STAGE. 
SARAH AND OPHELIA ARE ON THE OTHER) 
.ch bm  
You must be the happiest man alive -- marrying the girl of your dreams. 
.ch gr  
Yes -- I knew that she was the girl for me from the moment we   
first met.  
.ld 
(LIGHTS DOWN ON THIS SIDE, UP ON THE OTHER) 
.ch br  
I can remember first seeing him at the Watpub in Deep River.
He was the best looking guy in the place.   
.ch mh  
There were only three guys there.   
But I know what you mean.   
.ch br  
It was fate -- we're so much alike. 
We both like Chinese food, horror movies, Glenn Miller...   
.ch mh  
You do dance well together. 
.ch br  
...and we both squeeze the toothpaste from the same end.
.ch mh  
That's important, you know. 
Little things like that can cause so much   
grief later.
.ld 
(LIGHTS DOWN ON THIS SIDE, UP ON THE OTHER) 
.ch gr  
I can picture the reception:
the two of us dancing the whole evening 
together, looking deep into each other's eyes, and then sneaking off
early.  
.ch bm  
I hope you don't leave too early.   
.ch gr  
Why do you say that?
.ch bm  
I'd like to dance with her too. 
.ch gr  
(MAGNANIMOUSLY) 
Oh, all right.  
But just once.  
.ld 
(LIGHTS DOWN ON THIS SIDE, UP ON THE OTHER) 
.ch br  
What a fantastic time we're going to have tonight!  
I'll dance with 
every guy in the room, we'll party with all our friends, and we won't   
stop until we see the sun rise. 
.ch mh  
What about the groom?   
.ch br  
(LIGHTLY)   
Oh, I'll dance with him too.
But just once.

(A SLIGHT PAUSE)
.ch mh  
So what did you decide for the honeymoon?   
Are you going hiking in the Rockies?
.ch br  
No, we're going to Niagara Falls.   
Personally I think it's too touristy,   
but he thought it would be romantic.
.ld 
(LIGHTS DOWN ON THIS SIDE, UP ON THE OTHER) 
.ch bm  
Niagara Falls?  
No one goes to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon
anymore!
Why not some exotic Caribbean island with white,
sandy beaches, beautiful, tanned women and all the cheap rum you
can drink?  
.ch gr  
I was thinking about something like that, but she was really
keen on Niagara Falls.  
She thought it would be romantic.   
.ch bm  
(CONSPIRATORIALLY)  
You probably won't leave your hotel room anyway.
.ld 
(LIGHTS DOWN ON THIS SIDE, UP ON THE OTHER) 
.ch mh  
So what are your long term plans?   
Are you going to have kids? 
.ch br  
No. 
I can picture it -- just
the two of us, in a waterfront condo, with my three cats.   
.ld 
(LIGHTS DOWN ON THIS SIDE, UP ON THE OTHER) 
.ch bm  
Are you sure she'll want seven kids?
.ch gr  
Of course she will. 
She's from a big family herself.
I picture us gathered around
the barbecue, in a quiet little suburb, growing old together gracefully.
.ch bm  
All you need is a dog to make the picture complete. 
.ch gr  
Sorry, no pets. 
I'm allergic to animal hair, remember?  
.ch bm  
Right.  
.ad 
(PAUSE) 
.ex 
I guess with seven kids one of you will have to stay home.  
.ch gr  
She will.   

She's not interested in a career.   
.ld 
(LIGHTS DOWN ON THIS SIDE, UP ON THE OTHER) 
.ch mh  
Are you going to tell him about your promotion? 
.ch br  
No. 
(APOLOGETICALLY)
I know I should, but I want to keep it a surprise.  
I'm sure he'll be thrilled.

BOTH GROUPS FINISH LAST MINUTE  
PREPARATIONS)

(THE NEXT TWO LINES ARE ALMOST SIMULTANEOUS)
.ch br  
Oh, I'm so nervous. 
.ch gr  
Wish me luck.   
.xx OPHELIA~AND~CLEM
Don't worry, you two were meant for each other.
