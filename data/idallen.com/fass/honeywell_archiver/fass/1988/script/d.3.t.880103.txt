(LIGHTS UP. 
THIS VIGNETTE MAKES USE OF THE SPACE IN FRONT OF THE CURTAIN, WHERE IT IS   
TWILIGHT OF A NOVEMBER EVENING. 
A LARGE (PERSON-SIZED) WICKER BASKET IS SITTING AT CENTER STAGE, WITH   
A BLANKET INSIDE WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY COVERING SOMETHING. 
SUDDENLY, CAT AND JAMMER (A DOG) ENTER, THE LATTER IN FURIOUS PURSUIT OF
THE FORMER. 
BOTH SHOULD APPEAR TO BE STRAYS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE SPECIES, YET NOT BE TOO 
SCRUFFY.
AS THEY PASS THE BASKET, CAT DUCKS BEHIND IT AND TRIPS JAMMER;  
AS THE DOG PICKS HIMSELF UP FROM HIS DRAMATIC PRATFALL, CAT BLINDLY LEAPS   
INTO THE BASKET AND VANISHES.   
AND THERE WE START THE SCENE)   
.ch ca  
Mrreoww!
What's this?
.ch ja  
(RISING)
Hey, Cat... 
.ad 
(PAUSE) 
.ex 
(LOOKING AROUND)
Cat...? 
.ad 
(ANOTHER PAUSE) 
.ex 
You're not supposed to disappear, Cat.  
You're supposed to run down to the corner and climb up on Mr. Wilson's  
roof.   
And then he'll come out and --  
.ch ca  
(HUSHED)
Quiet, Jammer.  
You'll wake it! 
.ch ja  
(IDLING OVER)   
Wake what?  
What's in the basket?   
.ch ca  
Take a look.
.ad 
(CAT FOLDS BACK THE BLANKET)
.ch ja  
Hey!
It's a human pup!   
.ch ca  
Boy, are you ignorant, Jammer.  
It's a human kitten.
.ch ja  
Pup.
.ch ca  
Kitten. 
.ch ja  
No, I --
Wait, I remember now.   
It's a human
.ul 
baby.   
.ch ca  
Baby, hmmm? 
Well, it looks cute enough --   
Hey!
There's a bottle of milk in here!   
.ad 
(CAT DOES APPROPRIATE THINGS WITH THE BABY'S BOTTLE.
CAT IS NOT STUPID, BUT  
.ul 
IS  
HUNGRY) 
.ch ja  
Uh, Cat...  
.ad 
(CAT IGNORES JAMMER, INTENT ON THE MILK)
.ex 
Cat, I don't think this is right.   
I've been on the street six years, and I've never seen a baby alone before. 
Not 
.ul 
ever.   
And it's gonna get dark and cold soon.  
.ch ca  
Oh, all right.  
I'm finished with the milk anyway.  
.ad 
(CAT RECOILS, AS IF POKED BY THE BABY)  
.ex 
Ow! 
Take it easy!   
Jammer, how do you tame one of these things?
I don't think cuffing it will work. 
.ch ja  
Uh...   
well, I know you don't growl at a baby, 'cause Rex did that once and
the big humans took him away.   
I think you're supposed to act nice to it.  
Maybe.  
.ch ca  
Nice, huh?  
Okay, I'll try butting it a little. 
.ad 
(CAT STICKS UPPER BODY FURTHER INTO BASKET, AS IF BUTTING)  
.ch ja  
Well?   
.ch ca  
I'm not sure... 
it looks a bit confused.
(LAUGHTER)  
Wait a minute -- I think it's going to butt me baaack!  
.ad 
(CAT FLIES OUT OF THE BASKET AND LANDS WITH A DISTINCT LACK OF CATLIKE  
GRACE)  
.ch ja  
Strong little baby, isn't it?   
.ch ca  
(DAZED) 
Ooooh -- my head.   
(RECOVERING)
That didn't work too well, did it?  
.ch ja  
Uh-uh.  
Hey, why don't I go down to the corner and bark until Mr. Wilson
comes out?  
Then I'll --
.ch ca  
Catch a shoe in the face, and you know it.  
You're an okay animal for a dog, Jammer, but -- 
.ad 
(CAT IS INTERRUPTED BY THE BABY CRYING) 
.ex 
You know, I'm starting to like this little human.   
It could teach me some new yowling tricks.  
.ch ja  
Well, at least it can't get any worse.  
.ad 
(IT BEGINS TO SNOW, AND THE BABY IS DISTRACTED ENOUGH TO STOP CRYING.   
ALL LOOK UP, AND THE NEXT THREE LINES ARE SAID FROM THIS POSTURE)   
.ch ca  
Jammer? 
.ch ja  
Yeah?   
.ch ca  
Shut up.
.ch ja  
We gotta do something soon, Cat.
It hasn't got any fur, and it'll freeze out here.   
.ch ca  
Hmmm.   
Heck, Jammer,   
.ul 
we've   
been through winters before.
How did we keep warm when our fur wasn't good enough?   
.ch ja  
Um...   
we found nice humans.   
.ch ca  
It's getting dark.  
No humans around.   
.ch ja  
We slept over sewer vents or in doorways.   
.ch ca  
The basket's too big for us to move.
.ch ja  
We cuddled up together. 
.ad 
(JAMMER PAUSES AS CAT GETS INTO BASKET) 
.ex 
Oh, hey, think that would work? 
.ch ca  
Jammer, get in here.
.ad 
(JAMMER JOINS CAT AND THE BABY IN THE BASKET.   
AS THE SNOW CONTINUES TO FALL AND DARKNESS SETTLES, THE TWO ANIMALS 
SNUGGLE FIRMLY BESIDE THE BABY) 
.ch ja  
It's still pretty open here, Cat.   
We might freeze too.
.ch ca  
Shut up, Jammer.
.ad 
(PAUSE) 
.ch ja  
I have a question.  
.ch ca  
What?   
.ch ja  
Well, I'm here because I'm a dog, and dogs like humans. 
But I know that you don't care much for humans yourself.
.ch ca  
So? 
.ch ja  
So why are you here?
.ad 
(PAUSE) 
.ch ca  
Because maybe I like some dogs.
