(LIGHTS UP ON TWO PROFESSORS SITTING IN CHAIRS ANGLED TO FACE EACH  
OTHER SOMEWHAT. 
THEY ARE IN THE MIDST OF AN ARGUMENT)   
.ch p1  
Do you honestly expect me to believe
.ul 
that?   
.ch p2  
I certainly do. 
Love is independent of conscious thought or any other rational process. 
You can no more choose to love someone than you can choose to spontaneously 
become a walnut.
.ch p1  
So...?  
.ch p2  
So just sit back and appreciate love wherever you find it.  
.ch p1  
Hah!
You determinists are all alike. 
Lazy.   
.ch p2  
Lazy!   
Why --  
.ch p1  
I repeat, lazy. 
Instead of holding to the sensible belief that only the exercise of man's   
free will produces anything of real consequence, including the thing we 
call "love",
.ul 
you 
claim that love is simply "meant to happen" between certain people. 
Lazy.   
.ch p2  
Elegant.
It conserves effort.
.ch p1  
You're saying, then, that I have no control over the chain of events
that lead up to a romantic relationship.
.ch p2  
Correct.
.ch p1  
For example,
one day, instead of greeting you with the usual "Good morning, Professor
Dwyer", I would spontaneously and uncontrollably greet you with a   
statement like "Good morning, Professor Dwyer -- has anyone told you
what sparkling blue eyes you have?" 
.ch p2  
Precisely.  
.ad 
(PAUSE) 
.ex 
Do I?   
.ch p1  
Hmmm?   
.ch p2  
Do you really think I have sparkling blue eyes... or was it just an 
example you chose?  
.ch p1  
Oh! 
Uh... I suppose I just chose it at random.  
.ch p2  
You mean, in a spontaneous and uncontrolled manner? 
.ch p1  
Well, random choice...  
.ad 
(THE PREVIOUS STATEMENT SINKS IN)   
.ex 
Now 
.ul 
wait
a minute!   
.ch p2  
(SMILING)   
It's all right -- really.   
.ad 
(PAUSE) 
.ch p1  
It is?  
.ch p2  
Of course.  
One doesn't argue with the will of fate.
.ch p1  
Now there you go, bringing fate into it again.  
If we --
.ch p2  
All right, all right.   
I'll concede for the moment that fate doesn't control all aspects of
interpersonal relationships.
There are some elements which remain firmly within human control.   
.ch p1  
Such as?
.ch p2  
Well, some of the finer philosophical points should be worked out in
private...  
but a statement such as "Your place or mine?" certainly requires
conscious thought.  
.ad 
(PAUSE) 
.ex 
I mean, if I explained to you that I have a large stack of term papers  
currently spread out over my bedroom floor --   
.ch p1  
Do you? 
.ch p2  
Hmmm?   
.ch p1  
Have a stack of term papers covering your bedroom floor?
.ch p2  
As a matter of fact -- yes. 
.ch p1  
So, the determinist sees fit to use a specific pre-established situation, eh?   
Is that fair -- philosophically speaking?   
.ch p2  
We could go somewhere a little more private and discuss it. 
.ch p1  
True enough.
Any idea where? 
.ch p2  
Well, my floor is covered in term papers... 
.ch p1  
I wonder if anyone's using the faculty lounge?  
.ad 
(THEY BEGIN TO WANDER OFF STAGE)
.ch p2  
You spontaneous and uncontrolled professor, you!
.ch p1  
Nonsense.   
It was an idea created within my mind.  
.ch p2  
Like my sparkling blue eyes.
.ch p1  
Hmmm...
