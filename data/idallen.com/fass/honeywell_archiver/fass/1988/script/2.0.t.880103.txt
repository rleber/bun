.ch jn  
I never mentioned the cow.

You were thinking about it. 
I admit that I've had the occasional indiscretion --
.ch jn  
One hundred and sixty-two.  
But who's counting? 
.ch jp  
...the occasional indiscretion, but this time, I'm innocent.
It's not my fault!  
Cupid was practicing and he hit me and this Jersey cow. 
By accident.
You know what an awful shot he is!  
.ch jn  
What a pity he just happens to be away right now, so I can't ask him
about it myself.
How dreadfully inconvenient for you.
.ch jp  
Juno, darling, you know I would never lie to you.   
I always tell you the complete truth about all my affairs, after
you find out.   
.ch jn  
Did I say I didn't believe you? 
I just find it interesting that the one time you claim to be innocent,  
the only witness is off on Earth, where 
.ul 
you 
sent him.   
.ch jp  
You 
.ul 
don't   
believe me! 
I'll show you.  
I'll go get Cupid myself and he'll prove I am telling the complete truth.
