THIS SCENE IS VERY MUCH A CARTOON AND SHOULD BE PERFORMED THAT WAY)

(THE STAGE IS DARK. 
WHEN THE LIGHTS COME ON, THIS IS WHAT WE WILL SEE:  
THE STAGE ITSELF IS BARE EXCEPT FOR A BAR.  
THE BAR MUST BE A FAIR LENGTH.  
THERE SHOULD BE A COUPLE OF PIECES OF PAPER ON IT, MAYBE A TRAY 
OF PEANUTS.

INSIDE THE BAR ARE SIX GLASSES. 
.prip "SIX GLASSES" 
IN FRONT OF THE BAR IS A STOOL.

SLOT RIGHT IS WHERE THE FACULTY GROUP BEGINS;   
LASZLO, EMMANUEL, CATHERINE, TERRY, SANDY AND GABRIEL.  
THERE IS AN EASEL THERE WITH A PAD OF PAPER WITH THE WORD 'PLAN'
ON IT.  
AROUND THEM ARE SCATTERED PIECES OF EQUIPMENT WHICH WILL BE USED TO ARMOUR  
THE WHEELCHAIR, AND A MOTORCYCLE HELMET.
.prip "WHEELCHAIR ARMOURING EQUIPMENT"  
.prip "MOTORCYCLE HELMET"

SLOT LEFT IS WHERE THE PROTESTORS BEGIN:
BELLA, IRMA, TYRONE, MUFFY, TOM, HARRY, BENTON, WAYNE, IKE, TY AND JUDE.
THEY HAVE AN EASEL IDENTICAL TO THAT OF THE FACULTY'S.  
THEY HAVE SOME CHEMICAL GLASSWARE AND A BOMB.

THESE TOSSES SHOULD BE FANCY (FROM BEHIND BACK, BETWEEN LEGS,   
BOUNCED OFF INSIDE OF ELBOW).   
ONLY TWO OR THREE ARE NEEDED; IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THEY GET INTO THE
WASTEBASKET.
SHE THEN JUGGLES APPLES (IF THERE ARE APPLES) OR TOSSES A   
PEANUT AND CATCHES IT IN HER MOUTH)

LASZLO/IRMA FLIPS THE PAGE ON THE EASEL.
NEW PAGE ON FACULTY'S SAYS 'BATTERING RAM' AND HAS A FOOTBALL PLAY  
DIAGRAM ON IT;  
NEW PAGE ON PROTESTORS' SAYS 'EXPLOSIVES' AND HAS A FOOTBALL PLAY   
DIAGRAM.
LASZLO/IRMA POINTS TO THE FOOTBALL PLAY DIAGRAM AND BEGINS TO MARK IT,  
FACULTY IS USING THE X'S, PROTESTORS ARE USING THE O'S. 
AFTER A FEW SECONDS SANDY/TYRONE IS POINTED TO AND GETS UP AND MARKS
A MOVE. 
LASZLO/IRMA RESPONDS.   
SANDY/TYRONE MAKES ANOTHER MOVE.
ON BOTH SIDES, THE PAIR BLOCK THE AUDIENCE'S VIEW OF THE EASEL AS THEY  
MAKE FRANTIC MARKS. 
THEN THEY STEP ASIDE FROM THE EASEL;
SANDY/TYRONE HAS JUST FINISHED WINNING A GAME OF TIC-TAC-TOE.

PAY ATTENTION NOW, BECAUSE THIS SECTION COULD DEVELOP SEVERE
FOCUS PROBLEMS. 
FACULTY SIDE GOES FIRST, THEN PROTESTORS SIDE.  
FACULTY SIDE BUILDS THE EVEREST & JENNINGS PATENTED ALUMNI DANCE
DISRUPTOR BY

DISRUPTOR BY ARMORING THE WHEELCHAIR.   
PROTESTORS BUILD A BOMB WITH NITROGLYCERINE.
LAST THING TO GO ON WHEELCHAIR IS MOTORCYCLE HELMET ON GOLDSTEIN.   
THEY RAP ON HIS HEAD.   
LAST THING IRMA DOES IS TILT THE BOTTLE WITH THE EXPLOSIVE TO DROP  
ONE DROP ON FLOOR)

THEIR SLOT. 
PROTESTORS BACK UPSTAGE (THEY'RE FACING THE AUDIENCE), THEN STOP AND
TURN TO LOOK OFFSTAGE.  
FACULTY ENTERS ON OTHER SIDE AND DOES SAME THING.   
BOTH SIDES TURN TO FACE AUDIENCE, THEN SLOWLY DO 360 DEGREE TURN STARTING   
WITH OFF-STAGE FACING.  
THEN THEY TURN BACK AND FACE EACH OTHER AND DO A TAKE.

ED AND MOLLY ENTER, GO TO CENTRE STAGE, AND MAKE GIGANTIC "HALT" MOTIONS.   
EVERYONE STOPS FOR A MICROSECOND.   
.sp 
THEN THE FACULTY CHARGES, PUSHING THE WHEELCHAIR AT THE PROTESTORS, 
SCATTERING THE MARTIAL ARTISTS AND ED AND MOLLY LIKE TEN-PINS.  
THE PROTESTORS RUN TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STAGE.   
ED AND MOLLY RETREAT BACKSTAGE AND HIDE BENEATH THE BAR.
(DEPENDING ON HOW THE TIMING WORKS, THERE MAY BE TIME FOR THE WHEELCHAIR


TO CHARGE AGAIN.)   
BOTH SIDES STARE AT EACH OTHER.

BELLA SAUNTERS UP TO THE BAR.   
SO DOES LASZLO.

BELLA PICKS HERS UP, THROWS IT IN LASZLO'S FACE.

GABE AND HARRY BOTH GO UP TO THE BAR.   
DRINKS ARE SET UP.  
EACH PICKS UP HIS DRINK.

GABE DRINKS HIS DRINK, THEN TAKES HARRY'S DRINK AND SITS DOWN.  
HARRY GOES BACK TO THE PROTESTORS.

SANDY AND TERRY GO UP TOGETHER. 
THEY WAIT.  
IRMA WALKS HALFWAY UP, THEN STOPS AND THREATENS THEM WITH THE BOMB. 
SHE WALKS FORWARD A LITTLE AND THEY BACK UP.

IRMA THROWS THE BOMB.   
GABE (AT THE BAR) CATCHES IT AND DROPS IT INTO THE WASTEBASKET.

INGA PICKS UP THE WASTEBASKET AND TURNS IT UPSIDE DOWN ON   
THE BAR, THEN SHOWS THAT IT IS THREE NESTED WASTEBASKETS.

INGA NOW MIXES UP THE WASTEBASKETS (THIS IS THE 
PEA-UNDER-THE-SHELLS TRICK).
TERRY CHOOSES A WASTEBASKET.
NO BOMB.
NOW IRMA TRIES. 
NO BOMB.
SANDY TRIUMPHANTLY PICKS UP THE THIRD WASTEBASKET AND GRABS THE BOMB.   
.sp 
THE FACULTY (EXCEPT FOR GABE, WHO REMAINS AT THE BAR FOR THE REMAINDER  
OF THE OVERTURE) CHASE THE PROTESTORS OFF STAGE.
THEN THE PROTESTORS (WITH THE BOMB) CHASE THE FACULTY AND THE WHEELCHAIR
ACROSS THE STAGE.   
THEN THE WHEELCHAIR CHASES THE FACULTY AND THE PROTESTORS ACROSS THE
STAGE.  
.sp 
A MOMENT OF INACTION (WHILE THE TECHIES ARE FRANTICALLY TURNING AROUND  
THE WHEELCHAIR).
THEN THE WHEELCHAIR, WITH THE BOMB ON IT, ROLLS ACROSS THE STAGE,   
UPSTAGE OF THE BAR.

ENTER THE VOLUNTEERS:   
EUSTACE, FLORENCE, HERB, LANCE, JOHNSON, BULL, PRISCILLA, RALPH, NORTON,
PENNY, WALTER, GAYLE, AVERY, AND SYLVIA.
ALL OF THEM SNEAK AROUND AND TRY TO HIDE.   
SINCE THERE'S ALMOST NOTHING ON THE STAGE, THEY ARE NOT VERY
SUCCESSFUL. 
.sp 
CUPID ENTERS, DRAWS BOW AND FIRES AT GABE AND INGA. 
MISSES. 
STEPS CLOSER, FIRES, AND MISSES AGAIN.  
AT POINT BLANK RANGE, CUPID PULLS BACK...   
AND BOWSTRING SNAPS (OR BOW BREAKS, IF THAT LOOKS BETTER).  
FINALLY CUPID THROWS DOWN THE BOW AND STABS EACH OF THEM WITH AN
ARROW, THEN STALKS OFF-STAGE.

THE PROTESTORS REENTER AT THIS POINT.   
PROTESTORS AND VOLUNTEERS PAIR OFF TO FIGHT, MANO-A-MANO.   
THESE PAIRS CORRESPOND WITH THEIR MATCHINGS LATER.  
SOME OF THESE PAIRS ARE PEOPLE ON THE SAME SIDE;
NO ONE WILL NOTICE. 
THIS IS HAPPENING TOO FAST.

EVERYONE FIGHTS FOR JUST A FEW SECONDS, THEN THEY ALL FREEZE AS HE  
SHOOTS THEM ALL, AND THE FIGHT BECOMES A BRIEF BALLROOM DANCE.
