Not the worst I've heard.

MAXIE:  
I'll find a hapless soul, and sap his life  
You feast upon the girl next door, my lovely wife   
But human flesh is hard to chew, so bring a knife   
We'll dine out together 
.ve 5   
GLEEP:  
We'll cook Niagara Falls for our honeymoon  
The screams of pain will harmonize a lovely tune
You'll want to take in every drop, so use a spoon   
We'll dine out together

MAXIE:  
Take a herd of humans,  
collect all the blood that you can drain
Add some sparkling water,   
and you've got a flood of pink champagne
.ve 5   
GLEEP:  
And when we get a visit from the stork  
I'll raise a toast to happiness, you pop the cork   
Each hungry tot provided with a little fork 
We'll dine out together 
.ve 2   
BOTH:
