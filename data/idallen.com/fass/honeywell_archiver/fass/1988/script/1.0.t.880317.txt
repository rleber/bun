.sb "Make A Date With FASS 88" "Jack's Original #1" 
.ve 6   
From the Gods above 
To the earth below  
Comes a tale of love
Comes a tale of woe 
An epic tale of "Man-meets-Mate"
In the FASS show eighty-eight   
.ve 6   
Come and watch the folks
Down in Waterloo
All the guys are geeks  
And the gals are few
Romance won't be left to fate   
In the FASS show eighty-eight   
.ve 5   
All the movie screens show countless scenes of  
          love and romance  
Where the hero always wins out in the end   
But the lights come up and interrupt your fantasy land  
You discover that it's all just pretend 
.ve 6   
If you're all alone 
On a Friday night   
No one left to phone
No one else in sight
Come on out and make a date 
With the FASS show eighty-eight 
.ve 4   
Ever since the world began  
Men and women have searched for love in vain

Even Adam and Eve found it hard to conceive 
That in the future they would raise cain    
.ve 5   
Time has changed the way we look
But the things that we want are still the same  
Some people want money  
Some wanna be funny 
But we all want to win the dating game, so  
.ve 4   
Let the show begin  
Let the plot advance
Let the spell of FASS   
Put you in a trance 
.ve 3

In the FASS show eighty-eight...
