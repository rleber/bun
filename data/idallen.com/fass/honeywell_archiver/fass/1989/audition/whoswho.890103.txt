.bs a 13 "WHO'S WHO by Judith Viorst"   
.ve 4   
Paula is the prettiest -- the whole sixth grade agrees. 
Jean's the genius -- that is undeniable.
Most popular is Amy.  Most admired is Louise.   
But as for me, they say I'm most... reliable.   
.ve 4   
Lisa's the best listener -- she always lends an ear.
And all the boys say Meg's the most desirable.  
Gwen's the giggliest -- but everybody thinks that's dear.   
Who thinks it's dear to be the most reliable?   
.ve 4   
Jody and Rebecca tie for cleverest.  Marie  
Is best at sports (and also most perspirable).  
Cathy is the richest -- she's been saving since she's three.
But who'll save me from being most reliable?
.ve 4   
I'd rather be most mischevious.  I'd rather be most deep.   
I'd rather -- and I'll swear this on a Bible -- 
Be known as most peculiar.  Nothing puts the world to sleep 
Like someone who is known as most reliable.
