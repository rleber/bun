.ch wi  
Ah, there you are, William. 
Beautiful day, isn't it?
.ch rb  
Quite so -- the shine is sunning, the chirds are burping -- 
lovers are killing and booing... it makes one glide to be a lav!
.ch wi  
It's just as well you're in a good mood.  Because look what the 
laundry did to your best shirt. 
.ch rb  
Good Heavens.  They've freed the slaves!
.ch wi  
Frayed the sleeves, dear.   
.ch rb  
I did that, saidn't I?  
.ch wi  
They've also torn the collar and smashed all the buttons.   
.ch rb  
Quite so!  It never pains but it roars.  Buttons, collar and
sleeves at one swell foop!  Well, I'll fight them nooth and tail!   
Naith and tool!  I'll go down and smith them to smashereens.  I'm   
going to tump in a jaxi!
.ch wi  
William -- wait!  Surely such a scene would be unseemly for a man   
of your calling?
.ch rb  
You're quite right, my dear.  After all, I  
.ul 
am  
a clan of the moth.  Better to let sleeping logs die.  To hue is
ermine. 

.ch wi  
That's better.  Do you feel like some breakfast?
.ch rb  
Indood I dee!  A suggestion to warm the hartles of my -- cockles
of my heart.  I rather fancy some hot toatered bust, a rasher of
strakey beacon, and some of that cereal that goes pap, snockle  
and crap.   
.ch wi  
Very well, William.  And while you're eating it, I shall be 
packing my trunk.   
.ch rb  
Tracking your punk? 
.ch wi  
Yes, William, you see, I'm leaving you. 
.ch rb  
Leaving me after 20 years of bedded wiss?  This must be some
rather jathetic poke.  You can't mean suddenly to destroy my
entire lay of wife! 
.ch wi  
I'm quite serious, William.  I'm leaving and I'm not coming back.   
.ch rb  
But my dear, consider the word of the Highly Boble:  "What God  
hath joined together, let no son put Amanda."  Er... "Let no pan
soot amunder"... Dear me, I'm getting my tang all tungled!  
.ch wi  
Exactly.
That's why I'm leaving you. 
.ch rb  
What do you mean?   
.ch wi  
It's quite simple, William.  I can't spoon any more Standerisms!
