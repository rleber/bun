.ch si  
...One went to Cruft's, 
and 
.ul 
guess   
who one saw?
.ch fi  
Who?
.ch si  
Buffy.  
.ch fi  
One is  
.ul 
so  
pleased to see one's old chums again, isn't one?
.ch si  
Had one heard?  
.ch fi  
What?   
.ch si  
He won a prize! 
.ch fi  
No!  Fancy one of one's old chums winning one!  
.ch si  
Yes, one wonders if one's ever known one win one.   
.ch fi  
...Pardon?  
.ch si  
One said... one wonders when one's known one win one.   
.ch fi  
...But one's won one once   
.ul 
oneself.
.ch si  
One's won one once oneself?!  Darling, how clever of one!   
.ch fi  
No, not one.
.ul 
One.
.ad 
(FIONA INDICATES SIMON) 
.ch si  
Oh, 
.ul 
one!
Oh yes, 
.ul 
one's   
won one, yes.   
But one thought one had said one had won one.   
.ch fi  
No darling, 
.ul 
one.
.ch si  
But surely... when one's said one's won one, one means  
.ul 
oneself 
doesn't one... not that someone 
.ul 
other   
than oneself has won one.   
.ch fi  
No, when one wants, one can mean not one oneself but... um...   
another geezer. 
.ch si  
...Pardon?  
.ch fi  
Sorry darling!  Someone other than the one one means, when one  
means one   
.ul 
other   
than one oneself.   
.ch si  
...Oh, one sees!
.ch fi  
One's so glad.

When one's with one's darling... one feels one's... one.

No.  One's  
.ul

Oh!  At one with
.ul

Not at one with...
