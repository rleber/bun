.bs a 2 "THE FROG (1) by Hilaire Belloc"
.ve 13  
Be kind and tender to the frog, 
And do not call him names,  
As 'Slimy skin,' or 'Polly-wog,'
Or likewise 'Ugly James,'   
Or 'Gap-a-grin', or 'Toad-gone-wrong,'  
Or 'Bill Bandy-knees':  
The frog is justly sensitive
To epithets like these. 
No animal will more repay   
A treatment kind and fair;  
At least so lonely people say   
Who keep a frog (and, by the way,   
They are extremely rare.)
