.bs a 8 "NO by Judith Viorst"   
.ve 6   
No.  I refuse to.   
No.  I don't choose to. 
No.  I most certainly don't.
You've made a mistake   
If you thought you could make   
Me.  No no no -- I won't.   
.ve 6   
No.  You could beat me. 
No.  You could eat me   
Up from my head to my toes, 
And inside your belly,  
Loudly and yelly,   
I'd keep saying no's.   
.ve 6   
No.  You could sock me, 
Feed me some broccoli,  
Tickle me till I turned blue,   
But in between giggles  
And sniggles and wriggles   
I'd say no to you.  
.ve 6   
No.  You could tease me,
Please, pretty please, me,  
Cry till your eyes washed away. 
You could beg till you're old,  
But I'd look at you cold.   
En-oh is what I'd say.  
.ve 7   
No.  You could shove me.
No.  You could love me  
With kisses all squishy and wet.
You could scratch me with claws 
But I'd say no, because 
...because... because...
I forget!
