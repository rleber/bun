   on the couch?  See Daddy's hair.  Daddy needs a  haircut.
   Poor  Daddy.   Daddy  has  no money for a haircut.  Daddy
   spends all his money to buy you toys and  oatmeal.   Poor
   Daddy.   Daddy  can not have a haircut.  Poor poor Daddy.
   See the scissors...  Poor poor poor poor Daddy.  


2-NARRATOR:  K is for Kidnapper.  See  the  nice  kidnapper.
   The  kidnapper  has a lollipop.  The kidnapper has a keen
   car.  The car can go fast.  Tell the nice kidnapper  that



   your Daddy has lots of money.  Then maybe he will let you
   ride in his car. 


3-NARRATOR:  O is for Oz.  Do you want to visit the  wonder-
   ful  far-off  land  of  oz,  where  the  wizard lives and
   scarecrows can dance and  the  road  is  made  of  yellow
   bricks  and everything is emerald green?  Well, you _c_a_n'_t
   because there is no land of Oz and there is no tin woods-
   man  and  there is no Santa Claus!  Maybe someday you can
   go to Detroit.
