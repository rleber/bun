   another edition of Top Of The Form.  And this week  we're








   at  the semi-final stage and tonight's contest is between
   the boys of the King Arthur's  Grammar  School,  Podmoor,
   and  the  girls  of  the St Maria Kangarooboot the Second
   County High School and a half.   


(TWO SECONDS' FRENETIC RECORDED ECHOING APPLAUSE)   


   And so, without further ado, let's go  straight  on  with
   round two.  Brian -- what is the name of the meat that we
   get from pigs?   


222-BBBRRRIIIAAANNN:  Pork. 


3-QUESTION:  Good, that's two marks to you,  Brian.   Tracey
   --  what  is the name of the metal alloy we get from zinc
   and copper?  


444-TTTRRRAAACCCEEEYYY:  Brass.   


5-QUESTION:  No, I'm afraid not.  The answer's pork.   Kevin
   -- what is the capital of Australia? 


666-KKKEEEVVVIIINNN:  Sydney?   


7-QUESTION:  No, no, the capital of Australia is pork.  Now,
   Arthura -- who wrote _A _T_a_l_e _o_f _T_w_o _C_i_t_i_e_s?   


888-AAARRRTTTHHHUUURRRAAA:  ...Pork?


9-QUESTION:  Good.  It's two marks to you.   And  so  on  to
   Stig's  question.   Stig  -- what was the date of Captain






   Cook's discovery of Australia?   


111000-SSSTTTIIIGGG:  Pork! 


11-QUESTION:  Good.  It's two marks to  you,  and  the  last

111222-CCCYYYNNNTTTHHHIIIAAA:  Pork!! 


13-QUESTION:   Good.   Two  marks to you.  That's the end of
   round two and the score is four points to each school.   


(TWO SECONDS' APPLAUSE) 


   And straight on to round _t_w_o.  Brian -- what is the  name  
   that we give to the meat we get from pigs?   


14-BRIAN:  Pork!!!! 


15-QUESTION:  No.  You're guessing, aren't you?  The meat we
   get from pigs is called...  _B_a_g_h_d_a_d.  Your question next,  
   Tracey.  What is the capital of Iraq?


16-TRACEY:  Baghdad.


17-QUESTION:   No.   Nearly.   The  capital of Iraq is Rome.










   Kevin -- what is the capital of Italy?   


18-KEVIN:  ...Paris?


19-QUESTION:  No, the capital of Italy is Tokyo.  Arthura --
   what is the capital of Japan?


20-ARTHURA:  ...Washington? 


21-QUESTION:   Good!!   Two marks to you.  Stig, what is the
   capital of the United States of America? 


22-STIG:  Sydney.   


23-QUESTION:  Well...   


24-BRIAN:  Canberra!


25-QUESTION:  Jolly good, two to you.  And finally,  Cynthia
   -- what's the capital of Australia?  


26-CYNTHIA:  Pork?  


27-QUESTION:   Well done!  Well done indeed!!  And the score
   at the end of round two is, um... er...  


(ONE SECOND'S APPLAUSE) 


   And on with round three.  Brian -- what is the difference
   between a monsoon... and a mongoose? 


28-BRIAN:  A mongoose is a long white plastic pole which you
   hang out of your window to frighten birds away...  and  a
   monsoon  is  a  spring- loaded medieval Hungarian stomach
   pump.

29-QUESTION:  ...No, I can only give you a half for that.   


30-BRIAN:  Brussels?!   


31-QUESTION:   No,  not  Brussels.  Well tried, though.  No,
   the answer is, a monsoon is a _w_i_n_d, and a mongoose _i_s_n'_t.
   Stig -- what's the capital of North Korea?   


32-STIG:  Pyong Yang.   


33-QUESTION:   Yes,  but  I'm  not giving you any points for
   that because nobody likes a clever dick.  So  that's  the
   end of that round and the score is... um... is...


(HALF A SECOND'S APPLAUSE)  


   Now  on  to  round  four  which is all about butterflies.
   Tracey -- your question about butterflies is... who wrote
   _J_a_n_e _E_y_r_e?   


34-TRACEY:  Red Admiral?...  Cabbage White?... Fritillary?  


35-QUESTION:  No, no you're on the wrong track here.


36-TRACEY:  Pork?   


37-QUESTION:   No,  the  answer  is the Taj Mahal.  No!  No,
   sorry, I got a bit muddled there.  The answer is in  fact
   Bruseels,  but I can give you one for Cabbage White.  Now
   that brings the score even, and there's only time for one
   more  question,  and  whichever school gets this question
   right goes into the final.   



333888-AAALLLLLL:  Pork!  Pork!!  Pork!  Pork!!!!!


39-QUESTION:  No, no.  No, quiet please.  Here's  the  ques-
   tion.  Ready?  Who shuffled my question cards just before
   transmission?


444000-AAALLLLLL BBBUUUTTT TTTRRRAAACCCEEEYYY:  Tracey!
