   Paula is the prettiest -- the whole sixth grade agrees.  
   Jean's the genius -- that is undeniable. 
   Most popular is Amy.  Most admired is Louise.
   But as for me, they say I'm most... reliable.


   Lisa's the best listener -- she always lends an ear. 
   And all the boys say Meg's the most desirable.   
   Gwen's the giggliest -- but everybody thinks that's dear.
   Who thinks it's dear to be the most reliable?


   Jody and Rebecca tie for cleverest.  Marie   
   Is best at sports (and also most perspirable).   
   Cathy is the richest -- she's been saving since she's three. 
   But who'll save me from being most reliable? 


   I'd rather be most mischevious.  I'd rather be most deep.



   I'd rather -- and I'll swear this on a Bible --  
   Be known as most peculiar.  Nothing puts the world to sleep  
   Like someone who is known as most reliable.
