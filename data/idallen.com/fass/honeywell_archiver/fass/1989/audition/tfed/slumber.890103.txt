111-MMMAAADDDEEELLLIIINNNEEE:  ...so then, the man gets bare naked in bed with
   you and you both go to sleep which is why  they  call  it
   sleeping  together.   Then  you  both wake up and the man
   says, "Why  don't  you  slip  into  something  more  com-
   fortable?"  --  no, wait, maybe that comes before -- it's










   not important -- and then the man says...


222-MMMOOOTTTHHHEEERRR:  Gilda, it's five A.M.  When does the noise stop? 


333-GGGIIILLLDDDAAA:  We're just going to sleep, Mother.


4-MOTHER:  What are you talking about at this hour? 


5-GILDA:  School!   


6-MOTHER:  Well, save it for the morning.   


777-JJJAAANNNEEE:  And then the man...


8-MOTHER:  Anyway... then the man...  (WHISPERS)  ...in  you
   and  then  you  scream  and then he screams and then it's
   over.


999-LLLAAARRRAAAIIINNNEEE:  That's disgusting!  


10-GILDA:  You lie, Madeline.   


11-MADELINE:  Cross my heart and hope to  die.   My  brother
   told me in my driveway.  


12-GILDA:  Your brother lies, Madeline. 


13-MADELINE:  No, sir.  


14-JANE:   Come  on.   Isn't he the one who said if you chew
   your nails and swallow them, a hand  will  grow  in  your
   stomach? 


15-MADELINE:  Well, it's also true because I read it in this
   book.


16-JANE:  What'd it say?

17-MADELINE:  It said, "The first step in human reproduction
   is... the man...  (WHISPERS) 


18-LARAINE:  It's disgusting!   


(LARAINE, GILDA, AND JANE ALL DO FAKE THROWING UP)  


19-MADELINE:  It's true.


20-JANE:  Well, I  just  know  it  can't  be  true,  because
   nothing that sickening is true.  


21-MADELINE:  Boogers are true. 


22-GILDA:   Well,  I mainly don't believe it because I heard
   from my sister about this girl who this  guy  jumped  out
   from the bushes and forced to have a baby.   


23-MADELINE:  How?  


24-GILDA:  I don't know.  I think he just said, "Have a baby
   right now."  


25-MADELINE:  Oh, sure, Gilda.  And  you  think  that  would
   work if I tried it on you?   


26-GILDA:  Hey, don't.  O.K.?   


27-MADELINE:  Well, don't worry.  It wouldn't because that's
   not how it's done.  How it's done is... the man...   


28-LARAINE:  Don't say it again, O.K.?  I just  ate  half  a
   pizza, O.K.? 


29-GILDA:  So that's why people were born naked.


30-JANE:  Yeah. 





31-LARAINE:  But how could you face the man after?  Wouldn't
   you be _s_o _e_m_b_a_r_r_a_s_s_e_d? 


32-JANE:  I'd have to kill myself right after.   I  mean,  I
   get  embarrassed when I think how people standing next to
   me can see inside my ear.


33-MADELINE:  Well, that's why you should only do  it  after
   you're married.  Because then you won't be so embarrassed
   in front of your husband after,  because  you're  in  the
   same _f_a_m_i_l_y. 


34-LARAINE:   Oh,  well,  I  really want to get married now.
   _N_o_t!   


35-MADELINE:  But the worst thing is -- your _p_a_r_e_n_t_s do  it,  
   you know?

36-GILDA:  Come on! 


37-MADELINE:  Gilda, think:  none of us would be here unless
   our parents did it _a_t _l_e_a_s_t _o_n_c_e.  


38-JANE:  My parents did  it  at  least  twice.   I  have  a
   sister.  


39-GILDA:   And  my  parents did it at least three times.  I
















   have a sister _a_n_d a brother.   But,  like,  I  know  they  
   didn't do it because they _w_a_n_t_e_d to.  They did it because
   they _h_a_d to.  To have children.


40-MADELINE:  They could have adopted children. 


41-GILDA:  Yeah, but adopted children are a pain.  You  have
   to teach them how to look like you.  


42-LARAINE:   Well,  my  father would never do anything like
   that to my mother.  He's too polite. 


43-MADELINE:  My father's polite, and we have six kids. 


44-LARAINE:  He's obviously not as polite as you think. 


45-JANE:  I wonder whose idea this was. 


46-MADELINE:  God's.


47-JANE:  Oh, come on.  God doesn't go  around  thinking  up
   sickening things like this for people to do. 


48-GILDA:   Maybe  God just wants you to do it so you'll ap-
   preciate how good the _r_e_s_t of your life is.  


49-JANE:  Maybe.


50-LARAINE:  How long does it take? 


51-MADELINE:  Stupid!  That depends on how  big  the  girl's
   stomach is and how fast she can digest.  


52-GILDA:  Oh.  


53-JANE:  Can you talk during it?   











54-MADELINE:   You  have  to  hold  your  breath  or else it
   doesn't work.


55-JANE:  Well, I'm just telling my husband I'm not going to
   do it.  Tough beansies.  


56-MADELINE:  What if he says he'll get divorced from you if
   you didn't do it?

57-JANE:  I would never marry someone like that.


58-MADELINE:   What  if you did by accident?  What if... you
   met him in a war and married him real  fast  because  you
   felt sorry for him since he'd probably get killed only he
   didn't and you were stuck with him?  


59-GILDA:  Look -- let's make this pact right now that after
   we get married, if our husbands make us do it, we'll call
   each other on the phone every day and talk a lot to  help
   keep our minds off it, like our mothers do.  


60-JANE:  Right.


61-MADELINE:  Right.


62-LARAINE:  Right, because it's _d_i_s_g_u_s_t_i_n_g.


63-JANE:   Well,  don't worry, we'll never have to keep this
   pact, because I'll never do it.  



64-GILDA:  Me, neither. 


65-MADELINE:  Me, neither.  


66-LARAINE:  I might.
