(SETTING:   A  ROMANTICALLY  LIT  TABLE  AT  A   FASHIONABLE
RESTAURANT) 


111-SSSIIIMMMOOONNN:  ...One went to Cruft's, and _g_u_e_s_s who one saw?  


222-FFFIIIOOONNNAAA:  Who?  


3-SIMON:  Buffy.


4-FIONA:   One  is  _s_o pleased to see one's old chums again,
   isn't one?   


5-SIMON:  Had one heard?


6-FIONA:  What? 


7-SIMON:  He won a prize!   


8-FIONA:  No!  Fancy one of one's old chums winning one!


9-SIMON:  Yes, one wonders if one's ever known one win one. 


10-FIONA:  ...Pardon?   



11-SIMON:  One said... one wonders when one's known one  win
   one. 


12-FIONA:  ...But one's won one once _o_n_e_s_e_l_f. 


13-SIMON:  One's won one once oneself?!  Darling, how clever
   of one!  


14-FIONA:  No, not one.  _O_n_e. 


(FIONA INDICATES SIMON) 


15-SIMON:  Oh, _o_n_e!  Oh yes, _o_n_e'_s won one,  yes.   But  one  
   thought one had said one had won one.


16-FIONA:  No darling, _o_n_e.   


17-SIMON:   But surely... when one's said one's won one, one
   means _o_n_e_s_e_l_f doesn't one... not that someone _o_t_h_e_r  than
   oneself has won one.

18-FIONA:   No, when one wants, one can mean not one oneself
   but... um...  another geezer.


19-SIMON:  ...Pardon?   


20-FIONA:  Sorry darling!  Someone other than  the  one  one
   means, when one means one _o_t_h_e_r than one oneself.  


21-SIMON:  ...Oh, one sees! 


22-FIONA:  One's so glad.   










(SIMON TAKES FIONA'S HAND TENDERLY) 


23-SIMON:   When  one's  with  one's  darling...  one  feels
   one's... one.


24-FIONA:  One won _w_h_a_t?


25-SIMON:  No.  One's _a_t one... 


26-FIONA:  Oh!  At one with _o_n_e_s_e_l_f.  


27-SIMON:  Not at one with...  _o_n_e.   


(FIONA SMILES)  


28-FIONA:  One so agrees.   


(SIMON LOOKS DEEPLY INTO FIONA'S EYES)  


29-SIMON:  ...One loves one, darling.   


30-FIONA:  One loves one too.   


(SHE KISSES HIS HAND)   


31-SIMON:  ...Where was one darling?


32-FIONA:  One  was  saying  one's  wife  didn't  understand
   one...
