111-WWWIIIFFFEEE:  Ah, there you are, William.  Beautiful  day,  isn't
   it?  


222-SSSPPPOOOOOONNNEEERRR:  Quite so -- the shine is sunning, the chirds are
   burping -- lovers are killing and booing... it makes  one
   glide to be a lav!   


3-WIFE:   It's  just as well you're in a good mood.  Because
   look what the laundry did to your best shirt.


4-SPOONER:  Good Heavens.  They've freed the slaves!


5-WIFE:  Frayed the sleeves, dear.  


6-SPOONER:  I did that, saidn't I?  








7-WIFE:  They've also torn the collar and  smashed  all  the
   buttons. 


8-SPOONER:   Quite  so!   It never pains but it roars.  But-
   tons, collar and sleeves at one swell foop!   Well,  I'll
   fight them nooth and tail!  Naith and tool!  I'll go down
   and smith them to smashereens.  I'm going to  tump  in  a
   jaxi!


9-WIFE:   William -- wait!  Surely such a scene would be un-
   seemly for a man of your calling?


10-SPOONER:  You're quite right, my dear.  After all, I _a_m a
   clan  of  the moth.  Better to let sleeping logs die.  To
   hue is ermine.   


11-WIFE:  That's better.  Do you feel like some breakfast?  


12-SPOONER:  Indood I dee!  A suggestion to warm the hartles
   of  my  --  cockles of my heart.  I rather fancy some hot
   toatered bust, a rasher of strakey beacon,  and  some  of
   that cereal that goes pap, snockle and crap. 


13-WIFE:  Very well, William.  And while you're eating it, I
   shall be packing my trunk.   


14-SPOONER:  Tracking your punk?


15-WIFE:  Yes, William, you see, I'm leaving you.

16-SPOONER:  Leaving me after 20 years of bedded wiss?  This
   must be some rather jathetic poke.  You can't  mean  sud-
   denly to destroy my entire lay of wife!  


17-WIFE:   I'm  quite serious, William.  I'm leaving and I'm
   not coming back. 


18-SPOONER:  But my dear, consider the word  of  the  Highly
   Boble:   "What  God  hath joined together, let no son put
   Amanda."  Er... "Let no pan soot amunder"... Dear me, I'm
   getting my tang all tungled! 


19-WIFE:  Exactly.  That's why I'm leaving you. 


20-SPOONER:  What do you mean?  


21-WIFE:   It's  quite  simple,  William.  I can't spoon any
   more Standerisms!
