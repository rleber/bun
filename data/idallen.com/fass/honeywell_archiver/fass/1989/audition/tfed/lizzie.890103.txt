   I can't get enoughsky
   Of Lizzie Pitofsky.  
   I love her so much that it hurts.
   I want her so terrible   
   I'd give her my gerbil   
   Plus twenty-two weeks of desserts.   


   I know that it's lovesky 
   'Cause Lizzie Pitofsky   
   Is turning me into a saint.  
   I smell like a rose, 
   I've stopped picking my nose,
   And I practically never say ain't.   


   I don't push and shovesky
   'Cause Lizzie Pitofsky   
   Likes boys who are gentle and kind.  
   I'm not throwing rocks   
   And I'm changing my socks
   (And to tell you the truth I don't mind).


   Put tacks in my shoes,   






   Feed me vinegar juice,   
   And do other mean bad awful stuffsky.
   But promise me this: 
   I won't die without kiss-
   Ing my glorious Lizzie Pitofsky.
