   Mother doesn't want a dog.   
   Mother says they smell,  
   And never sit when you say sit,  
   Or even when you yell.   
   And when you come home late at night 
   And there is ice and snow,   
   You have to go back out because  
   The dumb dog has to go.  


   Mother doesn't want a dog.   
   Mother says they shed,   
   And always let the strangers in  
   And bark at friends instead, 
   And do disgraceful things on rugs,   
   And track mud on the floor,  
   And flop upon your bed at night  
   And snore their doggy snore. 


   Mother doesn't want a dog.   
   She's making a mistake.  
   Because, more than a dog, I think

   She will not want this snake.
