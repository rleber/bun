   No.  I refuse to.
   No.  I don't choose to.  
   No.  I most certainly don't. 
   You've made a mistake
   If you thought you could make
   Me.  No no no -- I won't.


   No.  You could beat me.  
   No.  You could eat me
   Up from my head to my toes,  
   And inside your belly,   
   Loudly and yelly,
   I'd keep saying no's.


   No.  You could sock me,  
   Feed me some broccoli,   
   Tickle me till I turned blue,
   But in between giggles   
   And sniggles and wriggles
   I'd say no to you.   


   No.  You could tease me, 
   Please, pretty please, me,   
   Cry till your eyes washed away.  
   You could beg till you're old,   
   But I'd look at you cold.
   En-oh is what I'd say.   



   No.  You could shove me. 
   No.  You could love me   
   With kisses all squishy and wet. 
   You could scratch me with claws  
   But I'd say no, because  
   ...because... because... 
   I forget!
