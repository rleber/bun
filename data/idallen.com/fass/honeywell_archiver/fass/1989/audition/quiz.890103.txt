isn't.

No, the answer is the Taj Mahal.  No!  No, sorry, I got a bit   
muddled there.  The answer is in fact Bruseels, but I can give  
you one for Cabbage White.  Now that brings the score even, and 
there's only time for one more question, and whichever school   
gets this question right goes into the final.
