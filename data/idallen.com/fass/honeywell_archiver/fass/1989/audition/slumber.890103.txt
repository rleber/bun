...so then, the man gets bare naked in bed with you and you both
go to sleep which is why they call it sleeping together.  Then  
you both wake up and the man says, "Why don't you slip into 
something more comfortable?" -- no, wait, maybe that comes before   
-- it's not important -- and then the man says...   
.ch mo  
Gilda, it's five A.M.  When does the noise stop?
.ch gi  
We're just going to sleep, Mother.  
.ch mo  
What are you talking about at this hour?
.ch gi  
School! 
.ch mo  
Well, save it for the morning.  
.ch ja  
And then the man... 
.ch mo  
Anyway... then the man... (WHISPERS) ...in you and then you 
scream and then he screams and then it's over.  
.ch la  
That's disgusting!  
.ch gi  
You lie, Madeline.  
.ch ma  
Cross my heart and hope to die.  My brother told me in my   
driveway.   
.ch gi  
Your brother lies, Madeline.
.ch ma  
No, sir.
.ch ja  
Come on.  Isn't he the one who said if you chew your nails and  
swallow them, a hand will grow in your stomach? 
.ch ma  
Well, it's also true because I read it in this book.
.ch ja  
What'd it say?  
.ch ma  
It said, "The first step in human reproduction is... the man... 
(WHISPERS)  
.ch la  
It's disgusting!
.ad 
(LARAINE, GILDA, AND JANE ALL DO FAKE THROWING UP)  
.ch ma  
It's true.  
.ch ja  
Well, I just know it can't be true, because nothing that
sickening is true.  
.ch ma  
Boogers are true.   
.ch gi  
Well, I mainly don't believe it because I heard from my sister  
about this girl who this guy jumped out from the bushes and 
forced to have a baby.  
.ch ma  
How?
.ch gi  
I don't know.  I think he just said, "Have a baby right now."   
.ch ma  
Oh, sure, Gilda.  And you think that would work if I tried it on
you?
.ch gi  
Hey, don't.  O.K.?  
.ch ma  
Well, don't worry.  It wouldn't because that's not how it's done.   
How it's done is... the man...  
.ch la  
Don't say it again, O.K.?  I just ate half a pizza, O.K.?   
.ch gi  
So that's why people were born naked.   
.ch ja  
Yeah.   

.ch la  
But how could you face the man after?  Wouldn't you be  
.ul 
so embarrassed? 
.ch ja  
I'd have to kill myself right after.  I mean, I get embarrassed 
when I think how people standing next to me can see inside my   
ear.
.ch ma  
Well, that's why you should only do it after you're married.
Because then you won't be so embarrassed in front of your husband   
after, because you're in the same   
.ul 
family. 
.ch la  
Oh, well, I really want to get married now. 
.ul 
Not!
.ch ma  
But the worst thing is -- your  
.ul 
parents 
do it, you know?
.ch gi  
Come on!
.ch ma  
Gilda, think:  none of us would be here unless our parents did it   
.ul 
at least once.  
.ch ja  
My parents did it at least twice.  I have a sister. 
.ch gi  
And my parents did it at least three times.  I have a sister
.ul 
and 
a brother.  
But, like, I know they didn't do it because they
.ul 
wanted  
to.  They did it because they   
.ul 
had 
to. 
To have children.   
.ch ma  
They could have adopted children.   
.ch gi  
Yeah, but adopted children are a pain.  You have to teach them  
how to look like you.   
.ch la  
Well, my father would never do anything like that to my mother. 
He's too polite.
.ch ma  
My father's polite, and we have six kids.   
.ch la  
He's obviously not as polite as you think.  
.ch ja  
I wonder whose idea this was.   
.ch ma  
God's.  
.ch ja  
Oh, come on.  God doesn't go around thinking up sickening things
like this for people to do. 
.ch gi  
Maybe God just wants you to do it so you'll appreciate how good 
the 
.ul 
rest
of your life is.
.ch ja  
Maybe.  
.ch la  
How long does it take?  
.ch ma  
Stupid!  That depends on how big the girl's stomach is and how  
fast she can digest.
.ch gi  
Oh. 
.ch ja  
Can you talk during it? 
.ch ma  
You have to hold your breath or else it doesn't work.   
.ch ja  
Well, I'm just telling my husband I'm not going to do it.   
Tough beansies. 
.ch ma  
What if he says he'll get divorced from you if you didn't do it?
.ch ja  
I would never marry someone like that.  
.ch ma  
What if you did by accident?  What if... you met him in a war and   
married him real fast because you felt sorry for him since he'd 
probably get killed only he didn't and you were stuck with him? 
.ch gi  
Look -- let's make this pact right now that after we get married,   
if our husbands make us do it, we'll call each other on the phone   
every day and talk a lot to help keep our minds off it, like our
mothers do. 
.ch ja  
Right.  
.ch ma  
Right.  
.ch la  
Right, because it's 
.ul 
disgusting. 
.ch ja  
Well, don't worry, we'll never have to keep this pact, because  
I'll never do it.   
.ch gi  
Me, neither.
.ch ma  
Me, neither.
.ch la  
I might.
