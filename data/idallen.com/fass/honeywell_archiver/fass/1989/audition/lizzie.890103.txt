.bs a 6 "THE LIZZIE PITOFSKY POEM by Judith Viorst" 
.ve 6   
I can't get enoughsky   
Of Lizzie Pitofsky. 
I love her so much that it hurts.   
I want her so terrible  
I'd give her my gerbil  
Plus twenty-two weeks of desserts.  
.ve 6   
I know that it's lovesky
'Cause Lizzie Pitofsky  
Is turning me into a saint. 
I smell like a rose,
I've stopped picking my nose,   
And I practically never say ain't.  
.ve 6   
I don't push and shovesky   
'Cause Lizzie Pitofsky  
Likes boys who are gentle and kind. 
I'm not throwing rocks  
And I'm changing my socks   
(And to tell you the truth I don't mind).   
.ve 6   
Put tacks in my shoes,  
Feed me vinegar juice,  
And do other mean bad awful stuffsky.   
But promise me this:
I won't die without kiss-   
Ing my glorious Lizzie Pitofsky.
