(LIGHTS UP ON FERGIE AND BUCK, AND A TRANSLATOR FOR THE HEARING IMPAIRED.   
NOTE THAT THE TRANSLATOR'S SIGNINGS SHOULD BE TIMED AS IF THE TRANSLATOR
WAS ACTUALLY TRANSLATING WHAT IS BEING SAID)

Welcome back, sports fans, to the Sports Network.   
I'm Buck.

And I'm Fergie. 
.ch tr

And I'm Fergie.

The sky is black, the rain is pouring,  
and it's a beautiful day for baseball...

(SIGNING, AND   
LOOKING A LITTLE STARTLED AS THIS IS TRANSLATED)
The sky is black, the rain is pouring,  
and it's a beautiful day for baseball...
.ch bu  
(POINTING OUT THE WINDOW)   
It's not raining.   
.ch fe  
Shhh.   
.ch tr  
(SIGNING)   
Shhh.   
.ch fe  
(RESUMING)  
The temperature is near-freezing, with a gale-force wind blowing from   
the north-west...   
.ad 
(TRANSLATOR SHOULD NOW POSITION SELF SLIGHTLY BEHIND FERGIE AND 
BUCK AS THE PRECEDING LINE IS TRANSLATED INTO SIGN LANGUAGE.
THIS LEAVES TRANSLATOR IN PERFECT POSITION TO MAKE FACES AT FERGIE AND BUCK 
AS THE FOLLOWING TRANSLATIONS ARE BEING PERFORMED.) 
.ch tr  
(SIGNING)   
Fergie is a blithering idiot, and only those of us who know sign language   
can understand this speech. 
.ch bu  
(POINTING OUT THE WINDOW)   
It's not raining.   
.ch fe  
Just a minute.  
I'm almost done.
.ch tr  
(SIGNING)   
Wait!   
.ch fe  
(RESUMING READING FROM THE SCRIPT)  
And yet, for some reason, the teams have not reappeared on the field.   red Buck, I 

Buck, I don't understand.   
.ch tr  
(SIGNING)   
Isn't it neat that we can say things that most of the audience can't hear?  
.ch bu  
Fergie, it's not raining.   
We're in hell.  
They can't play baseball until it starts raining again. 
.ch tr  
(SIGNING)   
God, this dialogue is awful.
Who wrote this crap anyway? 
.ch fe  
Oh. 
.ch tr  
(EXAGGERATED SIGNING)   
Oh. 
.ch bu  
How long, O Lord, how long? 
.ch go  
(OFFSTAGE)  
Until she gets it right!
.ad 
(FERGIE STARTS TO CRY)  
.ch bu  
Mother told me there would be day like this.
.ch tr  
(SIGNING)   
How many sign language experts does it take to change a light bulb? 
.ch bu  
There, there, don't cry.
.ch tr  
(SIGNING)   
One, as long as he doesn't talk!
Ha! Ha! Ha! 
.ch bu  
(HANDING FERGIE A HANDKERCHIEF) 
Here.   
Fix your face.  
Now repeat after me.
.ch fe  
After me.   
.ch bu  
In the beginning of this big inning,
Bell's the batter and he's bitter about his bunting 
because Bean Ball Bailey's the better bunter
but with Brinkley Bass and Boss Bull on base,   
Bell can't bet on anything but a bunt.  
.ad 
(TRANSLATOR GLARES THEN HOLDS UP SIGN WHICH SAYS 'I quit'   
AND EXITS.  
FERGIE BURSTS INTO TEARS.)  
.ch bu  
Take a deep breath. 
.ad 
(FERGIE TAKES AN EXAGGERATED DEEP BREATH)   
.ex 
Come with me over to the window.
.ad 
(BUCK AND FERGIE MOVE TO ONE SIDE OF THE STAGE  
BUCK REALIZES THAT FERGIE IS STILL HOLDING BREATH   
AND SLAMS FERGIE IN THE DIAPHRAGM.) 
.ex 
Look outside.   
What do you see?
.ch fe  
I see Billy, and Betty, and Susie...
.ch bu  
Not that window.
.ad 
(BUCK TURNS FERGIE TO FACE A DIFFERENT WINDOW.) 
.ch fe  
I see... steam rising from the outfield.
It's kind of romantic, in its own way.  
.ch bu  
I'm sure it is, Fergie. 
Now, tell those good people in television land what's   
happening in the ballgame.  
.ch fe  
Umm... it's the top of the seventh inning with two men on, two men out  
and one finally extinguished.   
.ch bu  
There.  
That wasn't so bad, was it? 
.ch fe  
No. 
Thanks, Buck.   
You're so good to me.   
.ad 
(FERGIE SMILES UP AT BUCK SWEETLY;  
BUCK ELBOWS FERGIE SOMEPLACE SENSITIVE) 
.ch bu  
Let's take time out for these brief commercial messages.
.ld

That hurt!  
.ch bu  
Good!   
.ch fe  
But it was good pain, Buck. 
.ch bu  
Shut up.

(ENTER A NERVOUS YUPPIE (OR WHITNEY HOUSTON LOOKALIKE). 
HE GETS OUT A PIECE OF WAX PAPER AND PUTS IT ON THE FLOOR OR OTHER  
SURFACE.
THEN HE GETS OUT A ZIPLOC BAGGIE FILLED WITH AN ILLICIT WHITE POWDER.   
GINGERLY, HE POURS A LARGE BUT MEASURED AMOUNT OF SAME ONTO THE WAX PAPER.  
THEN, HE PRODUCES (FROM SOMEWHERE) A LARGE JAR LABELLED "LOW-CALORIE
SWEETENER" (OR "ASPARTAME" OR "NUTRA-SWEET").   
HE MIXES THIS IN WITH THE WHITE POWDER. 
THEN, HE TAKES A GENEROUS SNORT, AFTER WHICH HE LOOKS UP
AT THE AUDIENCE, NOSE COVERED IN WHITE POWDER, AND SAYS:)   
.ch hy  
Just for the fun of it -- Diet Coke.

TWO MEN ARE IN IT.  
A CANADIAN FLAG WITH BULLET HOLES IN IT IS BESIDE THE FOXHOLE.)

George? 
.ch m2  
Yeah?   
.ch m1  
I think the coast is clear. 
Take a look.
.ch m2  
No way, buddy.  
You're not getting me to look this time.
.ch m1  
It's your turn, George. 
.ch m2  
Shit.

WHEN HE DOES, THERE ARE LOUD CRIES FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE STAGE)

The Canadian Armed Forces -- there's no life like it.

.ch bu  
Hello yet again, sports fans.   
The field is being drenched by a torrential downpour,   
so play will soon be resumed.   
.ch fe  
(CHILDISHLY)
Buck, I know something you don't know.  
.ch bu  
Fergie, would you knock it off? 
.ch fe  
Promise not to tell anyone? 
.ch bu  
Fergie, stop acting like a child.   
.ch fe  
It's about Magnum P.I.  
.ch bu  
I don't care.   
.ch fe  
Higgins really is Robin Masters!
.ch bu  
I'm not listening...
.ad 
(BUCK PUTS HIS HANDS OVER HIS EARS AND BEGINS HUMMING TO HIMSELF)   
.ch fe  
Buck, that's not nice.

You're being mean.

No, Fergie. 
Don't leave me. 
I can't do this job by myself.  
.ch fe  
Say please. 
.ch bu  
Pretty please with maple sugar on it.   
.ch fe  
Oh... all right.

Your honour, learned council, ladies and gentlemen of the jury: 
I think what I have to say was best said by another man.
A wise man. 
A man I think we've all heard of.   
The quality of mercy is not strained,
