(TO PAM)
Ms. Defensive Attorney, you may cross-pollinate the witless.
.ch pa  
No questions, your Honour.  
.ch ju  
(TO JOE)
Mr. Vial, you may step down.
Mr. Prosecutor, call the next witness.  
.ch li  
The prosecution arrests, your Honour.   
I mean "rests".

.ch ju  
Are you making fun of me?   
.ch li  
No, er...   
.ch ju  
I don't like it when people make fun of me. 
Bailiff, haul this hooligan hurriedly to the hoosegow.  
.ad 
(BRIEF PAUSE.   
EVERYONE LOOKS STUNNED) 
.ex 
How on earth did I manage to say that?  

.ch ba  
I'm sorry, sir. 
I can't arrest this man.
He is not a criminal, he's a lawyer.
.ch jj  
That's funny, I can't tell the difference.  
.ch lg  
Neither can I.  
.ch jj  
Is there a difference?  
.ch ju  
Oh, all right.  
Mr. Prosecutor, please give your closing argument.  
.ch li  
Your Honour, I --   
.ad 
(KAY SHOULDERS HIM ASIDE)   
.ch st  
Out of my way!  I'm doing the closing argument. 
.ch li  
Who says?  I'm the lead lawyer, and I get to do the closing argument,   
and you're not going to stop me.
Besides, I'm a man, and I'm bigger and I'm stronger.
.ch st  
Yeah, but I'm meaner.   
.ad 
(STARES DOWN LIBERTY)   
.ch st  
Members of the jury: you have before you conclusive evidence that proves
beyond a shadow of a doubt with no possibility of contradiction that the
defendant who stands before you is a cold-blooded, heartless, ruthless, 
scheming, conniving killer. 
.ch ju  
Thank you.  
Does the defense wish to call any witnesses?
.ch pa  
Just one, your Honour.  
The defense calls Lucas Spielberg to the stand. 
.ad 
(ENTER SPIELBERG)   
.ch ro  
(TO AUDIENCE, OR TO NO ONE IN PARTICULAR)   
Hi, there.  
Glad to see you.
Hey, you're looking good.   
Let's do lunch sometime.
.ch ba  
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? 
.ch ro  
Hey, if I knew the whole truth, we wouldn't need a trial.   
.ch ba  
All right, then.  Do you swear to tell little bits of the truth?
.ch ro  
No problem. 
.ch ba  
Take the stand. 
.ch ro  
Where should I take it? 
.ch ba  
That's an old joke, sir.
.ch ro  
That's all right -- I'm an old witness. 
.ch pa  
Mr. Spielberg, state your occupation.   
.ch ro  
My name is Lucas Spielberg, producer of stage and screen extravaganzas. 
My card.
.prip "BUSINESS CARD"   
.ch pa  
And you produced the broadcast of the game at which 
His Satanic Victimness was killed, right?   
.ad 
(NOTE:  AT THIS POINT, TECHIES ENTER AND MAKE THE STAGE LOOK LIKE A 
GIANT TELEVISION SCREEN)
.ch ro  
(MODESTLY)  
Well, an effort like this requires the work of several talented people; 
I just happened to be the one whose name got on the credits first.  
.ch st  
In large pink letters that flashed. 
.ch ro  
Wait a minute here, campers.
Are you accusing me of being an egotist?  Me, Lucas Spielberg, the  

greatest television producer in all the known worlds?   
Nonsense!   
Fortunately, I am above such slights.   
.ad 
(HE SNIFFS.  TECHIES ARE DONE BY NOW)   
.ch pa  
With Your Honour's permission, I would like to show a portion of the
taped broadcast of the game on this 536 inch living colour TV.  
(TO SPIELBERG)  
Can we take it from the beginning of the rain delay?
.ch ro  
Hey, I can dig it.
