.ch hj  
I had been called from my vigilant patrol of local donut shops  
to a homicide in Inquisition Stadium.   
Inquisition Stadium...Hell's biggest baseball park, a diamond   
in the rough.   
The sort of place where men carry bats and throw things at each 
other; the sort of place where women carry pom-poms and jump up 
with their legs wide apart; 
.ul 
my  
sort of place.

Objection, Your Honour!

The witness is glamourizing himself!
.ch wj  
I'm a homicide detective, Your Honour.  
I deal in mutilated corpses, human corruption, and sordid crimes of 
passion.
The job

glamourous, I can't help that.

So. 
Somebody call for a homicide detective?

Joe Bob Hatfield-McCoy, a simple county coroner.

My name is Yogourt. 
Jim Yogourt.
I'm a cop.  
My beat is Hell.
.ch mc  
What I figure we got here...
.ch hj  
Get real, McCoy.
You're a doctor, not a detective.   
You're scarcely a trained professional when it comes to murder. 
.ch mc  
I'm the coroner!
Death is my life.   
.ch hj  
(CHUCKLING INDULGENTLY) 
Of course it is.
Now, stay out of my way and let me do my investigating. 
(POINTING AT SATAN) 
Make yourself useful and get that drunk out of here.
.ch mc  
That drunk happens to be our Lord and Master, the Father of Lies,   
the Destroyer of Innocence, and the ultimate architect behind   
the Davis Centre.   
.ch hj  
(PRODS SATAN WITH TOE)  
Seems pretty sedate for a fallen angel. 
.ch mc  
Now Jim, this is

my  
field of expertise. 
Allow me to make a scientific and unbiased assessment of
Old Nick's present condition and spare me your well-intended, but   
.ul 
amateur 
observations.   
.ad 
(MCCOY DOES SOMETHING TO SATAN'S BODY THAT NO LIVING BEING COULD SURVIVE.)  
.ex 
In my highly qualified opinion, what we have here is your basic 
pushing-up-the-daisies, soon-to-be-interred, rapidly putrifying corpse. 
.ch hj  
Could you put that in layman's terms?   
.ch mc  
He's dead, Jim. 
.ch hj  
(CHUCKLING INDULGENTLY) 
So, you fell for that old ruse, did you?
This is the Father of Lies, McCoy!  
It would be just like him to fake his own death.

Come on, you.   
We're onto your little game.
Why don't you save us a lot of trouble and stop pretending you're dead.

Good work if you can get it...not much of room for

.ch hj  
Been here long? 
.ch hh  
Well, I guess it was about sixty years ago that I told the Big Guy  
upstairs that I'd be damned if he could find a knot that could  
hold Harry Houdini. 
In retrospect, I'd have to say it wasn't the best choice of words.  
.ch hj  
So, can you shed any light on the murder?   
.ch hh  
I did.  
.ch hj  
See anything?   
.ch hh  
The inside of the blindfold.
.ch hj  
Oh. 
Right.  
So you don't know anything about the murder?
.ch hh  
Not much, aside from the fact that the murderer was female, 
about 5'5", weight about 110, right-handed, wore heels, 
killed Satan with his own trident, and uses a diaphragm.
(PAUSE) 
I have good ears.   
.ch hj  
You could tell all that just by listening?

Everything but the diaphragm.

I'm naming you as a material witness.   
Hang loose but don't leave town.

It was all coming together. 
All I needed was one more break.
Suddenly, there was a knock at the door.

Friend, have you been saved?

No.

.ex 
In this business, you learn to distrust synchronicity.  
.ch dh  
Umm, excuse me for interrupting your aside, man, but I was  
wondering if maybe you could be like brutal to me now rather
than later. 
I have a pressing need to conclude a financial transaction  
with an excitable individual in the pharmaceutical supply business, 
and it would not be healthy to keep him waiting.
.ch hj  
And just what were you doing here at the stadium?   
.ch dh  
Well, I happened to be reclining in the nearby parking lot, 
and I witnessed a large crowd entering this arena in a state of 
high anticipation.  
I thought it must be a rock show...and since this is a rock 
and roll hell, I thought they must have a heavenly band.
I entered during a moment of inattention by one of the gatekeepers, 
but discovered to my distaste, that the event transpiring was simply
a ball game.
Pity, I say to myself.  
But then I think, these are athletes.   
And athletes carry with them abusable substances.   
So I went in search of same and found myself here.  
.ch hj  
Did you see anything?   
.ch dh  
Well, I saw that red-haired woman over there wandering in consternation,
muttering something about showing Satan where he could put his stupid trident.  
I followed her, thinking that perhaps there might be
an interesting scene.   
.ch wj  
Another dead end.   
It looked like I would never solve this case.   
Then I saw her face.
I looked through the crowd and there was the most beautiful 
woman I had ever seen.  
I could sense that she was innocent, vulnerable, built. 
She needed my help. 
She needed it badly.
I casually made my way over to her.

It called for some of the old Yogourt tact.

I was his...executive assistant.
I found the body.    we 

He was just lying there.
Like you see now.   
Only without the spittoon, shave and the root canal.
.ch wj  
She was too pure, too innocent to have worked willingly 
for Satan.  
I comforted her.

Here, have a seat.

No, no, just ask me your questions. 
I can (SNIFF) bear it.  
.ch hj  
Did you see Satan buy it?   
.ch ab  
Buy it? 
Oh, you mean did I see him get killed?  
I'm sorry, these sophisticated police terms confuse me.

You're covering something up, aren't you?   
.ch ab  
It was probably nothing.
This red-haired woman followed him out; they were having
an argument, and when he left, she went after him.  
She wasn't finished getting her point across.   
.ch hj  
What were they arguing about?   
.ch ab  
She wanted to be released from Hell.
She didn't like how she was being treated.  
His Unholy Lordship refused to listen.  
He said that she would have to wait until her eternal   
punishment was finished, just like everyone else.   
.ch wj  
There was something bothering me.   
Almost as if the solution was just outside my grasp.
.ch mc  
Jim, can I have a word with you?
.ch hj  
What is it? 
Can't you see I'm dealing with a distraught woman here?

There was a woman with red hair who was seen arguing with Satan 
and in possession of the weapon, right?

Have you been listening to my private interrogations?   ailb
