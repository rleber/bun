MALAPROP ENTERS AND SITS.)  
.ch ma  
Session is resume'd.
Now where were we?  
.ch ba  
In the courtroom.   
.ch ho  
I was about to begin my cross-examination, your Honour. 
.ch ma  
Very well; proceed. 
.ch ho  
Now Mr. Slobotnik, you were present at the  
scene of the crime, were you not?   
.ch ja  
Yeah, I even saw it happen. 
.ch ho  
(CONTINUES WITHOUT HEARING JAKE)
And you had access, at the time, to a large bat-like weapon,
did you not?
.ch ja  
(CONTINUES WITHOUT HEARING HOPE)
Yeah, she walked right up to him and stuck it to him.   
.ch ho  
And you despised Satan for tricking you into this situation,
is that not correct?
.ch ja  
Yeah, the blood was spurting all over the place, but I noticed  
she was careful to avoid it.
.ch ho  

So you have motive, opportunity, and means, just like my client,
did you not?
.ch ja  
Jesus Christ!   
Haven't you been listening to a word I said?
I just told you that I saw the murder.  
.ch ho  
Mr. Slobotnik, I'm supposed to be asking the questions here.
.ch ja  
Then get off your rusty duff and ask some intelligent ones, 
you moron.  
I was present at the scene of the crime...  
.ch ho  
Yes but--   
.ch ja  
I saw the whole thing...
.ch ho  
Yes, but what-- 
.ch ja  
What does that mean to you? 
.ch ho  
I don't know.   
.ch ja  
You jackass, why don't you ask me what I saw?   
.ch ho  
Objection, witness is harassing the counsel.
.ch ma  
And about time somebody did.
Overruled!  
.ch ho  
Oh, very well.  
Mr. Slobotnik, can we get back to the question at hand? 
.ch ja  
Sure, why not?  
Let's waste a few more hours.   
.ch ho  
Did Satan trick you into being here?
.ch ja  
Well, it was more that he offered me the thrill of a lifetime.  
.ch ho  
And what was this thrill of a lifetime? 
.ch ja  
Well, it was after the game against Jackson's team...
