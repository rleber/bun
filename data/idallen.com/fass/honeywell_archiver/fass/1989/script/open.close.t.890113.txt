A blazing place to flee the might   
Of winter's ice and snow.   
     A comic respite
     From mid-terms tonight 
Another Damned FASS Show!   
.ve 5   
All ye who watch, abandon hope  
Condemned to undergo
     The same old folks 
     The same tired jokes   
Another Damned FASS Show!

     Sing slow, and tarry a bit 
     Charon's gonna ferry me home   
     Judas Iscariot's   
     Gonna be my chaperone

          Lights up, Kerry, lights up!  
          Bring the house to half and   
          Then they'll start to laugh!  
          It's FASS eighty-nine, eighty-nine!   
.sb "TO HELL AND BACK, JUST FOR YOU" "PUT A LITTLE LOVE IN YOUR HEART"  
That's it for '89   
Had a hell of a time
Giving the devil his due!   
Joking at hell's expense
To thrill our audience  
To Hell and back just for you!

     Life is swell  
     At U. of Waterloo  
     Life is hell   

     At U. of Waterloo  
     We want
     To be  
     At U.  
     Of T.! 
.ve 6   
Confronted omniscience  
With damned impertinence
Speak of the devil...we do! 
Then in our quest for grins,
Tried all the deadly sins   
To Hell and back just for you!  
.ve 8   
     Life is grand  
     At U. of Waterloo  
     Life is bland  
     At U. of Waterloo  
     We could   
     Have been  
     At Brock   
     Or Queen's!

(Good)bye to rehearsal noise
Adieu to Satan's choice 
That's it for learning our lines
Aloha to dev'lish jokes 
Auf wiedersehn, dear folks  
Au revoir FASS '89. 
.ve 8   
     Guess we're stuck  
     At U. of Waterloo  
     Out of luck
     At U. of Waterloo  
     But we 
     Won't cry. 
     It's not   
     De Vrie!
