Which one did you get?  
.ch li  
The lease!

All signed? 
Look at your lease, and then look at this one.  
If you'll look carefully, you'll see that you, Lisa,
are the one who is renting. 
In technical terms, the lessee. 
.ch li  
According to this, Mrs. Eliza is the one who's leasing, or the lessor.  
.ch sa  
Correct.
So Lisa is the lessee and Eliza is the lessor.  
.ch li  
So what?
You lost.   
.ch sa  
You see, my company, Lucifer Unlimited, 
owns the private corporation which owns Mrs. Eliza. 
This lease means that Lucifer has Eliza on a leash. 
.ch li  
You own her?
.ch sa  
It's simple, dear.  
Though you, Lisa, are the lessee and Eliza is the lessor,   
in the other leasing Lucifer leases to Eliza,   
Eliza is the lesser of the lessors, 
and so you, Lisa, are the lesser on two levels. 
Now check the address on that condo.
.ch li  
Oh, Hell.   
.ch sa  
Exactly.
I always win.
