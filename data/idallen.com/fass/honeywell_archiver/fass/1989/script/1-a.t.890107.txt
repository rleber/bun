Ladies and gentlemen of the Jury:   
look at the face of the defendant.

Those are perfectly formed...of course, I don't see what relevance that has.
.ch li  
Let me start again. 
Your Honour, we will show that the accused had motive, weapon, and  
opportunity to commit this heinous crime.   
We will show beyond a shadow of a doubt that the accused, this so-called
innocent soul, was present at the scene of the crime, and   
wielded the weapon against our beloved leader, for some twisted,
demented, crazed reason.
We will show you why no jury on earth could possibly forgive the
horrendous crime that has been committed.

Idiot, we're not on earth!
