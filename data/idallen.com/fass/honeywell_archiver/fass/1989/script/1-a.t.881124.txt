.ad

.ch li  
Ladies and gentlemen of the Jury.   
Look at the accused.
Is this not the flaming red hair of a deranged mind?
Are these not the emerald green eyes of a cold-blooded executioner? 
Are these not the ruby lips of a raving lunatic?
Are these not the full and firm breasts of...   
.ch ho  
Objection.  
Deformation of character!

Overruled.  
Those are perfectly formed...of course, I don't see what relevance that has.
.ch st  
Your Honour, we will show that the accused had motive, weapon, and  
opportunity to commit this heinous crime.   
We will show beyond a shadow of a doubt that the accused, this so   
claimed innocent soul, was present at the scene of the crime, and   
wielded the weapon against our beloved leader, for some twisted,
demented, crazed reason.
We WILL show you why no jury on earth could ever possibly forgive the   
horrendous crime that has been committed.   
.ch li  
Idiot, we're not on earth!

.ch ma  
Very well, strike that last bit from the record.
