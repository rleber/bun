Overruled.  
I have no objection to being entertained...especially by them.

.ch li  
No further questions, your honour.  
This man has proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that the accused was present   
at the scene of the crime with the murder weapon in her hands.  
.ch wj  
What...oh yeah. 
.ch li  
The defence may wish to cross-examine,  
but with an unimpeachable, informed,
and impartial witness such as Mr Yogourt,   
any cross-examination would clearly be futile.
