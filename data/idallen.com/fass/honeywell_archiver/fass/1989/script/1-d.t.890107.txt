THE JUDGE IS NOW PLAYING WITH AN EXECUTIVE TOY. 
HE IS NOT LISTENING.
THERE ARE, OF COURSE, STILL MORE TOYS ON HIS BENCH) 
.prip "EXECUTIVE TOY THAT DEMONSTRATES NEWTON'S THING"  
.prip "STILL MORE TOYS FOR JUDGE"   
.ch st  
Our witness has clearly shown that Ms. Griement was 
associating with a subversive group and furthermore, she
cruelly toyed with our Master's affections. 
.ch jm  
Toys?   
Toys?   
.ch pa  
Just a figure of speech, sir.   
.ch ho  
Are we to take the word of a self-confessed clandestine operative?  
.ch st  
Yes.
.ch ho  
Oh. 
Just checking.  
.ch lg  
How many lawyers does it take to change a light bulb?   
(BEAT) Three.   
.ch pa  
One to represent the bulb, one to represent the socket, and...  
.ch lg  
One to screw everyone involved. 
.ch na  
(TO JUDGE)  
So, darlink, what   
.ul 
do  
you wear under that robe?   
.ch jm  
A kilt. 
(BEAT)  
What do you wear under that veil?   
.ad 
(NATASHA RAISES HER VEIL)   
.ex 
I've always liked a woman with prominent cheek bones.   
.ch na  
But remember, darlink, I'm not just a pretty face.  
.ch pa  
Remember the prima facie reason we're here -- bail? 
.ch jm  
Very well, bail is defied.  
.ch ho  
But your Honour, don't I get a chance-- 
.ch jm  
No! 
Now sit down and be quiet or I'll have the bailiff reject you.  
Ms. Badenov, you may step down. 
Mr. Prosecutor, call your next witness. 
.ad 
(LIBERTY BEGINS MADLY RIFLING THROUGH ALL PAPERS ON HIS DESK.   
NATASHA LEAVES THE WITNESS BOX.)
.ch st  
Oh, no. 
Don't tell me you've lost your notes.   
.ch li  
They're not so much "lost" as "spatially ambiguous".
.ch st  
Just like a man to drop his briefs. 
.ch li  
What do you mean, "just like a man"?
.ch st  
Oh. 
The testosterone's kicking in now.  
.ch li  
PMS is an ugly thing in a lawyer.   .ch .ch 

.ch st  
But it's a valid defense for murder.
.ch li  
I can question this witness without any notes.  
The prosecution calls...
.ad 
(PAUSE) 
.ch st

EVERYONE BRACES THEMSELVES) 
.prip "BULLHORN"
.ch ba  
(QUIETLY)  Jake Slobotnik to the stand. 
(TO OTHERS)  Fooled you, didn't I?  
.ad 
(JAKE ENTERS AND TAKES THE STAND.)  
.ex 
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? 
.ch ja  
No.  A gentleman never swears.  
.ch ba  
Do you politely agree to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but   
the truth?  
.ch ja  
Yes.
.ch li  
Mr. Slobotnik, you have information vital to this tragic
case, do you not?   
.ch ja  
No. 
.ad 
(KAY LOOKS SMUG)
.ch li  
Well then, you have news of the hideous conspiracy that took
the very breath of life of the Lord and Master of Toxic Waste Dumps.
.ch ja  
No. 
.ad 
(KAY LOOKS SMUGGER) 
.ch li  
Then you have secret data pertaining to the despicable and  

corrupt nature of the accused and can tell the court why she
committed this accursed, contemptible, despicable, erinaceous,  
sordid, loathesome, wretched... er, wretched... 
.ch st  
Crime.  
.ch li  
Crime!  
.ch ja  
No. 
But I do know how they get the caramel in the Caramilk bar. 
.ch jm  
Really? 
.ch li  
Oh, hell, Kay, you take over.   
.ch st  
Thank you.  
A masterful job of questioning. 
Nice going, stud.   
.ch li  
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch.  
.ch st  
(TO JAKE)   
Why 
.ul 
are 
you here, Mr. Slobotnik?
.ch ja  
To tell how the baseball game got started.  
.ch st  
And how did the baseball game get started?  
.ch ja  
Satan made a deal with Ms. Griement where he would let her and her friends  
go free, if her team could beat his in a baseball game. 
.ch li  
And she agreed? 
.ch ja  
Yes, and Satan even made sure that she was represented by the most  
famous baseball team in the world.
