.sb "Baseball On His Mind" "Gentle On My Mind"  
.ve 10  
It's knowing that the slightest hint of romance makes   
this baseball player balk,  
That makes me wish that I could find the strength to say
"I'm out of here" and walk. 
For though he's pitcher perfect,
And at ball games he's a winner,
To romance, love, and passion he is blind.  
Which means that I'm the loser. 
So, I guess I'll hit the showers,   
'Cause he's got only baseball on his mind.  
.ve 10  
One evening, I was planning a seduction,
so I asked him to my place. 
I should have known I'd never even have a chance
To make it to first base.   
I lit a dozen candles   
and slipped off to the bedroom, 
And came back nearly naked just to find,
Him sitting at the TV,  
watching reruns of the Blue Jays,   
'Cause he's got only baseball on his mind.  
.ad 
(JAKE ENTERS.)  
.ch mo  
Hey, Jake!  
How come you let dat slug, Jackson, steal second?   
.ch ja  
Because you threw a slow inside curve, go-nad.  
.ch mo  
But you asked for...
Wait a minute.  
Is it one finger, fastball, two fingers, curve, or  
the other way around?   
.ch ja  
(PATIENTLY) 
The finger that is single means the thrower must be slower. 
The digit that is double means the cast that is fast.   
.ch mo  
The digit that is single means the thrower must be fast.
No.
