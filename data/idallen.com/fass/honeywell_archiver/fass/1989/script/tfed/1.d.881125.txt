111-SSSTTTOOONNNEEE(111):   So,  you  are telling us that Ms. Griement was
   plotting to overthrow  Satan  and  destroy  his  Kingdom,






   despite his having given her a 9000 sq ft condo with full
   recreational facilities. 


222-NNNAAATTTAAASSSHHHAAA(111):  Yes, darlink.


3-STONE(2):  Your worship, we the prosecution put it to  you
   that  these are not the actions of a trustworthy citizen.
   I would not trust this person, my partner would not trust
   this person, and the worthy visitors to our court (POINTS
   TO AUDIENCE) would not trust this person.


(AT THIS POINT, ROSE BUSH STANDS.  SHE HAS BEEN  SITTING  IN
THE AUDIENCE, DISGUISED AS A BUSH.) 


444-RRROOOSSSEEE BBBUUUSSSHHH(111):   I  don't  trust that woman.  No one really
   has hair that colour.


555-HHHOOOPPPEEE(111):  Objection!   That  woman's  obviously  a  plant.
   (STARTS TO RIFLE THROUGH HIS NOTES)  


6-STONE(3):   The facts in this case clearly show that Satan
   helped and favoured this person,  and  she  attempted  to
   betray him.  Even my worthy colleague opposite must agree
   that these are not  the  actions  of  a  trustworthy  in-
   dividual.  Right?


7-HOPE(2):  (LOOKING UP FROM NOTES) Right!...Well er... nor-
   mally right...but in this case...



8-STONE(4):  There you have it, your Honour, do you need  to
   hear more?   


999-JJJUUUDDDGGGEEE MMMAAALLLAAAPPPRRROOOPPP(111):  Very well, bail is denied.

10-HOPE(3):  But your Honour, don't I get a chance--


11-MALAPROP(2):  No!  Now sit down and be quiet or I'll have
   the bailiff reject you.  Ms. Badanov, you may step down. 


111222-LLLIIISSSAAA GGGRRRIIIEEEMMMEEENNNTTT(111):  Why is this taking so long?   


13-HOPE(4):  The duty of a judge is to  administer  justice,
   but his practice is to delay it. 


14-LISA(2):  Well can't he delay any faster?


15-HOPE(5):   Time  is  precious, but truth is more precious
   than time.   


16-LISA(3):  So far we haven't seen any truth.  


17-HOPE(6):  Law is a strange thing.  It makes a  man  swear
   to  tell the  truth, and every time he shows some sign of
   doing so, some lawyer objects.   















18-LISA(4):  Enough with the epigrams.  Do your job or  I'll
   do a job on you! 


111999-RRREEEPPPOOORRRTTTEEERRR(111):  If you give us an exclusive... 


20-LISA(5):  Listen greaseball, why should I trust you? 


21-REPORTER(2):  Hey lady, I'm a reputable member of the En-
   quirer staff, and I even stole  the  prosecution's  notes
   for you. 


(LISA  GRABS FOR THE NOTES.  REPORTER HOLDS NOTES OUT OF HER
REACH AS THEY DANCE AROUND.)


222222-LLLIIIBBBEEERRRTTTYYY(111):  Hey!   He's  got  my  notes!  (CHASES  AFTER
   REPORTER)


23-MALAPROP(3):  Bailiff, size that man!


222444-BBBAAAIIILLLIIIFFFFFF(111):  16 collar, 42 sleeve... 


(GENERAL  CONFUSION  AS  PROSECUTION  TRIES  TO  CORNER  THE
REPORTER AND OTHERS JOIN IN THE CHASE.) 


25-MALAPROP(4):  Order!  Order in the court!


26-REPORTER(3):  Ham and Cheese on Rye, please. 


27-MALAPROP(5):  Bailiff, inject that man!  


(BAILIFF PRODUCES A _H_U_G_E NEEDLE AND CHASES THE REPORTER  OUT
OF THE COURTROOM.  ALL QUIET NOW.)

   Now  where  were  we...   Ah  yes,  about  to start in on
   another witness. 


28-LIBERTY(2):  But your Honour...my notes...   


(MALAPROP GLARES  AT  HIM.   LIBERTY  BEGINS  MADLY  RIFLING
THROUGH ALL PAPERS ON HIS DESK) 


   Prosecution calls... 


29-STONE(5):  Jake Slobotnik.   


30-LIBERTY(3):  Jake Slobotnik to the stand.


(JAKE ENTERS AND TAKES THE STAND.)  


31-LIBERTY(4):  Mr. Slobotnik, you have information vital to
   this tragic case, do you not?


333222-JJJAAAKKKEEE SSSLLLOOOBBBOOOTTTNNNIIIKKK(111):  No.  


33-LIBERTY(5):  Well then, you have news of the hideous con-
   spiracy that took the very breath of life of the Lord and
   Master of Toxic Waste Dumps. 


34-JAKE(2):  No.


35-LIBERTY(6):  Then you have secret data pertaining to  the
   despicable and corrupt nature of the accused and can tell
   the court why she committed this accursed, beastly,  con-
   temptible,  despicable,  erinaceous,  frightful, heinous,

   ignominious,  loathsome,  monstrous,  nasty,  outrageous,
   sordid, terrible, vile, wretched... er, wretched...  


36-STONE(6):  Crime.


37-LIBERTY(7):  Crime!  


38-JAKE(3):   No.  But I do know how they get the caramel in
   the Caramilk bar.


39-MALAPROP(6):  Really!  How do they do that?  I've  always
   wondered.


40-LIBERTY(8):  Why are you here?   


41-JAKE(4):  To tell how the baseball game got started. 


42-LIBERTY(9):  Oh.  How did the baseball game get started? 


43-JAKE(5):   Satan  made  a deal with Ms. Griement where he
   would let her go free, if her team could beat  his  in  a
   baseball game.

44-LIBERTY(10):  And she agreed.


45-JAKE(6):   Yes.   Satan  even insisted on getting her the
   world's most famous team on her side.
