THE HEARING IMPAIRED.  NOTE THAT THE  TRANSLATOR'S  SIGNINGS
SHOULD   BE   TIMED   AS  IF  THE  TRANSLATOR  WAS  ACTUALLY
TRANSLATING WHAT IS BEING SAID) 


111-BBBUUUCCCKKK(111):   Welcome  back,  sports  fans,  to  the   Sports
   Network.  I'm Buck.  


222-TTTRRRAAANNNSSSLLLAAATTTOOORRR(111):   (SIGNING)  Welcome  back, sports fans, to
   the Sports Network.  I'm Buck.   


333-FFFEEERRRGGGIIIEEE(111):  And I'm Fergie.   


4-TRANSLATOR(2):  (SIGNING) And I'm Fergie. 











5-FERGIE(2):  (READING FROM SCRIPT) The sky  is  black,  the
   rain is pouring, and it's a beautiful day for baseball...


6-TRANSLATOR(3):  (SIGNING, AND LOOKING A LITTLE STARTLED AS
   THIS IS  TRANSLATED)  The  sky  is  black,  the  rain  is
   pouring, and it's a beautiful day for baseball...


7-BUCK(2):  (POINTING OUT THE WINDOW) It's not raining. 


8-FERGIE(3):  Shhh.

9-TRANSLATOR(4):  (SIGNING) Shhh.   


10-FERGIE(4):   (RESUMING) The temperature is near-freezing,
   with a gale-force wind blowing from the north-west...


(TRANSLATOR SHOULD NOW POSITION SELF SLIGHTLY BEHIND  FERGIE
AND  BUCK  AS  THE  PRECEDING  LINE  IS TRANSLATED INTO SIGN
LANGUAGE.  THIS LEAVES TRANSLATOR  IN  PERFECT  POSITION  TO
MAKE  FACES AT FERGIE AND BUCK AS THE FOLLOWING TRANSLATIONS
ARE BEING PERFORMED.)   


11-TRANSLATOR(5):  (SIGNING) Fergie is a  blithering  idiot,
   and  only  those  of us who know sign language can under-
   stand this speech.   









12-BUCK(3):  (POINTING OUT THE WINDOW) It's not raining.


13-FERGIE(5):  Just a minute.  I'm almost done. 


14-TRANSLATOR(6):  (SIGNING) Wait!  


15-FERGIE(6):  (RESUMING READING FROM THE SCRIPT)  And  yet,
   for  some  reason,  the  teams have not reappeared on the
   field.  Buck, I don't understand.


16-TRANSLATOR(7):  (SIGNING) Isn't it neat that we  can  say
   things that most of the audience can't hear? 


17-BUCK(4):  Fergie, it's not raining.  We're in hell.  They
   can't play baseball until it starts raining again.   


18-TRANSLATOR(8):  (SIGNING) God, this  dialogue  is  awful.
   Who wrote this crap anyway?  


19-FERGIE(7):  Oh.  


20-TRANSLATOR(9):  (EXAGGERATED SIGNING) Oh.


21-BUCK(5):  How long, O Lord, how long?


222222-GGGOOODDD(111):  (OFFSTAGE) Until she gets it right! 


(FERGIE STARTS TO CRY)  


23-BUCK(6):  Mother told me there would be day like this.   


24-TRANSLATOR(10):  (SIGNING) How many sign language experts
   does it take to change a light bulb? 


25-BUCK(7):  There, there, don't cry.   

















26-TRANSLATOR(11):  (SIGNING) One, as  long  as  he  doesn't
   talk!  Ha! Ha! Ha!

27-BUCK(8):  (HANDING FERGIE A HANDKERCHIEF) Here.  Fix your
   face.  Now repeat after me.  


28-FERGIE(8):  After me.


29-BUCK(9):  In the beginning of this big inning, Bell's the
   batter  and  he's  bitter  about his bunting because Bean
   Ball Bailey's the better bunter but  with  Brinkley  Bass
   and  Boss  Bull on base, Bell can't bet on anything but a
   bunt.


(TRANSLATOR GLARES THEN HOLDS UP SIGN WHICH  SAYS  'I  quit'
AND EXITS.  FERGIE BURSTS INTO TEARS.)  


30-BUCK(10):  Take a deep breath.   


(FERGIE TAKES AN EXAGGERATED DEEP BREATH)   


   Come with me over to the window. 


(BUCK AND FERGIE MOVE TO ONE SIDE OF THE STAGE BUCK REALIZES
THAT FERGIE IS STILL HOLDING BREATH AND SLAMS FERGIE IN  THE
DIAPHRAGM.) 


   Look outside.  What do you see?  


31-FERGIE(9):  I see Billy, and Betty, and Susie... 


32-BUCK(11):  Not that window.  



(BUCK TURNS FERGIE TO FACE A DIFFERENT WINDOW.) 


33-FERGIE(10):   I  see...  steam  rising from the outfield.
   It's kind of romantic, in its own way.   


34-BUCK(12):  I'm sure it is, Fergie.  Now, tell those  good
   people  in  television land what's happening in the ball-
   game.


35-FERGIE(11):  Umm... it's the top of  the  seventh  inning
   with  two  men  on,  two  men  out  and  one  finally ex-
   tinguished.  


36-BUCK(13):  There.  That wasn't so bad, was it?   


37-FERGIE(12):  No.  Thanks, Buck.  You're so good to me.   


(FERGIE SMILES  UP  AT  BUCK  SWEETLY;  BUCK  ELBOWS  FERGIE
SOMEPLACE SENSITIVE)


38-BUCK(14):  Let's take time out for these brief commercial
   messages.

39-FERGIE(13):  That hurt!  


40-BUCK(15):  Good! 


41-FERGIE(14):  But it was good pain, Buck. 


42-BUCK(16):  Shut up.  














(ENTER  A NERVOUS YUPPIE (OR WHITNEY HOUSTON LOOKALIKE).  HE
GETS OUT A PIECE OF WAX PAPER AND PUTS IT ON  THE  FLOOR  OR
OTHER SURFACE.  THEN HE GETS OUT A ZIPLOC BAGGIE FILLED WITH
AN ILLICIT WHITE POWDER.  GINGERLY, HE  POURS  A  LARGE  BUT
MEASURED  AMOUNT  OF  SAME  ONTO  THE  WAX  PAPER.  THEN, HE
PRODUCES (FROM SOMEWHERE) A LARGE JAR LABELLED  "LOW-CALORIE
SWEETENER" (OR "ASPARTAME" OR "NUTRA-SWEET").  HE MIXES THIS
IN WITH THE WHITE POWDER.  THEN, HE TAKES A GENEROUS  SNORT,
AFTER  WHICH  HE  LOOKS  UP AT THE AUDIENCE, NOSE COVERED IN
WHITE POWDER, AND SAYS:)

(LIGHTS  ON  A FOXHOLE.  TWO MEN ARE IN IT.  A CANADIAN FLAG
WITH BULLET HOLES IN IT IS BESIDE THE FOXHOLE.) 


444444-MMMAAANNN 111(111):  George?   


444555-MMMAAANNN 222(111):  Yeah? 


46-MAN 1(2):  I think the coast is clear.  Take a look. 


47-MAN 2(2):  No way, buddy.  You're not getting me to  look
   this time.   






48-MAN 1(3):  It's your turn, George.   


49-MAN 2(3):  Shit. 


(SLOWLY,  MAN 2 STICKS HIS HEAD OUT OF THE FOXHOLE.  WHEN HE
DOES, THERE ARE LOUD CRIES FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE STAGE)


[S-1] (GUNFIRE, FIRST FROM ONE SIDE OF THE  STAGE  THEN  THE S  
OTHER, THEN SILENCE)


   God, I hate being part of a peacekeeping force.  


555000-VVVOOOIIICCCEEEOOOVVVEEERRR(111):   The  Canadian  Armed Forces -- there's no
   life like it.

51-BUCK(17):  Hello yet again, sports fans.   The  field  is
   being  drenched  by  a  torrential downpour, so play will
   soon be resumed.

52-FERGIE(15):   (CHILDISHLY)  Buck,  I  know  something you
   don't know.  


53-BUCK(18):  Fergie, would you knock it off?   


54-FERGIE(16):  Promise not to tell anyone? 


55-BUCK(19):  Fergie, stop acting like a child. 


56-FERGIE(17):  It's about Magnum P.I.  


57-BUCK(20):  I don't care. 



58-FERGIE(18):  Higgins really is Robin Masters!


59-BUCK(21):  I'm not listening...  


(BUCK PUTS HIS HANDS OVER HIS EARS  AND  BEGINS  HUMMING  TO
HIMSELF)


60-FERGIE(19):  Buck, that's not nice.  


(BUCK CONTINUES HUMMING)


   You're being mean.   


(MORE HUMMING)  


   Right.  I'm leaving. 


(HUMMING.  FERGIE STARTS TO WALK OFFSTAGE)  


   I'm going now.  Bye. 


61-BUCK(22):  (RESIGNEDLY, IN A MONOTONE) No, Fergie.  Don't
   leave me.  I can't do this job by myself.


62-FERGIE(20):  Say please. 


63-BUCK(23):  Pretty please with maple sugar on it. 


64-FERGIE(21):  Oh... all right.


65-BUCK(24):   Now,  blow  your  nose  while  I  read   this
   promotional announcement.  (HANDS FERGIE A HANDKERCHIEF) 


66-FERGIE(22):  Okay.   


67-BUCK(25):   Remember,  fans,  next  Tuesday  is Penthouse
   Split-Crotch Panty Day at the ballpark!  All fans 14  and
   under will receive a free intimate undergarment...

ACTORS TALKING IN HIGHSPEED GIBBERISH THROUGHOUT.  BUCK  AND
FERGIE TALK FOR A BIT, THEN WE SEE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE GAME SO
FAR:)

FLY BALL)   


(2  -- A MAN SQUARES TO BUNT, AND GETS HIT IN THE GROIN WITH
THE PITCH)  


(3 -- THE OUTFIELDERS AND INFIELDER GO FOR A BALL AGAIN, AND

(4  -- A PLAYER CAUGHT STEALING, FOLLOWED BY AN UNBELIEVABLY
EXAGGERATED ARGUMENT BETWEEN AN UMPIRE AND A MANAGER)   


(5 -- THE OUTFIELDERS AND INFIELDER GO FOR ANOTHER BALL, AND
GET HIT BY EITHER A DROPPING SEAGULL OR SEAGULL DROPPINGS)

BUCKET  OF  WATER  IS  ABOUT  TO  HIT   THE   PERSON   BEING
EXTINGUISHED, THE FOLLOWING HAPPENS:)

HEAD)

777111-NNNOOOAAAHHH HHHOOOPPPEEE(111):  (AS CLARENCE DARROW IN 'INHERIT THE WIND',
   THE  SPENCER TRACY VERSION) Your honour, learned council,
   ladies and gentlemen of the jury:  I think what I have to
   say  was  best said by another man.  A wise man.  A man I
   think we've all heard of.  The quality of  mercy  is  not
   strained, it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven...  


72-LIBERTY(2):  If we run the tape, will you shut up?   


73-HOPE(2):  Yes.   


74-LIBERTY(3):  Objection withdrawn.


75-FERGIE(23):  ...making the third out.

A TRIDENT, STAGE LEFT)

77-ROBIN(2):  Certainly.
