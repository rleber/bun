   we?  


















222-BBBAAAIIILLLIIIFFFFFF(111):  In the courtroom.


333-NNNOOOAAAHHH HHHOOOPPPEEE(111):   I was about to begin my cross-examination,
   your Honour. 


4-MALAPROP(2):  Very well; proceed. 


5-HOPE(2):  Now Mr. Slobotnik, you were present at the scene
   of the crime, were you not?  


666-JJJAAAKKKEEE SSSLLLOOOBBBOOOTTTNNNIIIKKK(111):  Yeah, I even saw it happen.   


7-HOPE(3):  (CONTINUES WITHOUT HEARING JAKE) And you had ac-
   cess, at the time, to a large bat-like  weapon,  did  you
   not? 


8-JAKE(2):   (CONTINUES  WITHOUT  HEARING  HOPE)  Yeah,  she
   walked right up to him and stuck it to him.  


9-HOPE(4):  And you despised Satan  for  tricking  you  into
   this situation, is that not correct? 


10-JAKE(3):   Yeah,  the  blood  was  spurting  all over the
   place, but I noticed she was careful to avoid it.


11-HOPE(5):  So you have  motive,  opportunity,  and  means,
   just like my client, did you not?


12-JAKE(4):   Jesus Christ!  Haven't you been listening to a
   word I said?  I just told you that I saw the murder. 








13-HOPE(6):  Mr. Slobotnik, I'm supposed to  be  asking  the
   questions here.

14-JAKE(5):   Then  get off your rusty duff and ask some in-
   telligent ones, you moron.  I was present at the scene of
   the crime... 


15-HOPE(7):  Yes but--  


16-JAKE(6):  I saw the whole thing...   


17-HOPE(8):  Yes, but what--


18-JAKE(7):  What does that mean to you?


19-HOPE(9):  I don't know.  


20-JAKE(8):  You jackass, why don't you ask me what I saw?  


21-HOPE(10):  Objection, witness is harassing the counsel.  


22-MALAPROP(3):  And about time somebody did.  Overruled!   


23-HOPE(11):  Oh, very well.  Mr. Slobotnik, can we get back
   to the question at hand? 


24-JAKE(9):  Sure, why not?  Let's waste a few more hours.  


25-HOPE(12):  Did Satan trick you into being here?  


26-JAKE(10):  Well, it was  more  that  he  offered  me  the
   thrill of a lifetime.


27-HOPE(13):  And what was this thrill of a lifetime?   



28-JAKE(11):   Well, it was after the game against Jackson's
   team...
