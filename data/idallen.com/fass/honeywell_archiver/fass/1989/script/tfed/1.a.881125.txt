1:a                       OPENING                     Page 2


   State your name and address for the record.

12-MALAPROP(5):   You  are  charged  with  the  premedicated
   murder of Satan, Lord and Master  of  all.   How  do  you
   plead?   


13-LISA(2):  On my knees, your Honour.  


14-MALAPROP(6):  No!  How do you apply to the charges?  


15-LISA(3):  Uhh...I'm the defendant, your Honour.  


16-MALAPROP(7):  Are you guilty or what?


17-LISA(4):  Oh, not guilty, your Honour.   


18-MALAPROP(8):   The  court  will  now spear opening state-
   ments.   


(BAILIFF TAKES OUT A SPEAR  AND  PIERCES  THE  PROSECUTION'S
PAPERS.)
















19-LIBERTY(3):   Ladies  and gentlemen of the Jury.  Look at
   the accused.  Is this not  the  flaming  red  hair  of  a
   deranged mind?  Are these not the emerald green eyes of a
   cold-blooded executioner?  Are these not the ruby lips of
   a  raving  lunatic?   Are  these  not  the  full and firm
   breasts of...


20-HOPE(2):  Objection.  Deformation of character!  


21-MALAPROP(9):  Overruled.  Those are perfectly formed...of
   course, I don't see what relevance that has. 


222222-KKKAAAYYY SSSTTTOOONNNEEE(111):  Your Honour, we will show that the accused
   had  motive,  weapon,  and  opportunity  to  commit  this
   heinous  crime.   We will show beyond a shadow of a doubt
   that the accused, this  so  claimed  innocent  soul,  was
   present at the scene of the crime, and wielded the weapon
   against our beloved leader, for some  twisted,  demented,
   crazed  reason.   We  WILL  show you why no jury on earth
   could ever possibly forgive the horrendous crime that has
   been committed.  


23-LIBERTY(4):  Idiot, we're not on earth!  


24-STONE(2):   Uhh...why  there's  no  way  in Hell that she








   should get away with this murder!


(THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE AS STONE SITS DOWN AGAIN.) 


25-MALAPROP(10):  Mr. Hope?

26-HOPE(3):   Your  Honour,  I'm  up here to provide as much
   confusion, throw up as many smoke screens and mirrors  as
   at   all   possible  to  get  my  client  off  the  hook.
   Oh...um...I guess I shouldn't have  said  that...   Could
   you take that off the record please? 


27-MALAPROP(11):   Very  well, strike that last bit from the
   record.  


(BAILIFF DOES SO.  WE WON'T GO INTO DETAILS.  WE  PREFER  TO
TRUST THE DIRECTOR'S IMAGINATION.)  


28-MALAPROP(12):  Do you taunt to wry again?


29-HOPE(4):  Taunt to wry, your Honour? 


30-MALAPROP(13):  Yes, start from the beginning again.  


31-HOPE(5):   Oh!   Want  to  try  again!   No,  no  opening
   remarks. 


32-MALAPROP(14):  Mr. Liberty, you are at liberty to commen-
   cement.  


33-LIBERTY(5):   The  prosecution calls James Yogourt to the
   stand.   



34-MALAPROP(15):  Call James Yogourt to the stand.  


35-BAILIFF(2):  (YELLING AS LOUD AS POSSIBLE) JJJaaammmeeesss  YYYooogggooouuurrrttt

(YOGOURT SAUNTERS IN AND LOOKS FOR THE WITNESS BOX.)


36-MALAPROP(16):  Bailiff, swear in the witness.


37-BAILIFF(3):   So  back  up, you filthy swine.  Stop.  Now
   left, you misbegotten cretin.   No,  dirtbag,  the  other
   left.   Up, you tweezot ridden, overweight, stupid, flat-
   footed...


38-MALAPROP(17):  Bailiff!  Bailiff, that's fine.
