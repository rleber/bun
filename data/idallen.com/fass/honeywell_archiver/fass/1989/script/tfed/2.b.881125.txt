[L-1] (FADE IN FROM 2:1)                                     L

   who was who. 











222-NNNOOOAAAHHH HHHOOOPPPEEE(111):  Would you say that Satan was less  than  up
   front with you, Mr. Slobotnik?   


3-JAKE(2):  Well he certainly wasn't what I thought.


4-HOPE(2):  So Satan tricked you?   


5-JAKE(3):  Well...yeah.


6-HOPE(3):   Thank  you  Mr.  Slobotnik.   Your  Honour,  my
   learned colleagues opposite have based their case on  the
   following  points:  that  my  client first had motive for
   this crime because Satan had tricked her.


777-JJJUUUDDDGGGEEE MMMAAALLLAAAPPPRRROOOPPP(111):  Yes...


8-HOPE(4):  Yet Satan had also tricked Mr. Slobotnik, so Mr.
   Slobotnik also had motive.  Second, my learned colleagues
   attempted to show that my client had opportunity to  com-
   mit this crime.  


999-BBBIIILLLLLL LLLIIIBBBEEERRRTTTYYY(111):   Your Honour, we've been through this at
   length already!  


10-HOPE(5):  Yet Mr. Slobotnik just  admitted  that  he  was
   also  present  at  the  time  of  the murder.  Lastly the
   prosecution attempted to show that my  client  had  means
   for the crime, in her possession of a lethal weapon. 



111111-KKKAAAYYY SSSTTTOOONNNEEE(111):  Your Honour, is it necessary to repeat all
   this?


12-HOPE(6):  Yet Mr. Slobotnik has also stated that he  also
   had access to a lethal weapon at the time of the murder.

14-HOPE(7):   The  point, your Honour, is that Mr. Slobotnik
   could easily have been the  perpetrator  of  this  crime,
   which casts serious doubt on the prosecution's case. 


15-JAKE(4):  Now wait a minute! 


16-LIBERTY(2):   Your  Honour, Mr. Slobotnik was behind home
   plate when the murder occurred, not in  left  field.   He
   had  a baseball bat, not a trident, and he appears to en-
   joy his time in Hell, unlike  some  people!   (GLARES  AT
   LISA)  This is hardly consistent with Mr. Slobotnik being
   the  murderer.   We  submit  that  no  doubt   has   been
   established. 
















17-STONE(2):  (ASIDE) We also submit that the defense attor-
   ney be shot for the poor calibre of his performance. 


18-MALAPROP(2):  What was that, Ms. Stone?  


19-STONE(3):  Nothing, your Honour. 


20-MALAPROP(3):  You said something, I saw  you  whispering.
   Please state your comments to the court. 


21-STONE(4):  (RESIGNED) We also submit that the defense at-
   torney be shot, for the poor calibre of his performance. 


22-MALAPROP(4):  Oh.  So be it. 


(BAILIFF SHOOTS HOPE.)  


23-MALAPROP(5):  Oh dear.  I guess Mr. Hope has  no  further
   questions.  You may retire, Mr. Slobotnik.   


222444-BBBAAAIIILLLIIIFFFFFF(111):  But he's at the peak of his career!

26-STONE(5):  Get a new lawyer. 


27-LISA(2):  Where? 


28-MALAPROP(6):   The court will appoint a new solicitor for
   you.  Anyone here know anything about soliciting?


222999-PPPAAAMMM AAASSSSSSOOONNNIIICCC(111):  I watched a few episodes of Perry  Mason


   once.


30-MALAPROP(7):  Good enough!  Court appoints Pam Assonic as
   counsel for the defense.

31-LISA(3):  Hey, don't I get a say in this?


32-MALAPROP(8):   No.  Now be quiet or I'll have to hold you
   in confetti of court.


(BAILIFF BRANDISHES A BAG OF CONFETTI.  VARIOUS CLEANING AND
THEATRE PERSONNEL HAVE HEART ATTACKS.)  


33-MALAPROP(9):  Ms. Assonic, any opening remarks?  


34-PAM ASSONIC(2):   Yes, your Honour.  I'd like to say that
   I'm honoured  to  have  been  asked  to  assist  in  this
   historic case, and I would like to state that even though
   my client was found at the scene of the crime, covered in
   gore,  and  despite her untrustworthy nature, her threats
   against Satan, and her clear motive...  (PAUSE.  THEN  TO
   LISA) Are you sure you don't want to change your plea?   


35-LISA(4):  But I'm innocent!  


36-PAM ASSONIC(3):   Oh come on, you've heard the testimony.
   The only thing that hasn't been established is  that  you



   had  possession  of  the murder weapon at the time of the
   murder.  


37-LIBERTY(3):  We can prove that!  


38-STONE(6):  Call Mr. J. Jones to the stand.   


39-MALAPROP(10):  Haul in J. Jones. 


(BAILIFF DRAGS JUGHEAD IN BY THE SCRUFF OF HIS NECK.)   


40-LIBERTY(4):  Now Mr. Jones,  you  were  at  the  baseball
   game, were you not?  


41-PAM ASSONIC(4):   Objection!   This  witness  hasn't been
   qualified.   


42-MALAPROP(11):  This witness isn't qualified,  but  that's
   beside the point.


43-PAM ASSONIC(5):   No  your  Honour,  he  hasn't given his
   name, address, or occupation for the record. 


44-MALAPROP(12):  Counselor, if you want his name and  phone
   number,  get  it  on  your own time, and keep your social
   life out of the courtroom.  Mr. Liberty, you may precis. 


45-LIBERTY(5):   Very  well,  to  sum  up,  Mr.  Jones   has
   established  that  the  accused had the means, to wit the
   murder weapon, in her  possession  at  the  time  of  the
   crime.
