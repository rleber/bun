   ness.


222-EEELLLIIIZZZAAA LLLOOOTTTTTT(111):  Party Pooper!

   to lead? 


4-HOPE(2):  But that's sexist, your Honour. 


5-MALAPROP(2):  Overruled.  


666-BBBIIILLLLLL LLLIIIBBBEEERRRTTTYYY(111):  So Satan tricked Ms  Griement  in  their
   first meeting?   


7-ELIZA(2):   Yes,  he  always  did  enjoy  acquiring  souls
   through elocutionary agreements. 


888-PPPAAAMMM AAASSSSSSOOONNNIIICCC(111):  What?


999-BBBAAAIIILLLIIIFFFFFF(111):  Elocutionary agreements...fancy  word  games,
   like when people interpret figures of speech literally.  


10-ASSONIC(2):  I know that!  How do you spell it?  


11-BAILIFF(2):  I. T.   


12-ASSONIC(3):  Cut it out. 


(BAILIFF  PRODUCES  A  PAIR OF SCISSORS AND A PIECE OF PAPER

(BAILIFF  LEAVES.   WE  HEAR  A  LOUD SPLASH.  BAILIFF LATER
RETURNS SOAKING WET.)   


13-LIBERTY(2):  And  did  Ms.  Griement  appreciate  Satan's
   little joke? 


14-ELIZA(3):   No.   She said she was mad as Hell and wasn't
   going to take it any more.   


15-LIBERTY(3):  Thank you, Mrs Lott.  Your Honour,  as  this
   witness  has  clearly  shown, Ms Griement obviously had a
   motive to dispatch the Supreme Sleazy Slumlord.  


16-HOPE(3):  (JUMPING IN QUICKLY BEFORE  HE  IS  BROWBEATEN)
   Now Mrs. ELIZA, you are also a slumlord--


17-ELIZA(4):   I'm  _n_o_t  a slumlord.  I'm a Student Domicile  
   Optimization Engineer.   


18-HOPE(4):  Very well.  As a Student Domicile  Optimization
   Engineer,  you  have  encountered many potential tenants,
   have you not?


19-ELIZA(5):  (LEERY) Yes.  


20-HOPE(5):  And where you have more applicants than  vacan-
   cies,  you  must  choose  who will become the new tenant,

   must you not??   


21-ELIZA(6):  Yes.  


22-HOPE(6):  (RHETORICALLY) And how do you do this? 


23-ELIZA(7):  Well, first I see who can pay the rather exor-
   bitant rent...   


24-HOPE(7):   (CONTINUES  WITHOUT HEARING A WORD ELIZA SAYS)
   Of course, you make  snap  decisions,  do  you  not,  Mrs
   Lott...  


25-ELIZA(8):   Then  I  find  out  what indignations they're
   willing to suffer to get the apartment...


26-HOPE(8):  In other words, ten seconds of meaningless con-
   versation, and boom, it's tenant or bum...   


27-ELIZA(9):  Finally I see how many twisted perverted lurid
   sexual acts they can perform.


28-HOPE(9):   In  short  you...   (DOUBLE  TAKE)  ...perform
   twisted  perverted  sexual acts??  You devil, you harlot,
   you painted Jezebel.  I have only one  thing  to  say  to
   someone of your ilk...

30-LIBERTY(4):    I   take   it  your  cross-examination  is
   finished?


31-MALAPROP(3):   Very  well,  Mrs  Lott,   you   are   mis-
   dissed...dismissed.  


(ELIZA AND REPORTER LEAVE, TALKING TO EACH OTHER)   


32-HOPE(10):   Your  Honour, bail for my client has not been
   set, and she is currently in captivity  in  a  cell  that
   makes Mrs Eliza's place look like the Taj Mahal. 


333333-KKKAAAYYY SSSTTTOOONNNEEE(111):   Your  Honour,  prosecution  requests that
   bail be  denied  for  this  fiery,  deranged,  hot-headed
   murderess.   


34-MALAPROP(4):   What  grounds do you have to flake maiming
   accusations? 


35-LIBERTY(5):  We have a witness who will show that the ac-
   cused  cannot  be trusted to comply with the terms of her
   bail agreement.  


36-MALAPROP(5):  Very well, summon your witness.


37-STONE(2):  Summon Natasha Badanov to the stand.  


38-BAILIFF(3):   (PULLS  OUT  A  CRYSTAL  BALL)  Abracadabra
   Kalamazoo, Natasha Badanov, we summon you.   


(NATASHA TAKES STAND)   


39-STONE(3):  Please state your name and occupation.

   founding members of SOUL.


41-STONE(4):  What is SOUL? 


42-NATASHA(2):  Sort of a religious type music, but more  of
   pop orientation. 


43-STONE(5):   What  is the SOUL of which you are a founding
   member?  


44-NATASHA(3):  Is underground conspiracy.  SOUL stands  for
   Secret Organization to Undermine Lucifer.


45-STONE(6):  And this conspiracy is where you first encoun-
   tered the accused, Ms Griement?  


46-NATASHA(4):  Yes, darlink.
