ENTERS, A SWEET YOUNG THING WEARING AN  OVER-SIZED  BASEBALL
SHIRT  WITH  MOOSE'S  NAME  AND NUMBER ON IT.  SHE ADDRESSES
MOOSE'S LOCKER, IDENTIFIABLE  BY  THE  BIG  PHOTO  OF  MOOSE
TACKED ON THE DOOR.)











111-SSSAAALLLLLLYYY FFFIIIFFFTTTHHH(111):   Moose, we have to talk... about us.  No.
   Moose, this has gone on long enough...  No.  Moose,  I've
   been doing a lot of thinking...  No...   


(MOOSE ENTERS, DEJECTED, CARRYING A SHOE BOX.)  


222-MMMOOOOOOSSSEEE EEESSSSSSEEEXXX(111):  Oh, hi, Sally.   


3-SALLY(2):  Hi, Moose.  How was the game?  


4-MOOSE(2):   (DEPRESSED) We won 12-1.  I pitched a complete
   game 4-hitter.  Jake threw out 4 of 5 runners  trying  to
   steal and hit two home runs. 


5-SALLY(3):  Don't worry, honey.  This slump can't last much
   longer.  


(MOOSE TAKES A NEW PAIR OF SHOES FROM THE BOX AND BEGINS  TO
TRY LACING THEM EVENLY.)


   Moose, can we talk?  


6-MOOSE(3):  Whuh?  Oh, yeah, sure thing.   


(WHILE  SALLY  IS  TURNED  AWAY TO DELIVER HER BRAVE SPEECH,
MOOSE IS HAVING A LOT OF TROUBLE LACING THOSE  SHOES.   IT'S
TRAGIC  WHAT THE ATHLETIC SCHOLARSHIP SYSTEM HAS DONE TO THE
STATE OF EDUCATION.)


7-SALLY(4):  Moose, we've been seeing each other  for  about
   six weeks now... 

















8-MOOSE(4):  (THE LACE ENDS DON'T MATCH AT ALL.) Uh, longer,
   I think.

9-SALLY(5):  How do you feel about our relationship?


10-MOOSE(5):  (HOW DID HE GET TANGLED UP LIKE THAT?) I don't
   think it's working.  


11-SALLY(6):  Exactly.  Moose, I don't think we  can  go  on
   like this.  Do you?  


12-MOOSE(6):   (TANGLED IN A NEW AND EVEN MORE EXCITING WAY)
   Uh-uh.   


13-SALLY(7):  Are you looking for more commitment, or less? 


14-MOOSE(7):  (PULLING THE LACE  WARILY.  THIS  HASN'T  GONE
   WELL.) More. 


15-SALLY(8):  Moose, I'm looking for true love. 


16-MOOSE(8):  (WAIT, THIS LOOKS LIKE... IT IS... EVEN ENDS!)
   I think I've got it. 


17-SALLY(9):  You have?  True, perfect, eternal love?   


18-MOOSE(9):  Yeah, dat's it.   


19-SALLY(10):  Is it...  Is it me, Moose?   


20-MOOSE(10):  Oh, yeah!


21-SALLY(11):  Oh, Moose!  Will you marry me?   


22-MOOSE(11):  (TRIUMPHANTLY) Yeah, yeah, yeah! 





23-SALLY(12):  Oh, Moose!   


(SALLY TURNS TO DISCOVER MOOSE JUBILANTLY TYING HIS SHOE.)  


   Oh, Moose.   


24-MOOSE(12):   So,  Sally,  didn't  you  wanna  talk  about
   somethin'?   


25-SALLY(13):  No, Moose.

************************************************************
*****               Baseball On His Mind               *****
*****                  to the tune of                  *****
*****                 Gentle On My Mind                *****
************************************************************




   It's knowing that the slightest hint of romance makes
   this baseball player balk,   
   That makes me wish that I could find the strength to say 
   "I'm out of here" and walk.  
   For although he's pitcher perfect,   
   And at ball games he's a winner, 
   To all types of love and passion he is blind.
   Which means that I'm the loser.  








   So, I guess I'll hit the showers,
   'Cause he's got only baseball on his mind.   


   One evening, I was planning a seduction, 
   so I asked him to my place.  
   I should have known I'd never even have a chance 
   to make it to first base.
   I turned all of the lights down, 
   and slipped off to the bedroom,  
   And came back nearly naked just to find, 
   Him sitting at the TV,   
   watching reruns of the Blue Jays,
   'Cause he's got only baseball on his mind.   


(JAKE ENTERS.)  


26-MOOSE(13):  Hey, Jake!  How  come  you  let  dat  turtle,
   Jackson, steal second?

   curve, go-nad.   


28-MOOSE(14):  But you asked for...  Wait a minute.   Is  it
   one  finger,  fastball,  two fingers, curve, or the other
   way around?  


29-JAKE(2):  (PATIENTLY) The finger that is single means the
   thrower  must  be slower.  The digit that is double means
   the cast that is fast.   


30-MOOSE(15):  The digit that is single  means  the  thrower
   must be fast.  No.   









[L-2]  (LIGHTS  DIM  ON JAKE, MOOSE AND SALLY.  LIGHTS UP ON L  
SATAN AND ABBEY ENTERING  A  SEPARATE  AREA  OF  THE  STAGE.

   incredible body to  seduce  them  into  playing  for  the
   devil.  Right.   


33-SATAN(2):  Wrong.  This calls for a professional,

   safe.  Even so, we dug into the diamond like a spade.  So
   we came into the clubhouse where you opened  your  hearts
   to us.   


69-SALLY(18):   (BRIGHTLY)  Did  you  puke?   I always heave

   You have such powerful hands.  Are you any good?
