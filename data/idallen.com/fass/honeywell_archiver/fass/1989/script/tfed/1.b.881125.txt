111-NNNOOOAAAHHH HHHOOOPPPEEE(111):   Objection!   Prosecution  is  entertaining
   hearsay.

333-BBBIIILLLLLL LLLIIIBBBEEERRRTTTYYY(111):  No further questions, your honour.  This
   man  has proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that the ac-
   cused was present at the scene  of  the  crime  with  the
   murder weapon in her hands.  


444-DDDWWWEEEEEEBBB JJJIIIMMM YYYOOOGGGOOOUUURRRTTT(111):  What...oh yeah.


5-LIBERTY(2):   The  defence  may wish to cross-examine, but
   with an unimpeachable, informed,  and  impartial  witness
   such  as  Mr Yogourt, any cross-examination would clearly
   be futile.   


(LIBERTY SITS DOWN.  HOPE STANDS UP TO  CROSS-EXAMINE.   KAY

6-HOPE(2):  Er...no questions, your Honour.  (HE SITS.) 


7-MALAPROP(2):  Very well, Mr Sherbert.  You may withdraw.

10-REPORTER(2):   I'm  with  the  National Expirer and we're
   just dying to get your story.


11-LISA(2):  I thought you were with the Record.

   the nose.


17-LISA(5):  Sorry, I'm attached to my nostrils.


18-REPORTER(6):   I  can  get  you a full credit in PHIL 140
   without you having to do any work.   


19-LISA(6):  You already get  a  full  credit  in  PHIL  140
   without doing any work.  


20-REPORTER(7):  Listen, we can help get you out of here.   








21-LISA(7):  Start by getting me a real lawyer. 


22-REPORTER(8):   Why don't you defend yourself.  You'd make
   a great solicitor.   


(LISA DAMAGES REPORTER.)


   On the other hand.   


23-MALAPROP(3):  If you're quite finished, Ms  Griement,  we
   could get on with your trial.


(LISA SITS DOWN.)

   housing, do you not?

   infested, rundown, poorly contructed apartment  buildings

444111-KKKAAAYYY SSSTTTOOONNNEEE(111):  So what?  


42-MALAPROP(6):  Overruled. 


43-LIBERTY(9):   In  your  capacity  as  slumlord,  you were
   present at the first meeting of the accused and the  Late
