   Attorney, you may cross-pollinate the witless.   











222-NNNOOOAAAHHH HHHOOOPPPEEE(111):  I beg your pardon? 


333-BBBAAAIIILLLIIIFFFFFF(111):   I  believe Your Worship means "cross-examine
   the witness".


4-JUDGE(2):  (TO BAILIFF) Don't tell me what I mean.  I  say
   what  I  mean,  and  I  mean  what  I  say.   (TO DEFENSE
   ATTORNEY) Now, do you want to cross-exasperate the  spit-
   less, or not?


5-HOPE(2):  Umm...  no questions, your Honour.  


6-JUDGE(3):  Very well. 


7-HOPE(3):  That's all right, isn't it? 


8-JUDGE(4):  What?  


9-HOPE(4):   It's  okay  that  I  don't have any devastating
   questions to ask, isn't it?  


10-JUDGE(5):  What on earth are you talking about?  


11-HOPE(5):   I  mean,  um,  this  is  my  first  trial  and
   everything, and I want to make sure I get it right.  


12-JUDGE(6):  You seem to be doing all right so far.


13-HOPE(6):  Are you sure?  I feel so uncomfortable.


14-JUDGE(7):  Relax.  You're doing fine.  (TO WITNESS) Isn't
   he doing fine?

111777-KKKAAAYYY SSSTTTOOONNNEEE(111):   Definite legal talent.  No question about
   it.  


18-HOPE(7):  Thanks, guys.  I really appreciate it. 


19-JUDGE(8):  Don't worry about  it.   Everyone  needs  some
   reinsurance  now  and  again.   (TO WITNESS) You may step
   down.  (TO BAILIFF) Bailiff, cull the next witness.  


20-BAILIFF(2):  I beg your pardon?  


21-JUDGE(9):  You heard me.  Cull the next witness! 


22-BAILIFF(3):  If you insist.  


(BAILIFF EXITS) 


23-JUDGE(10):  Was that the right word? 


24-LIBERTY(2):  No, I'm afraid not, your Honour.


25-JUDGE(11):  Oh, dear...  


(A SHOT OFFSTAGE.  BAILIFF REAPPEARS)   


   I hate it when that happens. 


26-BAILIFF(4):  What should I do now, your Honour?  


27-JUDGE(12):  (TO HIMSELF) Let me try that again.  


(CLEARS THROAT) 








   Collate the next witness.


28-BAILIFF(5):  Your wish is my command, your Honour.   


(SOUND  OF  ELABORATE  PHOTOCOPYING  MACHINE  AND   SCREAMS.
BAILIFF REAPPEARS)  


   Would you like the witness laminated, your Honour?   


29-JUDGE(13):   No,  no.  For crying out loud, I meant "call
   the next witness".  Why must you take everything I say so
   literally?   


30-BAILIFF(6):  It's my job, your Honour.   


31-JUDGE(14):   God, I hate the civil service.  Mr. Liberty,
   why don't _y_o_u call the next witness?  I want to get  this  
   trail over with.

32-BAILIFF(7):  Trial.  


33-JUDGE(15):  Whatever.


34-LIBERTY(3):   (TO  STONE)  You  heard the man -- call the
   next witness!


35-STONE(2):  I thought _y_o_u had the list of witnesses.


36-LIBERTY(4):  I gave it to you.  Don't tell  me  you  lost
   it.  


37-STONE(3):  Ummm... er... it's not so much "lost" as "spa-
   tially ambiguous".   







38-JUDGE(16):  Get on with it!  


39-LIBERTY(5):  Very well.  I shall now  (GLARES  AT  STONE)
   give  my  closing  argument.  Ladies and gentlemen of the
   jury:  look at the face of the defendant.   Is  this  not
   the  perfectly  formed nose of a murderer?  Are these not
   the perfectly capped teeth of  a  homicidal  maniac?   Is
   this not the dimpled chin of a psychopath?  Are these not
   the full and firm breasts of --  


(JUDGE CLEARS THROAT LOUDLY)


   Sorry, your honour.  I got carried away. 


40-STONE(4):  I'll handle this.  Members of the  jury:   you
   have  before you conclusive evidence that proves beyond a
   shadow of a doubt with no  possibility  of  contradiction
   that  the  defendant  which  stands before you is a cold-
   blooded, heartless, ruthless, scheming, conniving killer.


(ENTIRE COURT BURSTS INTO APPLAUSE) 


   Thank you.   


(PAUSE) 


   Ummm...  er... (TO LIBERTY) What do I say now?   


(LIBERTY WHISPERS TO STONE) 


   (DRAMATICALLY) The prosecution arrests your Honour.  


41-LIBERTY(6):  No, you idiot!  (WHACKS STONE WITH  A  FOAM-











   RUBBER MALLET, ESPECIALLY DESIGNED FOR COURTROOM WORK)   


42-JUDGE(17):  (TO STONE) Are you making fun of me? 


43-STONE(5):  No, er...

44-JUDGE(18):   I  don't like it when people make fun of me.
   Bailiff, take that man away and have him shot.   


45-BAILIFF(8):  Um... sir...


46-JUDGE(19):  Hurry up.  Fill him  full  of  lead,  mister.
   I'm waiting. 


47-BAILIFF(9):   Sir,  we're  not allowed to kill members of
   the legal profession anymore.


48-JUDGE(20):  We're not?   


49-BAILIFF(10):  I'm afraid not.


50-JUDGE(21):  Oh, drat.  I hate it  when  they  change  the
   rules.  I guess I'll just have to charge you with confet-
   ti of court. 


(SPRINKLES CONFETTI ON STONE)   


   Bailiff, haul this hooligan hurriedly to the hoosegow.   


(BRIEF PAUSE.  EVERYONE LOOKS STUNNED)  


   How on earth did I manage to say that?   


(BAILIFF GRABS STONE AND HAULS HER, ETC.)   










   Does the defense wish to call any witnesses? 


51-HOPE(8):  Just one, your Honour.  Call Sam Robin.


(ENTER ROBIN)   


52-BAILIFF(11):  Do you swear to tell the truth,  the  whole
   truth, and nothing but the truth?


555333-SSSAAAMMM RRROOOBBBIIINNN(111):  No.   


54-BAILIFF(12):  No?


55-ROBIN(2):   How  can  I  do that?  I don't know the whole
   truth.  If I knew the whole truth, you  wouldn't  need  a
   trial.   That's  what we're here for, isn't it?  To piece
   the truth together bit by bit.  Your Honour  should  know
   this, having been in the trial business so long. 


(MURMURS OF AGREEMENT)  


56-BAILIFF(13):   All  right, already.  Do you swear to tell
   little bits of the truth?


57-ROBIN(3):  I do.

58-BAILIFF(14):  Take the stand.


59-ROBIN(4):  Where should I take it?   


60-BAILIFF(15):  That's an old joke, sir.   


61-ROBIN(5):  That's all right -- I'm an old witness.   





62-HOPE(9):  Mr. Robin, state your occupation.  


63-ROBIN(6):  I am a poisoner of minds. 


64-HOPE(10):  I beg your pardon?


65-ROBIN(7):  I am a television producer.   


66-LIBERTY(7):  By God, he is telling the truth!


67-HOPE(11):  And you were in charge of producing the broad-
   cast of the game at  which  His  Satanic  Victimness  was
   killed, right?   


(NOTE:  AT THIS POINT, TECHIES ENTER AND MAKE THE STAGE LOOK
LIKE A GIANT TELEVISION SCREEN) 


68-ROBIN(8):  (MODESTLY) Well, an effort like this  requires
   the  work  of several talented people; I just happened to
   be the one whose name got on the credits first.  


69-LIBERTY(8):  In large pink letters which flashed.


70-HOPE(12):  Objection!


71-JUDGE(22):  On what grounds? 


72-HOPE(13):  The prosecution is mocking my witness.


73-JUDGE(23):  So?  


74-HOPE(14):  I am the only one allowed to do that. 


75-JUDGE(24):  Objection sustained. 


(TECHIES ARE DONE BY NOW)   


76-HOPE(15):  With Your Honour's permission, I would like to
   show a portion of the taped broadcast of the game on this






   536 inch living colour TV.  (TO ROBIN)  Can  we  take  it
   from the beginning of the rain delay?


77-ROBIN(9):  Sure thing.
