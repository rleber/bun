666-AAAGGGEEENNNTTT 888666(111):   Hi,  Mom.  Look, I found a new recruit wan-
   dering around.  Can we keep her? 


(MOTHER GRASPS 86'S HAND AND SWATS IT WITH A RULER.)


7-MOTHER(2):  You naughty, naughty spy.  How could you  risk
   our new base by bringing in a stranger?  


8-86(2):   Don't worry.  Not even a Indian scout working for
   the Tenth Cavalry could have followed us.


9-MOTHER(3):  I find that hard to believe.  










10-86(3):  Would you believe a boy scout working on a  merit
   badge?   


11-MOTHER(4):  No.  


12-86(4):  How about a talent scout working for the Leafs?  


111333-LLLIIISSSAAA(111):  I'm Lisa.  Who are you?


111444-JJJOOOHHHNNN DDDRRRAAAKKKEEE(111):  John Drake.  I'm a secret agent, ma'am.  


15-MOTHER(5):  Since you already know where our secret head-
   quarters are, we might as well let you join.   Just  sign
   here.


16-LISA(2):  What if I don't want to join?  


17-SNAKE(2):  Then we'll kill you.  


18-LISA(3):  Where do I sign?   


19-MOTHER(6):  (TO 86) I suppose you tell every stranger you
   meet about the new base? 


20-86(5):  Not me, chief.  Geraldo Rivera couldn't drag  the
   location out of me.

(86 TAKES THE PIZZA.)   


   Double cheese, pepperoni, and anchovies?

23-PIZZA BOY(2):  Snake Pliskin!  I thought you were dead!  


24-DRAKE(2):   I suspect the security of our master plan may
   have been compromised.  Time for plan B. 


(MURMURS OF GENERAL AGREEMENT.) 


25-MOTHER(7):  If only we had a plan B.

29-MOTHER(8):   (ANSWERING  PHONE  ON TABLE) Hello, S.O.U.L.
   secret headquarters.  Mother speaking.   (LISTENS  FOR  A
   MOMENT)  Bless  you,  my  son.   Good-bye.   That was the
   Saint.  He has  discovered  that  Satan,  like  all  evil













   masterminds,  has  a  secret  control panel with which he
   runs his operations. 


30-SOLO(3):  And  where  there's  a  secret  control  panel,
   there's  a  secret  self-destruct  sequence.  Right!  I'm
   off! 


31-DRAKE(3):  Just like Solo to go off on his own.  


32-MOTHER(9):  Your mission, should you choose to accept it,
   is to infiltrate the secret Hell Master Control Room, and
   blow it up.  If you or any of  your  S.O.U.L.  mates  are
   caught or killed in action, don't worry about it.  You're
   already in Hell.  Good luck.  This nun will self-destruct
   in five seconds. 


[X-1] (MOTHER SELF-DESTRUCTS)                                X  


33-86(7):  I hate it when she does that.


34-DRAKE(4):  Old habits die hard.  


35-STEED(2):   Now,  how  are  we  going  to find the secret
   panel?   


36-HOGAN(2):  Don't worry.  I have another one of  my  bril-
   liant plans.

   Do any of you know where we can get some parkas, a bottle
   of whiskey, and an wood stove?   


(TO 86 AND LISA)


   Oh, you two can stay here and...guard the base.  


37-NATASHA(2):  I'll organise a diversion.  


(EXIT HOGAN, STEED, DRAKE, SNAKE, AND NATASHA.) 


38-LISA(4):  I'm not going to just sit  here.   How  are  we
   going to find Hell Master Control?   


39-86(8):  Why don't we just ask Satan where it is? 


40-LISA(5):  Get Smart! 


(BRIEF PAUSE AS THEY THINK) 


   I've  got  it.  We'll disguise ourselves as repair people
   and tell Satan we need to get at  the  control  panel  to
   make some adjustments.   


41-86(9):   Wait!   How  about  if  we disguise ourselves as
   repair people and tell Satan we need to get at  the  con-
   trol panel to make some adjustments? 


42-LISA(6):  I couldn't have said it better myself.

68-HOGAN(6):   Brimstone  fever.   Very  deadly.  Very rare.
   Only appears when Hell freezes over.

71-HOGAN(7):  Screams?  I didn't  hear  anything.   Did  you
   hear anything, Snake?

   time left.   


77-SATAN(9):  What do you mean "not much time left"?  What's
   going to happen? 


78-DRAKE(10):  The last sign is a racing pulse, followed  by
   death.   


79-SATAN(10):   (CHECKS PULSE) It _i_s getting faster.  Quick,
   what's the cure? 


80-HOGAN(9):  Turn up the heat.

   able to tell if it's getting hotter. 


82-HOGAN(10):  Not to worry, sir.  We'll let you know.
