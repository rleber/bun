Broadcasters,   
they're all alike!  
Serving lowest-common-denominator pap to the great unwashed.
Radio and television:  the ravenous maw of the sports   
network, gobbling up good sports stories and chewing them up
to vomit them back, pre-digested, into the cheeping 
mouths of their bird-brained audiences. 
Baseball wasn't meant to
be seen, it was meant to be read.   
Box scores, wire photos 
and something to wrap the garbage in when you're finished.  
Now that's journalism!
