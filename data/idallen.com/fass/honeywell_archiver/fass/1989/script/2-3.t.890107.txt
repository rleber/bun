The temperature is near-freezing, with a gale-force wind blowing from   
the north-west...   
.ad 
(TRANSLATOR SHOULD NOW POSITION SELF SLIGHTLY BEHIND FERGIE AND 
BUCK AS THE PRECEDING LINE IS TRANSLATED INTO SIGN LANGUAGE.
THIS LEAVES TRANSLATOR IN PERFECT POSITION TO MAKE FACES AT FERGIE AND BUCK 
AS THE FOLLOWING TRANSLATIONS ARE BEING PERFORMED.) 
.ch tr  
(SIGNING)   
Fergie is a blithering idiot, and only those of us who know sign language   
can understand this speech. 
.ch bu  
(POINTING OUT THE WINDOW)   
It's not raining.   
.ch fe  
Just a minute.  
I'm almost done.
.ch tr  
(SIGNING)   
Wait!   
.ch fe  
(RESUMING READING FROM THE SCRIPT)  
And yet, for some reason, the teams have not reappeared on the field.   
Buck, I don't understand.   
.ch tr  
(SIGNING)   
Isn't it neat that we can say things that most of the audience can't hear?  
.ch bu  
Fergie, it's not raining.   
We're in hell.  
They can't play baseball until it starts raining again. 
.ch tr  
(SIGNING)   
This dialogue is awful. 
Who wrote this crap anyway? 
.ch fe  
Oh.

Oh.

How long, O Lord, how long?

(FERGIE STARTS TO CRY)  
.ch bu  
Mother told me there would be days like this.

How many sign language experts does it take to change a light bulb? 
.ch bu  
There, there, don't cry.
.ch tr

One, as long as I don't talk!   
Ha! Ha! Ha!

Here.   
Fix your face.  
Now repeat after me.
.ch fe  
After me.   
.ch bu  
In the beginning of this big inning,
Bell's the batter and he's bitter about his bunting 
because Beanball Bailey's the better bunter 
but with Brinkley Bass and Boss Bull on base,   
Bell can't bet on anything but a bunt.

I see Billy, and Betty, and Susie...
.ch bu  
Not that window.

(BUCK TURNS FERGIE TO FACE A DIFFERENT WINDOW.) 
.ch fe  
I see... steam rising from the outfield.
It's kind of romantic, in its own way.  
.ch bu  
I'm sure it is, Fergie. 
Now, tell those good people in television land what's   
happening in the ballgame.  
.ch fe  
Umm... it's the top of the seventh inning with two men on, two men out  
and one not quite extinguished. 
.ch bu  
There.  
That wasn't so bad, was it? 
.ch fe  
No. 
Thanks, Buck.   
You're so good to me.
