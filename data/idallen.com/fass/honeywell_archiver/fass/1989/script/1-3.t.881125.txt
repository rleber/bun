Bless you, my son.  
Good-bye.   
That was the Saint. 
He has discovered that Satan, like all evil masterminds, has
a secret control panel with which he runs his operations.   
.ch ns  
And where there's a secret control panel, there's a secret  
self-destruct sequence. 
Right!  
I'm off!
.ch jd  
Just like Solo to go off on his own.
.ch mo  
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to infiltrate  
the secret Hell Master Control Room, and blow it up.
If you or any of your S.O.U.L. mates are caught or killed in action,
don't worry about it.   
You're already in Hell. 
Good luck.  
This nun will self-destruct in five seconds.
