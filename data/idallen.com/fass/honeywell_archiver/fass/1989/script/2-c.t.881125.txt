(TO DEFENSE ATTORNEY)   
Mr. Defensive Attorney, you may cross-pollinate the witless.
.ch ho  
I beg your pardon?  
.ch ba  
I believe Your Worship means "cross-examine the witness".   
.ch ju  
(TO BAILIFF)
Don't tell me what I mean.  
I say what I mean, and I mean what I say.   
(TO DEFENSE ATTORNEY)   
Now, do you want to cross-exasperate the spitless, or not?  
.ch ho  
Umm...  no questions, your Honour.  
.ch ju  
Very well.  
.ch ho  
That's all right, isn't it? 
.ch ju  
What?   
.ch ho  
It's okay that I don't have any devastating questions to ask, isn't it? 
.ch ju  
What on earth are you talking about?
.ch ho  
I mean, um, this is my first trial and everything, and I want to make sure  
I get it right. 
.ch ju  
You seem to be doing all right so far.  
.ch ho  
Are you sure?   
I feel so uncomfortable.
.ch ju  
Relax.  
You're doing fine.  
(TO WITNESS)
Isn't he doing fine?
.ch wi  
Yes, I think so.
.ch li  
I agree.
.ch st  
Definite legal talent.  
No question about it.   
.ch ho  
Thanks, guys.   
I really appreciate it. 
.ch ju  
Don't worry about it.   
Everyone needs some reinsurance now and again.  
(TO WITNESS)
You may step down.  
(TO BAILIFF)
Bailiff, cull the next witness. 
.ch ba  
I beg your pardon?  
.ch ju  
You heard me.   
Cull the next witness!  
.ch ba  
If you insist.  
.ad 
(BAILIFF EXITS) 
.ch ju  
Was that the right word?
.ch li  
No, I'm afraid not, your Honour.
.ch ju  
Oh, dear... 
.ad 
(A SHOT OFFSTAGE.  BAILIFF REAPPEARS)   
.ex 
I hate it when that happens.
.ch ba  
What should I do now, your Honour?  
.ch ju  
(TO HIMSELF)
Let me try that again.  
.ad 
(CLEARS THROAT)

Collate the next witness.

.ex 
Would yo

Would you like the witness laminated, your Honour?  
.ch ju  
No, no.  For crying out loud, I meant "call the next witness".  Why must
you take everything I say so literally? 
.ch ba  
It's my job, your Honour.   
.ch ju  
God, I hate the civil service.  
Mr. Liberty, why don't  
.ul 
you 
call the next witness?  
I want to get this trail over with. 
.ch ba  
Trial.  
.ch ju  
Whatever.   
.ch li  
(TO STONE)  
You heard the man -- call the next witness! 
.ch st  
I thought   
.ul 
you 
had the list of witnesses.  
.ch li  
I gave it to you.   
Don't tell me you lost it.  
.ch st  
Ummm... er... it's not so much "lost" as "spatially ambiguous". 
.ch ju  
Get on with it! 
.ch li  
Very well.  
I shall now (GLARES AT STONE) give my closing argument. 
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury:  look at the face of the defendant.   
Is this not the perfectly formed nose of a murderer?
Are these not the perfectly capped teeth of a homicidal maniac? 
Is this not the dimpled chin of a psychopath?   
Are these not the full and firm breasts of --   
.ad 
(JUDGE CLEARS THROAT LOUDLY)
.ex 
Sorry, your honour. 
I got carried away. 
.ch st  

I'll handle this.   
Members of the jury:  you have before you conclusive evidence that proves   
beyond a shadow of a doubt with no possibility of contradiction that the
defendant which stands before you is a cold-blooded, heartless, ruthless,   
scheming, conniving killer. 
.ad 
(ENTIRE COURT BURSTS INTO APPLAUSE) 
.ex 
Thank you.  
.ad 
(PAUSE) 
.ex 
Ummm...  er... (TO LIBERTY) What do I say now?

No, you idiot!  
(WHACKS STONE WITH A FOAM-RUBBER MALLET, ESPECIALLY DESIGNED FOR COURTROOM WORK)
.ch ju  
(TO STONE)  
Are you making fun of me?   
.ch st  
No, er...   
.ch ju  
I don't like it when people make fun of me. 
Bailiff, take that man away and have him shot.  
.ch ba  
Um... sir...
.ch ju  
Hurry up.   
Fill him full of lead, mister.  
I'm waiting.
.ch ba  
Sir, we're not allowed to kill members of the legal profession anymore. 
.ch ju  
We're not?  
.ch ba  
I'm afraid not. 
.ch ju  
Oh, drat.   
I hate it when they change the rules.   
I guess I'll just have to charge you with confetti of court.
.ad 
(SPRINKLES CONFETTI ON STONE)   
.ex 
Bailiff, haul this hooligan hurriedly to the hoosegow.  
.ad 
(BRIEF PAUSE.

How on earth did I manage to say that?  
.ad 
(BAILIFF GRABS STONE AND HAULS HER, ETC.)   
.ex 
Does the defense wish to call any witnesses?
.ch ho  
Just one, your Honour.  
Call Sam Robin. 
.ad 
(ENTER ROBIN)   
.ch ba  
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? 
.ch ro  
No. 
.ch ba  
No? 
.ch ro  
How can I do that?  
I don't know the whole truth.   
If I knew the whole truth, you wouldn't need a trial.   
That's what we're here for, isn't it?   
To piece the truth together bit by bit. 
Your Honour should know this, having been in the trial business so long.
.ad 
(MURMURS OF AGREEMENT)  
.ch ba  
All right, already. 
Do you swear to tell little bits of the truth?  
.ch ro  
I do.   
.ch ba  
Take the stand. 
.ch ro  
Where should I take it? 
.ch ba  
That's an old joke, sir.
.ch ro  
That's all right -- I'm an old witness. 
.ch ho  
Mr. Robin, state your occupation.   
.ch ro  
I am a poisoner of minds.   
.ch ho  
I beg your pardon?  
.ch ro  
I am a television producer. 
.ch li  
By God, he is telling the truth!
.ch ho  
And you were in charge of producing the broadcast of the game at which  
His Satanic Victimness was killed, right?   
.ad 
(NOTE:  AT THIS POINT, TECHIES ENTER AND MAKE THE STAGE LOOK LIKE A 
GIANT TELEVISION SCREEN)
.ch ro  
(MODESTLY)  
Well, an effort like this requires the work of several talented people; 
I just happened to be the one whose name got on the credits first.  
.ch li  
In large pink letters which flashed.
.ch ho  
Objection!  
.ch ju  
On what grounds?
.ch ho  
The prosecution is mocking my witness.  
.ch ju  
So? 
.ch ho  
I am the only one allowed to do that.   
.ch ju  
Objection sustained.
.ad 
(TECHIES ARE DONE BY NOW)   
.ch ho  
With Your Honour's permission, I would like to show a portion of the
taped broadcast of the game on this 536 inch living colour TV.

Can we take it from the beginning of the rain delay?
.ch ro  
Sure thing.
