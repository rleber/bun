THE STAGE IS DIVIDED INTO TWO AREAS:
SOUL HEADQUARTERS AND THE GATES OF HELL.
SOUL HQ IS A TYPICAL SECRET HQ SET COMPLETE WITH A LARGE SIGN THAT READS:   
"SECRET ORGANISATION TO UNDERMINE LUCIFER". 
MOTHER, A NUN, IS SEATED AT A CONFERENCE TABLE WITH NAPOLEON SOLO,  
JOHN DRAKE, NATASHA, COLONEL HOGAN AND JOHN STEED.) 
.ch mo  
Welcome to the first meeting of the Secret Organisation 
to Undermine Lucifer.   

In life, each of you was a spy -- yes, Mr. Drake?   
.ch jd  
I wasn't a spy; I was a secret agent, ma'am.
.ch mo  
You must beware the seven deadly sins.  
Mr. Drake, would you list them? 
.ch jd  
Anger, avarice, gluttony, envy, grumpy, dopey and sleepy.   
.ad 
(MOTHER HITS HIM WITH A RULER.) 
.prip "RULER"   
.ch js  
Anger, avarice, envy, gluttony, lust, pride and sloth.  
.ch mo  
You must especially beware the trap of lust.
Never, ever give in!
You must purge yourselves of every carnal thought and vice. 
You must especially avoid thinking about men with firm buttocks 
and strong legs clad in Levis that cling to their every line and curve. 
.ch ns  
I think I'll be able to manage that.
.ch mo  
Our final recruit is late.  
While we're waiting, why don't we pray? 
Bow your heads. 
Colonel Hogan, would you say Grace? 
.ch ch  
Grace.  
(SHE HITS HIM WITH A RULER.)
Sorry.  
Dear Guh -- Dear Guh -- Big Guy, we, Your most obedient, repentant, 
boot-licking children ask of You Your indulgence, Your aid, 
and Your kindness.  
Look upon us with mercy while we attempt to escape our just punishment, 
overthrow Lucifer and grind our hobnailed boots into his crotch.
We undertake this endeavour in Your name, whether You like it or not.   
.ch mo  
This we ask in the name of Your son, the Nazarene carpenter,
who changed the water into wine and worked in the hot desert sun
while the sawdust clung to his body, drops of sweat glistening  
as they rolled down his manly chest, soaking his robe so that he
had to toss it aside and work in the nude, like some magnificent
jungle animal.  Amen.

What church did she belong to?  
.ch ns  
The Church of the Last Temptation of Christ.

We can't wait any longer.   
Let us start by introducing ourselves and the sins that 
condemned us to perdition eternal.  
.ch js  
John Steed. 
Anger, I'm afraid.  
My partner was killed in a particularly gruesome manner and I   
vowed to Avenger.   
.ch jd  
My name is Drake, John Drake.   
My sin was envy.
I was working the British Embassy when I met another spy.   
His name was Bond, Stocksen Bond, Double-Oh-Seven.  
I was immediately jealous.  
They'd given him a number and let him keep his name.
.ch ch  
I'm Colonel Robert Hogan.   
My downfall was gluttony.   
I always wanted more.   
.ch nb  
More money? 
.ch jd  
More fame?  
.ch ch  
More ratings.   
We should have asked Newkirk to wear the dress more often,  
but it would only have caused a family feud.
Anyway, I died and ended up here in the klink.  
.ch ns  
Napoleon Solo.  
I really don't know what sin I'm in for.
My theory is that heaven can't handle the competition.

or wet probing tongues intertwining.

Actually, I wouldn't mind.

All of us here desire one thing, and one thing only...

(ENTER MAXWELL SMART)   
.ch ms  
Maxwell Smart, Agent 86 of CONTROL.

You're late.
Like the rest of us, you are condemned to spend eternity facing 
damnation and demons who punish you with rawhide whips, again and   
again and again until you weep with pain.   
.ch ms  
And... loving it.

I didn't quite catch that.  
.ch ms  
I left the toilet seat up.  
.ch mo  
Very well.  
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to make your way to
the Gates of Hell and then escape.  
If you or any of your SOUL mates are caught or killed in action,
don't worry about it.   
You can only truly be killed by Satan's trident.
Good luck.
