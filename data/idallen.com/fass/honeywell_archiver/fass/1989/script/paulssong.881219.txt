I've made the last few changes, including the spelling of "discretion". 
I hope it's in a format that's relatively easy to merge with what you have.

BRUTUS: 
    (SPOKEN, IF NECESSARY, AS REX HARRISON) 
    Let's start with Original Sinning,  
    The very best place to start.   
    When we first saw Eden there were   
    Adam and Eve.   

    Their first two sins were:  


SEVERIAN:   
    Lust and Greed? 


BRUTUS: 
    Greed and Lust. 
    The first two sins are Greed and Lust.  
    Greed and Lust. 
    Greed Lust Pride Anger Envy Sloth Gluttony  


  (MR. MUSIC, PLEASE)   
    When you know what key it's in, 
    You can sing each Deadly Sin.   


  (STOMPING ON EACH KEY AND INDICATING  
  THAT THE SIN IS THAT OF THE KEY'S INHABITANT) 
    
    Dough, or cash, the sin of greed,   
    Ray, a man to lust about,   
    Me, myself, the sin of pride,   
    Fu--, an angry word to shout.   
    So much envy I can see, 
    Lazy is a word for sloth,   
    Tea, a drink with gluttony, 
    And that brings us back to dough, or greed or ...   


THE KEYS' INHABITANTS:  
  (REPEATED AS IN DOH MI MI, MI SOH SOH...) 
    Greed and Lust, Anger Pride, Envy Sloth, Gluttony   


SEVERIAN:   
  (SINGS VERSE AGAIN, OR JUST   
  THE "When You Know..." PART.  
  OR MAYBE THEY BOTH DO A REPRISE:  
  ONE STOMPS THE MAIN NOTE, AND 
  THE OTHER PLAYS THE MELODY THAT FOLLOWS.  
  OR MAYBE I'LL JUST LEAVE IT TO
  THE DIRECTOR'S DISCRETION)
