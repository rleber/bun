.ch ja  
It took them four hours to sort out who was who.
.ch ho  
Would you say that Satan was less than up front with you,   
Mr. Slobotnik?  
.ch ja  
Well he certainly wasn't what I thought.
.ch ho  
So Satan tricked you?   
.ch ja  
Well...yeah.
.ch ho  
Thank you Mr. Slobotnik.
Your Honour, my learned colleagues opposite have based their case   
on the following points: that my client first had motive for
this crime because Satan had tricked her.   
.ch ma  
Yes...  
.ch ho  
Yet Satan had also tricked Mr. Slobotnik, so Mr. Slobotnik  
also had motive.
Second, my learned colleagues attempted to show that my client  
had opportunity to commit this crime.   
.ch li  
Your Honour, we've been through this at length already! 

.ch ho  
Yet Mr. Slobotnik just admitted that he was also present at 
the time of the murder. 
Lastly the prosecution attempted to show that my client had 
means for the crime, in her possession of a lethal weapon.  
.ch st  
Your Honour, is it necessary to repeat all this?
.ch ho  
Yet Mr. Slobotnik has also stated that he also had access   
to a lethal weapon at the time of the murder.   
.xx LIBERTY~AND~STONE   
Get to the point!   
.ch ho  
The point, your Honour, is that Mr. Slobotnik could easily  
have been the perpetrator of this crime, which casts serious
doubt on the prosecution's case.
.ch ja  
Now wait a minute!  
.ch li  
Your Honour, Mr. Slobotnik was behind home plate when the   
murder occurred, not in left field. 
He had a baseball bat, not a trident, and he appears to enjoy   
his time in Hell, unlike some people!   
(GLARES AT LISA)
This is hardly consistent with Mr. Slobotnik being the murderer.
We submit that no doubt has been established.   
.ch st  
(ASIDE) 
We also submit that the defense attorney be shot for the
poor calibre of his performance.
.ch ma  
What was that, Ms. Stone?   
.ch st  
Nothing, your Honour.   
.ch ma  

You said something, I saw you whispering.   
Please state your comments to the court.
.ch st  
(RESIGNED)  
We also submit that the defense attorney be shot, for the   
poor calibre of his performance.
.ch ma  
Oh. 
So be it.   
.ad 
(BAILIFF SHOOTS HOPE.)  
.ch ma  
Oh dear.
I guess Mr. Hope has no further questions.  
You may retire, Mr. Slobotnik.  
.ch ba  
But he's at the peak of his career! 
.ad 
(JAKE EXITS)
.ch lg  
Great!  
So what do I do now?
.ch st  
Get a new lawyer.   
.ch lg  
Where?  
.ch ma  
The court will appoint a new solicitor for you. 
Anyone here know anything about soliciting? 
.ch pa  
I watched a few episodes of Perry Mason once.   
.ch ma  
Good enough!
Court appoints Pam Assonic as counsel for the defense.  
.ch lg  
Hey, don't I get a say in this? 
.ch ma  
No. 
Now be quiet or I'll have to hold you in confetti of court. 
.ad 
(BAILIFF BRANDISHES A BAG OF CONFETTI.  
VARIOUS CLEANING AND THEATRE PERSONNEL HAVE HEART ATTACKS.) 
.ch ma  
Ms. Assonic, any opening remarks?   
.ch pa  
Yes, your Honour.   
I'd like to say that I'm honoured to have been asked to assist  






in this historic case, and I would like to state that even though   
my client was found at the scene of the crime, covered in gore, 
and despite her untrustworthy nature, her threats against Satan,
and her clear motive... 
(PAUSE. 
THEN TO LISA)   
Are you sure you don't want to change your plea?
.ch lg  
But I'm innocent!   
.ch pa  
Oh come on, you've heard the testimony. 
The only thing that hasn't been established is that you had 
possession of the murder weapon at the time of the murder.  
.ch li  
We can prove that!  
.ch st  
Call Mr. J. Jones to the stand. 
.ch ma  
Haul in J. Jones.   
.ad 
(BAILIFF DRAGS JUGHEAD IN BY THE SCRUFF OF HIS NECK.)   
.ch li  
Now Mr. Jones, you were at the baseball game, were you not? 
.ch pa  
Objection!  
This witness hasn't been qualified. 
.ch ma  
This witness isn't qualified, but that's beside the point.  
.ch pa  
No your Honour, he hasn't given his name, address, or   
occupation for the record.  
.ch ma  
Counselor, if you want his name and phone number, get it on 
your own time, and keep your social life out of the courtroom.  
Mr. Liberty, you may precis.
.ch li  









Very well, to sum up, Mr. Jones has established that the accused
had the means, to wit the murder weapon, in her possession  
at the time of the crime.   
.ch jj  
I did?  
.ch li  
Yes.
Didn't you just tell us that...
