.ch ho  
Objection!  
Prosecution is leading the witness. 
.ch lo  
Party Pooper!   
.ch ma  
I'm confused.   
Isn't the man   
.ul 
supposed
to lead?
.ch ho  
But that's sexist, your Honour. 
.ch ma  
Overruled.  
.ch li  
So Satan tricked Ms Griement in their first meeting?
.ch lo  
Yes, he always did enjoy acquiring souls through elocutionary agreements.   
.ch pa  
What?   
.ch ba  
Elocutionary agreements...fancy word games, 
like when people interpret figures of speech literally. 
.ch pa  
I know that!
How do you spell it?
.ch ba  
I. T.   
.ch pa  
Cut it out.

.ch li  
And did Ms. Griement appreciate Satan's little joke?
.ch lo  
No. 
She said she was mad as Hell and wasn't going to take it any more.  
.ch li  
Thank you, Mrs Lott.
Your Honour, as this witness has clearly shown, Ms Griement obviously   
had a motive to dispatch the Supreme Sleazy Slumlord.   
.ch ho  
(JUMPING IN QUICKLY BEFORE HE IS BROWBEATEN)
Now Mrs. ELIZA, you are also a slumlord--   
.ch lo  
I'm 
.ul 
not 
a slumlord. 
I'm a Student Domicile Optimization Engineer.   
.ch ho  
Very well.  
As a Student Domicile Optimization Engineer, you have encountered   
many potential tenants, have you not?   
.ch lo  
(LEERY) 
Yes.
.ch ho  
And where you have more applicants than vacancies, you must choose  
who will become the new tenant, must you not??  
.ch lo  
Yes.
.ch ho  
(RHETORICALLY)  
And how do you do this? 
.ch lo  
Well, first I see who can pay the rather exorbitant rent... 
.ch ho  
(CONTINUES WITHOUT HEARING A WORD ELIZA SAYS)   
Of course, you make snap decisions, do you not, Mrs Lott... 
.ch lo  
Then I find out what indignations they're willing to suffer to get the  
apartment...
.ch ho  
In other words, ten 
seconds of meaningless conversation, and boom, it's tenant or bum...
.ch lo  
Finally I see how many twisted perverted lurid sexual acts they can perform.
.ch ho  
In short you... 
(DOUBLE TAKE)   
...perform twisted perverted sexual acts??  
You devil, you harlot, you painted Jezebel. 
I have only one thing to say to someone of your ilk...  
.ch rp  
Any vacancies?  
.ch li  
I take it your cross-examination is finished?   
.ch ma  
Very well, Mrs Lott, you are misdissed...dismissed. 
.ad 
(ELIZA AND REPORTER LEAVE, TALKING TO EACH OTHER)   
.ch ho  
Your Honour, bail for my client has not been set, and she is currently  
in captivity in a cell that makes Mrs Eliza's place look like the   
Taj Mahal.  
.ch st  
Your Honour, prosecution requests that bail be denied for this fiery,   
deranged, hot-headed murderess. 
.ch ma  
What grounds do you have to flake maiming accusations?  
.ch li  
We have a witness who will show that the accused cannot be  
trusted to comply with the terms of her bail agreement. 
.ch ma  
Very well, summon your witness. 
.ch st  
Summon Natasha Badanov to the stand.
.ch ba
