SCHULZ: 
When I sit down at my stand 
And I take my pen in hand   
I close my eyes and soon I find 
A Peanut Gall'ry in my mind

Where the children laugh
And the children play,  
And they sing a song all day-ay-ay-ay.

SCHROEDER:  
My name is Schroeder.  I play piano.
I played Beethoven when I was two.  
When I get older, I'll spike my hair green. 
(Play) Ramones and Motley Crue.

SCHULZ: 
Comic strips I draw each day
Showcase a moral play.  
Charlie Brown will never win
The kind of dough Snoopy rakes in.

Yet the children laugh, 
And the children play,  
And they sing a song all day-ay-ay.

LUCY:   
My name is Lucy.  When we get married   
We'll have a mansion in Malibu. 
I'm gonna get me some alimony.  
That's what I'm gonna do.

SCHULZ: 
Living in a world that I made up blind. 
Happiness is warm puppies and residuals signed. 
See all the little Peanuts. 
See how they prosper me in the bank vaults

All right team, listen up...

All right team, listen up.  
We have a brand new season ahead of us. 
We have to concentrate and give this season everything we've got.   
Baseball isn't just a game; it's a metaphor for life.   
You run around in circles, you lose your edge when you get older,   
and when it's all done, you get sent to the showers.

What's the point?   
We've never won a baseball game and we're never

going   
to win a baseball game.

Yeah, what are we gonna do -- practise our losing?

Can't help you, Chuck.

You're the world's greatest catcher!

That's my point.
I always win.   
Your team always loses. 
.ch cs  
But this time I'm going to do something new.
.ch ja  
You're gonna let them   
.ul 
win?
.ch cs  
Better than that.   
I'm trying to think of a way to have the gang play an important game,   
build up the excitement, and
.ul 
then
lose.   
.ch ja  
Yeah Chuck, that's tons better than winning.
Face it, guy, you either let them win one at long last, or  
you're stuck with the same old thing as always. 
.ch cs  
I don't buy that.   
There's got to be a new angle.  
Boy, I'd give

anything
for a new plotline.

This is me going now...

What do you want, hellspawn?

I want your...baseball team.
.xx SHULZ~AND~JAKE  
Hunh?   
.ch ms  
I've got an upstart bit of ectoplasm
downstairs who's getting on my nerves.  
Doesn't like the food, doesn't like the weather, doesn't like third 
degree burns, it's just bitch, bitch, bitch.
So I said to it, I'll play you a baseball game, my team versus yours.   
If you win, you're outta here.  
If  
.ul 
I   
win...if
.ul 
I   
win...well, it's not entirely clear that anyone gains or loses  
anything if 
.ul 
I   
win, but that's not the point.  
.ch ja  
What
.ul 
is  
the point?  
.ch ms  
The point is, I want this snotty little tart to be represented by   
the worst team in all baseball history.

the line between fantasy and reality, but...

You, Shermy, what do you want most in life?

A personality!

Frieda? 
.ch fr  
Something to talk about other than my naturally curly hair! 
.ch ms  
Violet? 
.ch vi  
I'd like Lucy to wither up and die so I can be the new  
fussbudget. 
I'm just as mean and nasty and spiteful 
as she is, but she gets all the fun.
(SINGSONG)  
Lucy gets to jerk away the football.
Lucy gets to psychoanalyze Charlie Brown.   
Lucy gets to lean on the piano and say pig-ignorant things  
to Schroeder.   
.ch cs  
Who does that Satan think he is, messing with my strip?

I'm 
in charge here.

"And there were in the city of Mudville nine players abiding in the 
field; the score stood two to four, with but one inning left that night.
Blakey was safe at second, and Flynn a-huggin' third.   
And, lo, Casey, mighty Casey came upon them advancing to the bat: and   
they were sore afraid.  
And the umpire said unto them: 'Strike one,' and the crowd did shout,   
'Kill him! Kill the ump!' 'til Casey did raise his hand.
'Fear not,' said Casey; 'Strike two,' said the ump, and behold, tidings 
of great 'Fraud' issued from the throats of all the people. 
For unto them wast born such a blow this day in the city of Mudville
which is -- Christ! the Mighty Casey has struck out."

And you can control the little buggers from out here.   
But we can still talk.

I don't have to listen.

Why am I getting all these negative vibes?

This is good vs. evil!

Actually, it's mediocre vs. evil.   
.ch ms  
We're talking a single lousy ballgame here. 
They come to Inquisition Stadium, they play, they lose, they
go home.
I'll pick 'em up right after the morning edition and have them  
back in time for the afternoons.
.ch cs  
(FINGERS IN EARS)   
I'm not listening.

Tell you what, for a limited time only, here's my offer.
You lend me the team, and I give you a whole raft of new plotlines. 
.ch cs  
No!

Don't you want to be inspired again?
How many times can you have Peppermint Patty fall asleep in school?

Six times a week and once in colour.

Talk about combing a desert...

What's the matter, Violet?  
Why don't you put on your glove?

What if a bug crawled in during the night?  
Every day I worry whether there's a bug inside.

How far out would you say centre field is?

About a hundred yards.

I stand out there with this damned naturally curly hair that went out   
of style twenty years ago and always looked like a Brillo pad anyway,   
and what kind of fulfillment is there in that?

And what about me?  
What about good ol' Shermy? 
I am so

We could have been those cute kids in Joanie Caucus's old

I was going to be the little chauvinist pig...

Wow, I haven't seen Frieda in ages. 
How come you don't do the old characters like Frieda or Pig-pen any 
more?   
.ch cs  
Well, they were kind of one-joke characters...  
.ch ja  
Even one joke isn't that bad a batting average, Chuck.  
You know what I mean?   
.ch cs  
Are you saying I've lost it?
.ch ja  
I'm just saying that you shouldn't turn down inspiration
when it's being offered.
