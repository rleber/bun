.ch st  
So, you are telling us that Ms. Griement was
plotting to overthrow Satan and destroy his Kingdom, despite
his having given her a 9000 sq ft condo with full recreational facilities.  
.ch na  
Yes, darlink.   
.ch st  
Your worship, we the prosecution put it to you that these   
are not the actions of a trustworthy citizen.   
I would not trust this person, my partner would not trust this person, and the  
worthy visitors to our court (POINTS TO AUDIENCE) would 
not trust this person.  
.ad 
(AT THIS POINT, ROSE BUSH STANDS.   
SHE HAS BEEN SITTING IN THE AUDIENCE, DISGUISED AS A BUSH.) 
.ch rb  
I don't trust that woman.   
No one really has hair that colour. 
.ch ho  
Objection!  
That woman's obviously a plant. 
(STARTS TO RIFLE THROUGH HIS NOTES) 
.ch st  
The facts in this case clearly show that Satan helped and favoured  
this person, and she attempted to betray him.   
Even my worthy colleague opposite must agree that these are not the actions 
of a trustworthy individual.
Right?  
.ch ho  
(LOOKING UP FROM NOTES) 
Right!...Well er... normally right...but in this case...
.ch st  
There you have it, your Honour, do you need to hear more?   
.ch jm  
Very well, bail is denied.  
.ch ho  
But your Honour, don't I get a chance-- 
.ch jm  
No! 
Now sit down and be quiet or I'll have the bailiff reject you.  
Ms. Badanov, you may step down. 
.ch lg  
Why is this taking so long? 
.ch ho  
The duty of a judge is to administer justice, but his practice  
is to delay it. 
.ch lg  
Well can't he delay any faster? 
.ch ho  
Time is precious, but truth is more precious than time. 
.ch lg  
So far we haven't seen any truth.   
.ch ho  
Law is a strange thing. 
It makes a man swear to tell the  truth, and every time he shows some sign  
of doing so, some lawyer objects.   
.ch lg  
Enough with the epigrams.   
Do your job or I'll do a job on you!
.ch re  
If you give us an exclusive...  
.ch lg  
Listen greaseball, why should I trust you?  
.ch re  
Hey lady, I'm a reputable member of the Enquirer staff, and I even  
stole the prosecution's notes for you.

Ah yes, about to start in on another witness.

.ch li  
Jake Slobotnik to the stand.
.ad 
(JAKE ENTERS AND TAKES THE STAND.)  
.ch li  
Mr. Slobotnik, you have information vital to this tragic
case, do you not?   
.ch ja  
No. 
.ch li  
Well then, you have news of the hideous conspiracy that took
the very breath of life of the Lord and Master of Toxic Waste Dumps.
.ch ja  
No. 
.ch li  
Then you have secret data pertaining to the despicable and  
corrupt nature of the accused and can tell the court why she
committed this accursed, beastly, contemptible, despicable, erinaceous, 
frightful, heinous, ignominious, loathsome, monstrous, nasty,   
outrageous, sordid, terrible,   
vile, wretched... er, wretched...   
.ch st  
Crime.  
.ch li  
Crime!  
.ch ja  
No. 
But I do know how they get the caramel in the Caramilk bar. 
.ch jm  
Really! 
How do they do that?
I've always wondered.   
.ch li  
Why are you here?   
.ch ja  
To tell how the baseball game got started.  
.ch li  
Oh. 
How did the baseball game get started?  
.ch ja  
Satan made a deal with Ms. Griement where he would let her  
go free, if her team could beat his in a baseball game. 
.ch li  
And she agreed. 
.ch ja  
Yes.
Satan even insisted on getting her the world's most famous team 
on her side.
