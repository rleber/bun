.ch ja  
It took them four hours to sort out who was who.
.ch ho  
Would you say that Satan was less than up front with you,   
Mr. Slobotnik?  
.ch ja  
Well he certainly wasn't what I thought.
.ch ho  
So Satan tricked you?   
.ch ja  
Well...yeah.
.ch ho  
Thank you Mr. Slobotnik.
Your Honour, my learned colleagues opposite have based their case   
on the following points: that my client first had motive for
this crime because Satan had tricked her.   
.ch lg  
Way to go, bright boy.  
.ch ma  

Yes...  
.ch ho  
Yet Satan had also tricked Mr. Slobotnik, so Mr. Slobotnik  
also had motive.
.ch lg  
Wait, that's good.  
.ch ho  
Second, my learned colleagues attempted to show that my client  
had opportunity to commit this crime.   
.ch li  
Your Honour, we've been through this at length already! 
.ch ho  
Yet Mr. Slobotnik just admitted that he was also present at 
the time of the murder. 
Lastly the prosecution attempted to show that my client had 
means for the crime, in her possession of a lethal weapon.  
.ch st  
Your Honour, is it necessary to repeat all this?
.ch lg  
Let the man speak.  
.ch ho  
Yet Mr. Slobotnik has also stated that he also had access   
to a lethal weapon at the time of the murder.   
.xx LIBERTY~AND~STONE   
Get to the point!   
.ch ho  
The point, your Honour, is that Mr. Slobotnik could easily  
have been the perpetrator of this crime, which casts serious
doubt on the prosecution's case.

Knock 'em dead, kid!

There's owls in the court?

Yes, I'll take the case.
I've been a court recorder for fifteen years, and I've watched  
you bozos make a mockery of the law.
Justice may be blind, but she is not stupid.
.ch ma  
Ms. Assonic, any opening remarks?   
.ch pa  
Yes, your Honour.   
I would like to state that even though  
my client was found at the scene of the crime, covered in gore, 
and despite her untrustworthy nature, her threats against Satan,
and her clear motive...

Are you sure you don't want to change your plea?
.ch lg  
But I'm innocent!   
.ch pa  
Oh, come on, you've heard the testimony.
The only thing that hasn't been established is that you had 
possession of the crime weapon at the time of the crime.
.ch li  
We can prove that, too!

Oh, dear.

How can I swear to tell the truth until I hear the questions?

Now Mr. Vial, you were at the baseball game, were you not?  
.ch pa  
Objection!  
This witness hasn't been qualified. 
.ch ma  
This witness isn't qualified, but that's beside the point.  
.ch pa  
No, your Honour, he hasn't given his name, address, or  
occupation for the record.  
.ch st  
If you want his name and phone number, get it on
your own time, and keep your social life out of the courtroom.  
.ch ma  
Objection overruled.
Mr. Liberty, you may precis.
.ch li  
Very well, to sum up, Mr. Vial has established that the accused 
had the means, to wit the murder weapon, in her possession  
at the time of the crime.   
.ch jj  
I did?  
.ch li  
Yes.
Didn't you just tell us that...
