Oh, no! 
He brought the charter with the picture of a garter.
.ch li  
Th charter with the garter? 
.ch ab  
It's a standard legal charter but the watermark's a garter. 
.ch li  
So what?
The paper with the taper is still the document of damning.  
.ch ab  
No, now the charter with the garter is the document of damning  
while the paper with the taper is the piece with the lease. 
.ch sa  
I'm waiting.
.ch li  
The charter with the garter?
.ch ab  
Is the document of damning. 
.ch li  
Uh-huh. 
The charter with the garter is the document of damning  
while the letter that is wetter is the paper with the taper.
.ch ab  
No! 
.ch sa  
Sign one.   
.ch li  
But the paper with the taper is the piece with the lease!

(LISA SIGNS ONE)
.prip "PEN" 
.ch ow  
Which one did you get?  
.ch li  
The lease!  
.ch sa  
All signed? 
Look at your lease  
carefully. You'll see that you, Lisa,   
are the one who is renting. 
In technical terms, the lessee. 
.ch li  
According to this, Mrs. Eliza is the one who's leasing, or the lessor.  
.ch sa  
Correct.
So Lisa is the lessee and Eliza is the lessor.  
.ch li  
So what?
You lost.   
.ch sa  
My company, Lucifer Unlimited,  
owns the private corporation which owns Mrs. Eliza. 
This lease means that Lucifer has Eliza on a leash. 
.ch li  
You own her?
.ch sa  
It's simple, dear.  
Though you, Lisa, are the lessee and Eliza is the lessor,   
in the other leasing Lucifer leases to Eliza,   
Eliza is the lesser of the lessors, 
and so you, Lisa, are the lesser on two levels. 
Now check the address on that condo.
.ch li  
Oh, Hell.   
.ch sa  
Exactly.
I always win.
