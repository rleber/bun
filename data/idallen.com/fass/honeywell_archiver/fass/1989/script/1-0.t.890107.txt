(FOR THE PRE-SET, THE MAIN DRAPE IS CLOSED AND THE LIFT, EMPTY AND FENCED   
OFF, IS AT THE LEVEL OF THE ORCHESTRA FLOOR.
FRANKLY, EXCEPT FOR THE DEMON HORNS ON THE USHERS, THE WHOLE THING  
LOOKS PRETTY ORDINARY.)

(HOUSE LIGHTS GO DOWN TO SIGNAL THE START OF THE SHOW, AND A
COMPANIONABLE-BUT-NOT-THEATRICAL LIGHT COMES UP ON THE STAGE IN FRONT   
OF THE CURTAIN, WHERE UNDERSTUDY A AND UNDERSTUDY 1 ENTER AND ADDRESS   
THE AUDIENCE DIRECTLY.) 
.ch ua  
Good evening!   
.ch u1  
Welcome to FASS 1989!   
.ch ua  
To ensure the comfort and safety of the patrons seated around you,  
there is no smoking in the theatre auditorium, no photography,  
no recording and no food or drink allowed.  
.ch u1  
In case of an emergency, we ask you to note the location of 
the exit nearest you.   
.ad 
(UNDERSTUDY A MAKES LIKE A FLIGHT ATTENDANT DURING THE SAFETY LECTURE.) 
.ex 
There are four exits from the centre and sides of   
the balcony, and three exits in front of each wing. 
In the unlikely event of comedy de-pressurization, a mask will  
drop down from the compartment above your seat. 
.ad 
(A PAIR OF  
.prop "BOFFER GLASSES"  
DROPS DOWN FROM THE COMPARTMENT ABOVE   
UNDERSTUDY A, WHO PUTS THEM ON.)
.ex 
Place it securely on your head and laugh normally.  
Thank you and have a pleasant night.
.ad 
(PAUSE. SMILE. DIALOGUE THROUGH GRITTED TEETH.) 
.ex 
.ch ua  
I knew it.  
.ch u1  
What?   
.ch ua  
They're still not ready.
.ch u1  
How can you tell?   
.ch ua  
The lights haven't gone down yet.   
We're still lit up like the 4th of July.
.ch u1  
You mean the 1st of July.   
.ch ua  
Free Trade. 
.ch u1  
(PAUSE) 
Kerry?  
Ker-ry? 
.ad 
(THE BOOTH WINDOW OPENS AND KERRY THE STAGE MANAGER STICKS HER HEAD 
OUT THE OPENING TO REPLY.)  
.ch ke  
Guys, we're running a little late. Cover!   
.ch u1  
Right.  
That's Kerry, the stage manager.
.ad 
(KERRY DUCKS BACK INTO THE BOOTH.)  
.ex 
Everybody say "hi" to Kerry.
.ch ua  
Up above the balcony is Ken, the follow-spot operator.  
Say "hi" to Ken.
.ld 
(KEN THE FOLLOW-SPOT OPERATOR WAGGLES THE SPOTLIGHT.)   
.ex 
(SOTTO VOCE)
Have Peter make an announcement.
.ch u1  
Ladies and Gentlemen, let's have a round of applause
for Peter, the House Manager.   
.ad 
(PETER IS INDUCED TO GO ONSTAGE.)   
.ch ph  
There is a car with its lights on.  
.ch u1  
Backstage, a disciplined crew of devoted technicians are smoothly   
putting into place the last sets and special effects.   
.ad 
(MAIN DRAPE COMES UP TO REVEAL THE NAKED STAGE, WITH TECHIES RUNNING
HITHER AND YON, 
A FEW ACTORS LIMBERING UP,  
THE BAND HAVING A PARTY IN THE BACK CORNER, AND A HEAP OF   
SET PIECES THAT WILL BECOME THE COURTROOM SCENE DOWNSTAGE.  
DURING THE FOLLOWING DIALOGUE TECHIES WILL SET THE LIFT WITH THE
COURTROOM FURNISHINGS.) 
.ch ua  
Reminds me of my old ant farm... or lemmings... 
.ch u1  
Reminds me of a macroscopic model of the surface of a pure  
substance at the triple point:  
some molecules firmly fixed in place,   
some flying about madly,
and some just moving about randomly in an elegant illustration  
of Brownian motion in a liquid. 
A good hot cup of tea, for example. 
.ad 
(   
.prop "A GOOD HOT CUP OF TEA"   
DESCENDS, MUCH LIKE THE BOFFER GLASSES.)
.ch ua  
Everybody wave to the band. 
.ch u1  
As our veteran audience members know, we write FASS ourselves.  
Hold your applause. 
.ch ua  
Our theme is chosen after elaborate polling of our company and fans,
and statistical analysis of the results.
This year, in response to your  
many thoughtful cards and letters, FASS goes to hell.   
.ch u1  
What! What did you say? 
.ch ua  
I said, FASS goes to hell.  
.ch u1  
You can't say   
.ul 
that
onstage!
.ch ua  
What? "Hell?"   
.ch u1  
Stop that!  
We can't use that sort of language. 
This is a university campus.
.ch ua  
What's that got to do with it?  
.ch u1  
What if someone reports us to the principal?
.ch ua  
At university, we don't have a principal, we have a president.  
And our president has no principles at all. 
.ch u1  
Is that right?  
.ch ua  
Exactly.
.ch u1  
As you can see, the crew is almost ready,   
the band is hot and the actors are limbering up backstage.  
All that remains is to get the audience warmed up so you can
keep up with our blinding comic pace.   
.ch ua  
So we've selected your number.

Row, row, row your boat

A NARROW SPOT PICKS UP THE FACE OF SATAN, CONTORTED WITH PAIN.  
DRAMATIC PAUSE. 
THE SPOT WIDENS, REVEALING THAT HIS SATANIC MAJESTY HAS BEEN FATALLY
SKEWERED WITH HIS OWN   
.prop "DEVILISHLY-LARGE TRIDENT."   
HIS LORDSHIP FALLS, STILL CAPTURED IN A POOL OF LIGHT.
