        Tf is a text formatting program that allows  you  to
type  in  text  (in  the  case  of FASS, your scene) without
regard to the final format it will have.  Lines  don't  have
to  line  up  nicely, you simply insert some TF commands and
some special formatting commands, called  macros,  into  the
scene  as  you  type  it into the computer.  When you let TF
process your text, it will use the  formatting  commands  to
format the scene.(1)


        Tf takes care of things like margins, page  headings
and  footings,  and  page numbering.  The macros let you use
abbreviations for character names, instead of having to type
in the full character name for each line of dialogue.  Songs
get nice boxes of asterisks around the titles.  




                 _M_a_c_r_o_s _a_n_d _F_o_r_m_a_t _C_o_m_m_a_n_d_s   








        The TF formatting commands and macros that you  will



need  to  use  are  lines  of  text that start with a period
(".").  The formatting command lines  are  interspersed  (in
the  right  places)  with  your scene text.  (See the Sample
Scene at the end of this document for an  idea  of  how  the
formatting commands and text look together.)


        Here are some examples of formatting commands:  


    .so 83macr.t
    .bs 1 1 "A Title for Act 1 Scene 1" 
    .na mm MARTHA~AND~THE~MUFFINS MARTHA
    .ch mm  


Each command starts right at the beginning of the  line;  no
spaces  or  tabs are allowed.  In fact, TF thinks that every
line starting with a period ought to be a command  line.   A
period  at the beginning of a line tells TF that the line is
a TF command, and it will try to  find  and  use  a  command
named by the letters following the period.

                           - 2 -


        If  it  can't  identify the characters following the
period, TF complains and just treats  the  line  as  regular
text  to  be  printed.   You don't have to worry about lines
that start with "..."; TF treats "..." as regular text to be
printed.


        Once TF recognizes the name of a formatting command,
it looks at the rest of the command line.  It takes the text
it  finds  on  the  command  line, splits it up delimited by
spaces, and passes the split-up line to the formatting  com-
mand.  For example, the command line


    .na mm MARTHA~AND~THE~MUFFINS MARTHA


is  known as the ".na" macro, and after TF splits it, it has
three  _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:    "mm",   "MARTHA~AND~THE~MUFFINS",   and  
"MARTHA".   Many TF formatting commands need one or more ar-
guments, as will be seen.   




                 _D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n _o_f _T_F _C_o_m_m_a_n_d_s   








        This is a detailed description of  the  TF  commands
and  macros  you need to format a scene.  The first few com-
mands are always used at the beginning of a scene; they  are
given in order. 



        The macros are shown with typical arguments; replace
the arguments with your own,  as  required.   A  summary  of
these  commands  and macros appears at the end of this docu-
ment.   


.so 83macr.t
    Get the macros.  This must be the first line of a scene.
    It inserts the main macro file of macro definitions  and
    makes  sure  that  a consistent environment is set up in
    terms of line length, justification, etc.  The  argument
    file name must be "83macr.t".   


            The  file  named  in  this  command  must be ac-
    cessible before you use TF; see the section on using  TF
    for details on finding the file.


.bs 1 1 "This is the scene title"   
    Begin a scene.  This must be the second line of a scene.
    It prints the title of the scene and sets a line counter
    to zero.

                           - 3 -


            The  first  argument  is  the number of the act.
    The second argument is the scene designator.  Both argu-
    ments  may  be numbers or letters or both.  For instance



    intermission vignettes could have the act designator  of
    "Int".   The  last  argument  is the title of the scene.
    Keep the title less than about 50 characters in  length,
    and remember to put double quotes around it.


.na abbrev FULL~NAME~OF~CHARACTER SHORT~NAME
    Define an abbreviation.  A set of several of these lines
    (one  for  each  character in the scene) comes after the
    ".bs" macro.


            This identifies to TF a character name abbrevia-
    tion, "abbrev", for the name of your character.  The ab-
    breviation must be different for each character  in  the
    scene.   The  abbreviation  can be any string of 1 to 10
    letters or digits (or any combination) that you wish  to
    use  in  the  ".ch"  macro to indicate dialogue for that
    character.  You'll probably want to keep  the  abbrevia-
    tion  short;  you'll  be typing it for every character's
    speech. 


            The FULL~NAME~OF~CHARACTER is the full  name  of
    the  character.  It will appear, in bold-face print, the
    first time the character is used in a scene.  After this
    first  appearance,  the shorter SHORT~NAME will be used.







    Join each word in each name with tildes, so  that  there
    are  no  blanks  in  the name; do not use double quotes.
    The tildes will vanish on output.  Both the full and the
    short  names  should be UPPER CASE, to set them off from
    the rest of the text.   


.ch abbrev  
    Character "abbrev" speaks.  This sort of line precedes a
    speech by a character.  


            The "abbrev" is the same as the  first  argument
    to  the  ".na"  macro that corresponds to the character.
    For example, to define and use names for Glinda the Good
    Witch and The Wizard of Oz: 


        .so 83macr.t
        .bs 1 5 "Sample Scene"  
        .na ggw GLINDA~THE~GOOD~WITCH GLINDA
        .na wiz THE~WIZARD~OF~OZ WIZARD 
        .ch ggw 
        This is said by Glinda. 
        .ch wiz 
        This is said by the Wizard. 
        .ch ggw 
        This is said by Glinda.

                           - 4 -


    Note  that  the  abbreviation  you  choose is up to you.
    Keep it less than about ten characters. 


.es 




    End  a  scene.   This  must be the LAST line of a scene.
    Please remember it! 




_T_a_l_k_i_n_g _i_n _U_n_i_s_o_n 




In some cases, you may want to have two characters  talk  in
unison,  or  you  may  have a single-use character who isn't
really worth the bother of using the ".na" macro  to  create
an  abbreviation.   You can specify any name to be used just
like the regular character macro would use it by doing: 


    .xx CHARACTER1~&~CHARACTER2 
    This text is said by both characters.   
    .xx PARLOUR~MAID
    The Parlour Maid only has one speech
    and isn't worth an abbreviation.
    .xx ALL 
    Everyone says this speech.  




        The  ".xx" macro will format the following speech by
the character(s) in the same way as if you  had  used  ".na"
and  ".ch".   It  is  the  only way to have two names appear
heading one speech.  As with the ".na" macro, keep the names
all  UPPER CASE.  Make sure you use tildes to join the words
together; don't use quotes! 




_E_n_t_e_r_i_n_g _S_o_n_g_s




Songs start with a ".sb" macro, and have ".ve" macros inter-






spersed to keep the verses tidy.  If different verses of the
song are to be sung by different characters, the  ".sl"  and
".ss"  macros  can  be used to separate one character's part
from another's. 


    .sb "I'm Dreaming of a White Lemming"  "White Christmas"
    I'm dreaming of a white 
    Lemming.
    Just like the mice I used to know   
    .ve 5   
    .sl ggw 
    When the days seem  
    chilly and bright.  
    May all your shirt collars  






F.A.S.S. 1983          Entering Songs         87/12/24 15:35
.   




                           - 5 -


    Be white.   
    .ch ggw 
    Did you like my song, Wiz?  


The  ".sl"  macro is used in songs exactly the way the ".ch"
macro is used in ordinary dialogue; its argument (in our ex-
ample,  "ggw")  is an abbreviation defined by a ".na" macro.
The ".ss" macro is  used  if  two  or  more  characters  are
singing  a  verse.  It is similar to the ".xx" macro used in
dialogue, and takes the same argument, i.e., the name  of  a
character.  


        If the first verse of a song gets separated from its
title when you see the formatted output, see a TF expert and

have a ".ne" command added in front of the song.


_T_h_e _S_o_n_g _M_a_c_r_o_s   




.sb "Our Song Title" "The REAL Song Title"  
    This  sets  the  titles in a nice box of asterisks, with
    our song title first, and the real song title  following
    the  words  "to the tune of:".  Both titles must be less
    than 48 characters long.  Make sure that each  title  is
    enclosed in a set of double quotes. 


.ve 4   
    This is needed to make sure that a song is not split  in
    the  middle  of  a verse.  Replace the number "4" by the
    number of lines up to the next  ".ve"  or  ".se".   This
    will  have  TF  start  a  new  page  if it can't fit the
    specified number of lines onto the current page;  hence,
    the  verse  will be kept together and will start the new
    page.  Use  ".ve <nn>"  to  preceed  and  separate  each
    verse.

        Stage  directions and technical directions for sound
and light must be kept distinct.  This should help our over-














worked technical staff and at the same time make our authors
conscious about the  technical  demands  they  are  placing.
These directions are very important!


        All stage, light, sound, and music directions should
be typed in all in UPPER CASE,  surrounded  by  one  set  of
parentheses "()".  Keeping all non-spoken text in the script
in UPPER CASE makes it easier for actors to  skip  over  it.

                           - 6 -


Each  different  type  of  direction  is preceded by its own
macro.  


        Any sound which must be produced over the P.A. sound
system  in  the  Theatre must be identified by preceding the
direction by a ".sd" macro.  Noises made by  the  actors  or
crew  on  stage  without the use of the sound system are _n_o_t  
sound directions,  but  are  ACTOR  directions  (use ".ad").
Sounds   to  be  made  by  the  band  are  music  directions
(use ".md").


        Any lighting changes (including lights up and lights
down at the beginning and end of your scene) must start with
the ".ld" macro.










        Actor (stage) directions must start with  the  ".ad"
macro.  


        Here  are some sample sound, light, and actor direc-
tions:  


    .ld 
    (THIS IS AN UPPER-CASE LIGHTING-DIRECTION   
    WHICH MAY COVER SEVERAL LINES.  
    IT IS SURROUNDED BY PARENTHESES.)   
    .sd 
    (THIS IS A SOUND-DIRECTION, USING THE SAME FORMAT.) 
    .ad 
    (THIS IS AN ACTOR-DIRECTION,
    FOR ACTION ON STAGE, USING THE SAME FORMAT.)
    .ch ggw 
    There, I said so.   




        For simple directions to a specific actor, place the
direction in parentheses in the actor's speech.   Keep  such
directions upper case.  


Example:


    .ch wiz 
    (MOVES LEFT) I'm the Wizard around here! (COUGHS)   
    Where's Dave?  (SITS DOWN)  
    .ch ggw 
    (SCREAMING DELERIOUSLY:) Don't sit on that! 
    .ad 
    (HUGE EXPLOSION.)   


Note  that  only directions to the one _s_p_e_a_k_i_n_g actor should
be placed in-line.  General directions to other actors or to
more than one actor must use ".ad". 








F.A.S.S. 1983  Technical and Stage Directions 87/12/24 15:35
.   







                           - 7 -


        Light  and  sound  cues  should really be set off by
their  macros,  no  matter  how  trivial.   This  will  mean
splitting some speeches around these directons: 


    .ch ggw 
    (MOVES TO TELEPHONE) I wonder what will happen next.
    .sd 
    (TELEPHONE RINGS)   
    .ex 
    I might have known.  (ANSWERS PHONE) Hello? 
    .ch wiz 
    (OVER P.A. SYSTEM:) Hello!  It's me.


Note that another ".ch ggw" is not necessary after the sound
direction.   We use the ".ex" macro to indicate that the ac-
tor keeps talking.  The actor will skip the sound  direction
and  continue  the dialogue afterward.  An exception to this
rule may occur if the direction is very long, in which  case
you  should  repeat the character macro (e.g. ".ch ggw") in-
stead of using the ".ex".   


        Description of  items  on  stage,  such  as  at  the
beginning  of  a scene, is considered an Actor Direction, to
be started by the ".ad" macro.  




_P_r_o_p_s 




The ".prop" and ".prip" macros are used to keep track of the
props  required  in a scene.  When a prop is explicitly men-
