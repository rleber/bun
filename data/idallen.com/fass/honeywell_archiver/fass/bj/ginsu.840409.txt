Sweetheart, I'm afraid that I've got ring around the collar.

.ch wi  
No!  (SHE GRABS SHIRT)  It's true!  Oh, lord help me, it's true!
(SHE BEGINS TO WEEP)  Where did I go wrong?  Why didn't I see it coming?
The man came to me in the laundromat, he said, "I'll give you fifty dollars 
for that shirt," but no, I didn't listen.  And then, even after he'd told me
they were taking the bluing out of Final Touch, I didn't listen--   
.ch hu  
Darling?
.ch wi  
No, no, don't try to forgive me!  My crime is too great for that.  I must...
I must be brave.  I must be banished to the Home For Poor Housewives.

Dear--  
.ch wi  
Where the floors are never quite bright enough, where the rug always smells of  
the dog smoking cigars, where people never look at themselves in their plates--

For goodness' sake, Arlene--

Now Billy and Suzie, Mommy has to go away for a while... not long, thirteen 
or fourteen years, probably... because she's been bad.  Now, I want you to  
take care of yourselves and don't fight with each other, and never stick
the Q-tip right into your ear because if you sneeze you'll push it into 
your brain.  No, don't cry.  Now, Daddy's probably going to lose his job
because of Mommy's mistake, and you'll all be in the poorhouse. 
.ch kk  
(TOGETHER)  
Oh, Mommy, please don't go!  Please stay.   
.ch wi  
No, kids.  Mommy has sinned, and must be punished.  
.ch hu  
Oh come 
.ul 
on, 
Arlene, aren't you taking this too far? 
.ch wi  
You're right!  I don't deserve to live.  I must die.

Yes, even after cutting through skin, bone and a layer of subcutaneous fat, 
the incredible Ginsu knife can still slice through this tomato.
