.sb "Indian Isle" "Gilligan's Isle" 
.ve 4   
Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale  
A tale of a tragedy 
That started on this tiny stage 
As a Christie mystery.  
.ve 4   
The director was an amateur 
Or so we all would say  
Ten thespians set out to act
In a three hour play (a three hour play)
.ve 4   
The audience was getting bored  
They sensed it was a trap   
And so when intermission came   
They went to take a crap (a three hour crap)
.ve 6   
The curtain fell at the end of these
Three acts without a smile, 
With Emily, the Rogers too, 
An Adventurer, and a judge, 
The General, and the rest   
Are here on Indian Isle!
