FASS (that gifted group that put on this year's "ST. VALENTINE'S
DAY FASSACRE") is already starting to plan their show for next  
year.  YOU can be a part of it.  If you are interested in any aspect
of FASS (including such things as writing, acting, singing, dancing,
etc.) come to our general-purpose Brainstorming Session 
Wednesday, March 22 in the Campus Centre (Room XXX).
All Faculty, Administration, Students and Staff are welcome.
