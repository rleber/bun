FASS (that gifted group that put on last year's "ST. VALENTINE'S
DAY FASSACRE") is already starting to plan their show for February '79. 
YOU can be a part of it.  If you are interested in any aspect   
of FASS (including such things as writing, acting, singing, dancing,
etc.) come to our general-purpose information meeting   
Tuesday, October 3 at 8:00 in the Math Lounge (Math Building, room 5136).   
All Faculty, Administration, Students and Staff are welcome.
