Ox here, boss. We brought girl.

What do you know about the professor's machine?

(DEFIANTLY) Mary Anne Hammerstein. 3B Arts Major.   
ID number eighty-one, thirty six, twenty-four, thirty-eight.

Playing hard to get, mmmh? Queen, rough her up a bit.   
See if you can -- indoctrinate her.

(PULLING OUT A PERFUME SPRAY BOTTLE FROM HER PURSE) 
You should have talked, my pretty.  
This is Niagara Perfume!
.ch mf  
What's it made of?  
.ch cq  
It's made of the mist.  
(SPRAYS MARY ANNE WITH IT)  This will seep into your brain, 
and you'll be mine to command!  
.ch mf  
You and what army, powder-puff? 
.ch cq  
It's not working!   
She must have natural psychic defenses!

You talk sweetie or I'll turn the punster loose on you

(DARTH CO-ORDINATOR ENTERS CARRYING A BOTTLE OF COFFEE-MATE, LABELLED   
"UK-69")
.ch co  
Mr. Cabbage Patch, I have found it! 
.ad 
(WHILE THE VILLAINS ARE BUSY DISCUSSING THE UK69,   
LON SNEAKS IN AND CARRIES OFF THE BODY OF OUR DEAR  
MARYANN. OF COURSE THE VILLAINS DON'T NOTICE)   
.ch mc  
That's the big secret weapon?  That bottle of coffee-mate?  
.ch co  
Fool!  This is Uranium-Kryptonite 69, the most deadly substance in the  
university. 
.ch cf  
What's so deadly about it?  
.ch co  
Ah yes!  It does appear harmless, doesn't it?  Well it'll do more than  
just make your next cup of coffee taste great.  You just remember the   
three rules:  you mustn't get it wet, or expose it to bright sunlight   
.ch ww  
That's only two rules.  What's the third?   
.ch co  
You mustn't feed it after midnight. 
.ch cq  
(SHOCKED) Feed it?  You mean it's alive?!?  
.ch co  
Oh hellfire, of course it is and it reproduces at   
a horrendous rate when exposed to liquids.  It can radiate explosive
amounts of energy, throughout the entire electro-magnetic-spectrum. 
Fortunately, it's harmless now.  It all happens instantly when  
it dissolves into its component sub-atomic ion particles.   
.ch ox  
Daaa!  Quasi do you know what Darth Co-ordinator is talking about?  

.ch qs  
No but I have a hunch!  
.ch mt  
We'll slip this into the professor's coffee machine.
.ch cp  
The coffee will become contaminated with radioactive waste. 
The heroes will drink it, and the resultant discharge of pan-dimensional
energies will wipe out their super powers.  We'll literally blast   
them inside out!
.ch co  
And without their powers they'll be easy to kill off.   
.ch cp  
They're dead!  They're finished!  Now nothing can stand in our way of   
University domination.
