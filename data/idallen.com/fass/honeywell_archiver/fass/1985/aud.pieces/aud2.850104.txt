(FASS GORDON SOUNDS LIKE A TYPICAL ROGER-RAMJET STYLE SUPERHERO, BUT THE MAN
FROM GRAD IS AN ANCIENT ORIENTAL WITH A LONG WHITE BEARD, SOMETHING LIKE THE
MASTER ON KUNG FU, WITH A VOICE (AND ESPECIALLY A LAUGH) LIKE LIN YE TANG ON
SECOND CITY...AHA AHA AHA!) 
.ch fa  
I sure am glad that the 
recruitment for the rumble is being done by someone as wise and sage
as you, Man from Grad.  
.ch gr  
You are not as Grad as I am! aha aha aha!   
.ch fa  
What qualities are we looking for, master?  
.ch gr  
We require those with courage, loyalty (royarty!), and a
strong moral fibre. 
.ch fa  
Anything else?  
.ch gr  
Sexy tights and a set of knockers out   
to here (HOLDS HANDS OUT FROM CHEST)!  Aha aha aha! 
.ch fa  
Um...right.  Here   
come the first group of apricots-appricants-candidates! 
.ad 
(MAN FROM GRAD SITS AT TABLE, FASS TO HIS SIDE, STANDING.  THE FIRST GROUP OF   

APPLICANTS FORM A LINE IN FRONT OF THE RECRUITMENT TABLE.   
AN ALL-PURPOSE HERO-TYPE STRIDES UP TO THE DESK AND 
HANDS A RESUME TO THE MAN FROM GRAD)
.ch rd  
They call me redundancy man that's my name. Here's my resume, with my job   
history, and where I used to work.  
.ad 
(THE MAN FROM GRAD STOPS CHORTLING SUDDENLY AND FURROWS HIS BROWS SOLEMNLY TO LOOK  
DOWN AT THE RESUME) 
.ch gr  
Let me see.  You have the powers of an insect - 
Cockroach Man has that.  You can run forever without tiring -   
Jogger Nut has that.
(SCANS PAGE)  I just don't  
think we need you.  
.ch fa  
(CONSOLINGLY AGAIN)  Sorry, sorry...
.ch rd  
But what about my ability to kick villains when they're down?!?

(FASS LEADS HIM OFF)

(LON FUNCTION STEPS FORWARD WEARING A T-SHIRT WITH A LARGE 'W' ON IT)   
.ch gr  
Who are you?  (POINTING AT 'W')  Superwimp?  Aha aha aha!   
.ch ln  
(BOLDLY, IGNORING MAN FROM GRAD)  I call myself WILL POWER now! 
My old name, Lon Function, was a bit too... 
.xx ALL 
Wimpy?  
.ad 
(LON GIVES FASS A DISPLEASED LOOK)  
.ch gr  
What is your superpower, Will?  
.ch ln  
I can do an entire Stats assignment without falling asleep.

(EVERYONE ON STAGE DOES A DOUBLE TAKE IN AWE, PREFERABLY EXAGGERATED)   
.xx ALL 
Gasp
.ch ln  
And without a calculator.  I only use tables.   
.ch gr  
Don't you use a chair, too? Aha aha aha!

(LUNGES TO THROTTLE MAN FROM GRAD, SHAKING MAN FROM GRAD VIOLENTLY IN RAGE)

(CHOKING)  Please FASS!  Please!  I make joke!  (ROLLS  
WHEELCHAIR BACKWARD TO RUN OVER FASS'S FOOT)
.ad 
(FASS IMMEDIATELY LETS GO AND JUMPS UP AND DOWN, HOLDING FOOT IN PAIN)  
.ch gr  
(IGNORING FASS AND REGAINING COMPOSURE) Will Power is certainly 
welcome here.  You are accepted.
.ad 
(FASS STOPS JUMPING AND POINTS LON/WILL TO THE 'ACCEPTED' AREA) 
.ch gr  
Next!
