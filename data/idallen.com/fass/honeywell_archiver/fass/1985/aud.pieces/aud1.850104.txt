(THIS PART OF THE SCENE SHOULD TAKE PLACE IN FRONT OF THE CURTAIN.  
THE SCENE OPENS WITH WENDY SITTING IN AN ELECTRIC CHAIR.  LON ENTERS)

(SCREAMS LOUD AND LONG) 
.ch ln  
Wendy!

(LON TURNS OFF THE POWER ON THE ELECTRIC CHAIR) 
.ex 
I know things are rough, but that's no reason to try to kill yourself.  
.ch we  
No, you nincompoop.  I was trying to get a superpower by having 
a horrible freak accident.  
.ch ln  
It's not very accidental if you do it yourself. 
.ch we  
It doesn't have to be an accident; it only has to be
terrible enough to kill any normal human being. 
.ch ln  
I've had CS assignments like that...  Did it work?  Do you  
have a super power? 
.ch we  
No, you turned off the electric chair.  
.ch ln  
Oh, sorry!

(SOLILOQUY, AS WENDY SCREAMS IN THE BACKGROUND) 
Girls:  I never will understand them.   
I walk in and I see her screaming in pain.  I say to myself, "here's
a damsel in distress; I'll save her".  I don't expect much in return.   
A smile and "thank you", perhaps.  Some slight acknowledgement that 
but for me she would be have died a horrible, gruesome death.   
.ch we  
TURN...OFF...THE...POWER!   
.ch ln  
This puts me in a dilemma.  On the one hand, she's enduring 
a great deal of pain and asking me to relieve her suffering.  On the
other hand, by turning off the power I deprive her of a chance to   
become a super hero.
.ch we  
TURN...OFF...THE...POWER!   
.ch ln  
As I said, an acute moral dilemma.  
.ad 
(LON TAKES COIN OUT OF POCKET AND FLIPS IT) 
.ex 
Heads.  I save her! 
.ad 
(LON RUSHES TO THE MACHINE AND TURNS OFF THE POWER) 
.ch ln  
Are you all right?  
.ch we  
You idiot!  
.ch ln  
Oh no.  I did the wrong thing.  She wanted me to leave the power on.
(MOVES HIS HANDS TOWARDS THE SWITCH)
.ch we  
NO!!!!!!!!  
.ad 
(LON MOVES AWAY FROM THE MACHINE)   
.ex 
How could anyone be such a fool?  I ask you to turn off the power.  
Twice.  And what do you do?  You flip a coin to see if you should.  
You are an absolute imbecile.   
.ch ln  
Gosh, I'm sorry, Wendy.  Moral dilemmas have never been my strong suit. 
.ch we  
(BEGINNING TO REGAIN HER COMPOSURE) 
That's eight tries at getting a super power.  Eight tries; eight    
failures.   
.ch ln  
You know what I've heard, Wendy?  A lot of us have latent super 
powers inside us, only we don't know about them.    
.ch we  
A lot of good it does me to have a super power and not know it. 
.ch ln  
Well, I could write a computer program to find out if you have  
a latent super power.   
.ch we  
That would take years.  
.ch ln  
Not if I was writing it!
I could do it in just a few minutes, for you, Wendy.
.ch we  
Really?  Oh, Lon, if you found out that I had a super power 
I'd be so grateful.  I'd do anything for you!   
.ch ln  
Even go on a date with me?  
.ch we  
Don't push it.  
.ch ln  
I'll get on it right away.  
.ad 
(EXIT LON.  ENTER FROG MAN AND TADPOLE) 
.ch we  
Lon, look who's here!  Oh, damn!  He's gone!
.ch fg  
Calm down, Tadpole. 
.ch td  
But, Frog Man, she said you look like a toad and I look like
a sp

a sperm cell!   
.ch fg  
She's just trying to get you upset. 
The next time Bo Evil compares me to a toad, just tell her that 
toads don't have webbed feet (HOLDS UP WEBBED HAND), frogs do.  
.ch td  
Holy catcher's mit, Frog Man, you're right. 
.ch fg  
And, as for sperm cells...(WHISPERS IN TADPOLE'S EAR)   
.ch td  
Really? 
.ch fg  
One of these days I'll show you, little buddy.  
.ch we  
Excuse me.  I wonder if you two could help me.  I'm trying to get a 
super power.
.ch fg  
Have you tried getting into a freak accident?   
.ch we  
Yes, eight times.  And each time I've failed.   
.ch td  
Holy Joe Clark, Frog Man, she's a loser!
.ad 
(WENDY STARTS TO CRY)   
.ch fg  
Don't cry, young lady.  I have something you can try.  A miniature  
atomic powered exploding lily pad.

Holy hand grenade, Frog man!

.ch ln  
I've found it!  Your latent superpower.  Wendy, you have nine lives!
.ch we  
(SLOWLY COUNTS TO NINE ON HER FINGERS AND FALLS DEAD)   
.ch ln  
Oh, Wendy!  
(SOLILOQUY:)  I loved her more than anything else in the world. 
I just know that in time she would have gone out with me.  I even   
made up this costume for her.  (HOLDS UP CAT SUIT)  
.ch td  
Holy Heartbreak, Frog Man!  
.ch ln  
I was thinking maybe one day we could   
settle down in  Scarborough and have 2.4 kids and a dog 
(LOOKS AT CAT SUIT)... scratch the dog. 
.ch fg  
We'll all miss her, Lon. But the fight against evil must go on. 
.ch td  
She would have wanted it that way!  
.ch ln  
The program said that I have a super power, too.  I'll use my   
power to fight evil, and I'll do it for you, Wendy! 
.ad 
(LON EXITS) 
.ch fg  
There's a lesson in this, Tadpole.  
.ch td  
That true love is stronger even than death? 
.ch fg  
No, that you can give someone a super power, but he'll still be a wimp.
