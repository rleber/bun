.ch cp  
Welcome fellow supervillains.  You have been chosen not 
only for your great talents, but because you are generally (PAUSES, THEN
WITH GUSTO) mean, evil, loathsome, despicable... (GETS CHOKED UP)   
.ch cc  
Gets you right her. (INDICATES HEART)   
.ch dk  
I had that removed. 
.ch cp  
(SOBBING WITH JOY)  You're all so vile and disgusting - like the family 
I never had...  
.ch dk  
(PROUDLY)  They truly are a wretched crew.  
.ch pn  
(BURSTING IN FROM OFFSTAGE)  Wretched crew?  You guys talking   
about my haircut?   
.ch dk  
(WITHOUT LOOKING)  Ah Punster!  Tell us about the heroes' foul plan.
.ch pn  
Foul plan... I didn't know they were using chickens!
.ch dk  
(SPINS AND PUTS PUNSTER IN STRANGLE FORCE-GRIP)  Save your  
horrid puns for the heroes.  Give us a report.  (RELEASES HIM SUDDENLY) 
.ch pn  
(RUBBING THROAT)  Yes, Lord Co-Ordinator.  They are sending 

ten heroes to Fed Hall... their leader is FASS, (PERKS UP) in fact he's 
so FASS (DARTH TURNS, PUNSTER CATCHES HIMSELF) ...  
.ch dk  
FASS Gordon.
.ch cp  
That pansy with the ray gun?  I'll rip him to   
shreds.  I'll stick Absorbine Jr. in his jockey shorts! 
I'll force him to watch 
Laverne & Shirley reruns!   
.ch dk  
That's the spirit.  We can't afford to lose our funding so we must make 
sure the heroes don't get any money.  And you KNOW how we do this!  
.xx SLIME~OF~THE~STREET 
Make them wait in line at the Commerce in the CC?   
.ch dk  
No, you ninny!  By terminating the heroes.  
.ch cp  
Eleven of us - waiting in ambush for ten of them.   
It'll be a massacre.  We'll slaughter 'em.  We'll   
dismember them.  (PAUSE, THEN TO AUDIENCE)  I love this job!
