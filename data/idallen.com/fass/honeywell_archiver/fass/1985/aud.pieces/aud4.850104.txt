(TO CAPTAIN UNIVERSITY:)
Weren't you in a class of mine a few years ago? 
.ch cu  
Yes, before I went into superheroism,   
but that seems like a very long time ago.   

Since that time I've discovered my true 
potential, I've found a destiny worth   
pursuing. To fight evil, right wrong... 
to boldly go where no mere mortal could tread.  
To uphold the values of truth, justice and mom's
apple pie.

That means it's probably ..... stolen!  
Couldn't you get into trouble if the Administration found out?  
.ch pr
