Mr. Cabbage Patch, I have found it!     
.ch mt  
That's the big secret weapon?  That bottle of coffee-mate?  
.ch co  
Fool!  This is Mulronium, the most deadly substance in the  
university. 
.ch cf  
What's so deadly about it?  
.ch co  
Ah yes!  It does appear harmless, doesn't it?  Well it'll do more than  
just make your next cup of coffee taste great.  Just remember the   
three rules:  you mustn't get it wet, or expose it to bright sunlight.  
.ch ww  
That's only two rules.  What's the third?   
.ch co  
You mustn't feed it after midnight. 
.ch cq  
(SHOCKED) Feed it?  You mean it's alive?!?  
.ch co  
Of course it is and it reproduces at
a horrendous rate when exposed to liquids.  It can radiate explosive
amounts of energy, throughout the entire electro-magnetic-spectrum. 
Fortunately, it's harmless now.  It all happens instantly when  
it dissolves into its component sub-atomic ion particles.   
.ch ox  
Duh...  Quasi know what Darth talking about?
.ch qs  
No, but I have a hunch! 
.ch mt  
We'll slip this into the professor's coffee machine.
.ch cp  
The coffee will become contaminated with radioactive waste. 
The heroes will drink it, and the resultant discharge of pan-dimensional
energies will wipe out their super powers.  We'll literally blast   
them inside out!

And without their powers they'll be easy to kill off.
