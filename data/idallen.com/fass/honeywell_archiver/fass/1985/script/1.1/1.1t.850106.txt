Oh, this is the FASS show, FASS show, FASS show,

Although it goes longer than it should.

.ch s1  
This is so exciting!  An epic battle
right here at the university.   
Good versus evil.  Superheroes and supervillains fighting for control   
of the universe...  
.ch s2  
It's only a football game!  
.ch s1  
But, what a football game!  500 yard passes, field goal attempts from   
Alpha Centauri, special effects so spectacular that extra technicians   
had to be brought in all the way from Guelph...

(ENTER WENDY)   
.ch s3  
Hi guys.
.ch s2  
Hi there!  Want to go to the football game with us? 
.ch s3  
Sorry boys.  I'm going out with Rubber Man. 
.ch s1  
Talk about a safe date! 
.ad 
(WENDY EXITS)   
.ch s2  
Ever since they formed the Superhero and Supervillain   
departments it's been impossible to get a date.  Girls won't pay
any attention to you unless you're a weirdo in sexy tights. 
.ch s1  

Well, there are some
.ul 
female  
superheroes and supervillains.  You could always ask one of them for
a date. 
.ch s2  
Oh, no! 
.ch s1  
Are you afraid of them? 
.ch s2  
Well, I don't mind assertive women...   
.ch s1  
Uh, huh.
.ch s2  
And, I'm certainly not afraid of women who are stronger than me.
.ch s1  
Of course not.  
.ch s2  
But the last guy to date one got his face slapped half way  
to Cambridge.  Now they're using him as a sculpture outside 
the Math building.  
.ad 
(THE STUDENTS BEGIN WALKING TOWARDS THE EXIT)   
.ch s1  
Well, I'm not afraid of them.  Just the other day I had a date with 
Timex Woman.
.ch s2  
Timex Woman??   
.ch s1  
Yeah.  She said, "I'll always have time for you".   
.ch s2  
There's no such person as Timex Woman.  
.ch s1  
We're taking our relationship minute by minute. 
.ch s2  
You're making this up.  
.ch s1  
(CONFIDENTIALLY:)  She takes a licking and keeps on ticking.

I know, sir.

I mean, I try. I really try.
.ch as  
Yes, you certainly try, sir.

How do they expect me to deal with superheroes and supervillains,

They must be mad, sir.

I suffer so much...

The Bovine Commission and Bessie Seventonne want to cut our funding.
Can you imagine that?

It strains belief, sir.

Hello, Dr. Wright.  I'm Bessie Seventonne.  Lovely university you   
have here.  Terrible coffee, though.  I think we'll have to cut 
your funding by  50 percent.
.ch b1  
I'd say 60. 
.ch b2  
75. 
.ch b3  
Any advance on 75...
Once, twice, done!  
.ch dw  
You want a funding cut of 75 percent?   
.ch bs  
We'll phase it in.  Over six months.
.ch dw  
All because you don't like our coffee?  
.ch bs  
I think it's sufficient grounds.
.ch b1  
You can't seem to find good coffee anywhere these days. 
.ch b2  
Western, Guelph, Queens.  It looks like we may gut the whole
post-secondary education system before we find a decent cup of coffee.

.ch dw  
Wait!  There's something you haven't considered.  We have a research    
project  to find the perfect cup of coffee.     
We'll have to cancel the project if you cut our funding.

Alright, you've got twenty-four hours.

There's a sad story about this villain, Ray.
Ten million Cabbage Patch Kids were adopted by families around the  

world, but one wasn't.  He spent twenty years of his life
