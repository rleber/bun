MACHINE GUN, BUT SHE IS STILL BULLYING THE VOLUNTEERS.  
SHE HAS THEM MARCHING IN A SEMI-MILITARY FORMATION) 
.ch pr  
(SINGS) It's a wonderful day in the faculty 
a wonderful day to be neighbours
would you be mine?  
(NO LONGER SINGING) Hello little helpers.  It was so nice of you to come    
and see me today.  Sorry I'm late, I had to feed Mr.    
Goldfish......To Mr. Piranha.   
.ch lf  
Professor, aren't we supposed to be doing something with
coffee? 
.ch bo  
I've heard that coffee can keep you up all night.   
.ch ma  
I'm working on that angle.  
.ch pr  
(TO CAPTAIN UNIVERSITY:)
Weren't you in a class of mine a few years ago? 
.ch cu  
Yes, before I went into superheroism,   

but that seems like a very long time ago.   
Since then I've discovered my true  
potential, I've found a destiny worth   
pursuing. To fight evil, to right wrong...  
To uphold the values of truth, justice and  
the Queen Elizabeth Way.
.ch pr  
You weren't called Captain University then.  You had another name... what was   
it, now...? 
.ch cu  
It's of no consequence.

Timothy Lipschitz, wasn't it?

Timothy Lipshitz.   
Wait till the gang hears this.  
.ch pr  
Now  we can get to work. I've already assembled the major parts of my machine.  
Your job is to      
bring in the parts and put them together.

(THE FOUR GO OFF AND BRING ON SEVERAL

.ch lf  
Golly Professor, where did you get all this neat stuff? 
.ch pr  
The Engineers just had their scavenger  
hunt.   
.ch wl  
And they gave you everything?   
.ch pr  
Well, not everything. But I didn't need last week's Globe and Mail or   
a flock of sheep.   
.ch lf  
(ASTONISHED) Engineers? 
That means it's probably... stolen! 
Couldn't you get into trouble if the Administration found out?  
.ch pr  
They can't screw with me, I've got tenure.  
(TO SHEENA AND WONDER BROAD)
How would you like to come and help with some experiments   
that I set up?  
(NO SIGN OF DISSENT)
Sure, I knew you would. (TO CAPT. AND BO)   
Stay here, I'll need you later.

.ch bo  
Hey, Captain Lipshitz!  
.ch cu  
My name is Captain University.  
Remember it,
cause you'll be seeing it on your arrest record.
When your department gets cut, we superheroes will  
wipe out you vile scum. 
.ch bo  
.ul 
My  
department won't be cut,
you upholder of truth and justice, you! 
.ch cu  
Who are you calling an upholder of truth and justice?!?!
(PAUSE)  Oh.  Never mind.   
.ch bo  
Don't worry, Timmy... when your department gets cut,
you can always come crawling to us for a job.   
.ch cu  
(DEFIANTLY:) I don't know how to crawl. 
.ch bo  
I'll teach you.

(CAPTAIN AND BO RELAX A BIT)
.ex 
I've been working on different blends of coffee.  Would you mind
tasting my latest batch?
.ch cu  
Number nine, eh?  I take it numbers one through eight were failures?
.ch ma  
Not entirely.  The Engineers are using number three as a rust   
remover and the defence department is very interested in number seven.  
.ch bo  
I'll pass, thanks.  
.ch cu  
Yeah,   
my doctor says drinking coffee is bad for my health.
.ch ma  
(RAISING BAZOOKA)   
So are anti-tank weapons.   
.ch cu  
(TO ROGERS) Cream, no sugar.
.ch pr  
Please rate the coffee on the following scale:  
Ambrosia, Home made, Tim Hortons,  Hot water, Food Services,
10W30, Village.

(ROGERS POURS OUT TWO CUPS OF COFFEE.  THE CAPTAIN AND BO TAKE  
THEM AND DRINK) 
.ch bo  
Ugh, horrible, vile!  This stuff tastes like Laurel Creek   
sludge! 
.ch cu  
(DISGUSTED EXPRESSION) I'd rate this just above Food Services.  
.ch bo  
About right.
.ch pr  
Thank you.

(ROGERS TURNS TO LEAVE, TAKING POT WITH HIM.  HE TAKES OUT A DICTATING  
MACHINE AND TURNS IT ON)
.ex 
Umm.  Re experiment number nine, colon, 
(PAUSE) Qualified success...
.ig 
the process of exposing coffee  
beans to bombardment by high energy pions before grinding must be   
considered a failure, period.  Subjective evaluation    
of the taste enhancement by independent subjects indicated a net
negative effect, period.  Decision, colon, abandon this line of inquiry 
period. (HE TURNS OFF MACHINE)  I wonder what the hell this stuff is?

(SHYLY)  Did I ever tell you that I think you look  
kind of, uh, cute in leather.   
.ch bo  
(EMBARASSED)  Thank you.  You know I never mentioned this before
but you look really sexy in those tights.

I love you, Bo. 
.ch bo  
Do you, do you really?  
.ch cu  
Yes, Bo...  
Oh, I'll tell you something 
I think you'll understand.  
When I say that something,  
I wanna hold your hand. 
And when I touch you,   
I feel happy inside.
There's such a feeling  
that my love, I can't hide. 
I can't hide.   
.ch bo  
Oh poetry, I've never had anybody write poetry for me before.   
Marry me, Timothy!  
.ch cu  
Oh Bo! Bo!  
.ch bo  
But Timmy, our careers conflict.
One day I'll ask you "how was your day",
and you'll tell me you arrested my three best friends.  
.ch cu  
Yes, it would be a strain on marital bliss if   
I were to ask you what you were doing one afternoon 
and it turned out you were planning to  
assassinate half my crime-fighting partners!
.ch bo  
There's only one thing to do.  We're going to have to change
faculties.  
.ch cu  
Bo, do you really mean it?  But I thought you would only like the   
dangerous life, fast cars, death rays, plots to take
over the world! 
.ch bo  
Oh, no.  I think I would prefer a more sedate   
academic life.  
.ch cu  
How ripping, so would I.

(CAPTAIN:) A life of strife does not appeal to me at all.   
           Do you agree at all? 
.ve 1   
(BO:) I do  
.ve 2   
(CAPTAIN:) The mere idea of being a world saviour is,   
           So very dangerous.   
.ve 1   
(BO:) That's true.  
.ve 3   
(CAPTAIN:) I've got a rather safer sort of life in mind 
           It's something more refined, to do.  
           Would you care to hear about it dear?
.ve 1   
(BO:) Would I care to, can you doubt it dear?   
.ve 6   
(CAPTAIN:) All I want is a lib-ral arts degree  
           It's devoid of all prac-tical-ity
           I'll study literature
           And I'll understand Freud
           I'll be quite scholarly  
           Though I may be unemployed.  
.ve 8   
(CAPTAIN:) I will quote from Shakespeare
           To pass the time 
           While I am waiting in
           The welfare line.
           I'll wait on tables  
           Or clean out stables 
           But oh how happy I'll be 
           With my dear little liber

           With my dear little liberal arts degree  
.ne 5   
.ve 6   
(BO:) All I want is a lib-ral arts degree   
      I will major in Greek philosophy. 
      I'll study the arcane 
      The obscure and abstruse  
      I'll treat with high distain  
      Anything of any use.  
.ve 4   
      I will read all the works 
      Of Socrates   
      While my OSAP provides
      A life of ease.

(BOTH:) We'll seek enjoyment
        In unemployment 
        And contemplation when we

(BO AND CAPTAIN DO NOT NOTICE ROGERS BUT MERELY STARE INTO  
EACH OTHERS EYES)   
.ch bo  
I'd love to...  
.ch cu  
Do you think we should?

Of course you should, after all that's what you're here for.
Come here, I'll show you how.

This is the central gyroscopic stabilizing unit. I want you 
three to install it.
.ch ma  
Okay, you spineless weaklings, we have to get it up and insert it   
here.  Be careful, all the gold and platinum components make it 
heavier than it looks.

Yes.

(BO POCKETS THE TOOL)   
.ch cu  
That's amazing, with funding being so tight these days. 
.ch pr  
Funding's tight?  That's strange.  Dr. Wright said "money is no object".
He's going to take the money from the Faculty of Applied
Superlative Studies.
.xx CAPTAIN~UNIVERSITY~AND~BO   
Superlative Studies?!?  
.ch pr  
Yes, he's going to eliminate either the Superhero Department
or the Supervillain Department. 
.ch cu  
Superhero Department?   
.ch bo  
Supervillain Department?
.ch pr  
Yes.  It's a bit of a waste having two departments, when you think  
about it.  They study essentially the same things.

We'll be back in a minute.  Keep up the good work.

why the funding's being cut.
We've got to tell our friends about this.

hardly gotten to know each other.

I suppose there would be no harm in us sitting and talking for  
a while.

And maybe going to a movie.

Right.  But immediately after the movie...

...and cocktails at my place
