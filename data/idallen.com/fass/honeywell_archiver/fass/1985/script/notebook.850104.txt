FASS 1985 Script Notebook   
------------------------------------------------------- 
Monday, December 17 


Today, I made the changes we agreed to on Sunday.   
All scenes have been updated.   


I had volunteered to shrink down the first four pages   
of I:4 to two pages.  I made the changes, but it turns  
out that my rewrite of that section doesn't make it 
any shorter (but I think it's a lot better).  In any
case, I:4 without my rewrite of the opening is saved
in a file called "1.4safe".  I:4 with my rewrite is 
saved in "1.4t".    


There are sections in I:2 that we were going to 
shorten.  I plan to do this tomorrow.  (And I really
will shorten these sections, honest!)

I shortened several sections of I:2.  The new version   
is saved as "1.2t", the old one as "1.2safe".  The  
new version really is shorter.  


I "tf"ed I:2 and I:4.  1.2.out and 1.4.out are the  
changed versions.  I didn't tf any of the other 
scenes.     



We still need to write the Punster into II:2 (torture). 
I thought I'd leave that for you.

Tuesday December 18 Evening 


I have tf'd all the scenes to there output files __.out 
Yes the punster will be added but have not done it yet. 
thank-you steve for the adds and changes.   
PLease contact margaret and tell her that Thursday has  
become a bad evening to meet to discuss the script. 
Would it be possible to do it on sunday evening or  
perhaps thursday evening of the next week.(27th)
I'm sorry for the inconvience but some of us do have
wives and children. 
I tried to phone but was unsuccessful.  
Thanx           
                                       Tom.

Wednesday December 19   


I'm printing off 4 copies of the script -- one for  
me, one for Margaret, one for Steve Hayman (the 
music director), and one for Bernie.  (Bernie offered   
to look at the script over the holidays and it seemed   
like a good idea to me.)    

es. I'll talk to Margaret about moving our meeting. 

I'll talk to Margaret about moving our meeting.  Next   
Thursday is OK for me, as is Sunday evening.

Dec 29  


In 2.3 the song "I don't know how to end it" still  
has Captain University singing  
"To put an end to my existence" 
I changed this at one point to  
"To end my sad existence"   
which fits the scansion (sp?) much better.  
Was this ever changed and if so was it changed back?
I have not changed the file but would suggest the change be 
made.  (I changed line 27 in 2.1 from grad man to cockroach 
man.)   
Also in 2.3, answere (b) and (c) to the first question  
(Old Lady at corner) should be switched (and appropriate
changes made in the next couple of lines).  Or if   
not 2.7 should be changed to be consistent with this scene

One major point, two minor points, one flame


1.1  Why is the rumble no longer associated with the spending cuts. 
     This makes hash of what little was left of the plot.  In   ....     particular 2.1 now makes no sense w

     particular 2.1 now makes no sense whatsoever   


2.1  Changing the ending to get rid of Shit is inane.  Also 
     if Captain University is so strong and macho why in the
     hell does he attempt suicide.  


        ******   FLAME ON  ******** 


2.4   The Angela Mercy sledgehammer sucks moonrocks through a straw 
      badly.  This point was discussed at great length during the   
      plotting of the show.  We agreed that it was possible, in 
      fact not that difficult, to turn the coffee machine into  
      a bomb in such an obvious manner that even a moron in the 
      last row of the balcony would know what was going on. 
      This idiotic device adds nothing and detracts seriously   
      from the flow of the play.  Please reconsider

The files in the 2.7 catalog are now renamed and moved to 2.6, and the  
old 2.6 is sitting under /script.
