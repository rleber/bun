.sb "Judgement Day" "Jamaica Farewell"  
.xx ANGELS  
.ve 6   
Back on Earth,  
Where we had our birth, 
We were helping little ladies all the time. 
Our thoughts were good, 
We did what we should,  
And every hour was given to fighting crime. 
.ve 5   
(And it's) Sad to say we've passed away.
Won't be back 'till judgement day.  
We had to die,  
But since we never lie, 
We've gone to join the flying angels in the sky.
.xx DEVILS  
.ve 6   
Back on Earth,  
Where we had our birth, 
We were mean and nasty buggers all the time.
Our plots were bad, 
And the cops were mad,  
'Cause we were supervillains and lords of crime.
.ve 5   
(And it's) Sad to say we've passed away.
Won't be back 'till judgement day.  
We've gone to hell, 
The place where sinners yell,   
We see the brimstone burning bright where Satan fell.
