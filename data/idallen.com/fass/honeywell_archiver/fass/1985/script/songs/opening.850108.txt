Oh, this is the FASS show, FASS show, FASS show,
And, really, we hope you think it's good,   
Although it goes longer than it should. 
'Cause this is the FASS show, FASS show, FASS show, 
We're doing in Nineteen Eighty-five!

We're glad that we finally got the chance,

(MaybeWe'reGoodAndYetMaybeWe'reBad) 
.ti 5   
(AndYetMaybeNobodyCanTell)  
To sing you a song, 
.ti 5   
(MaybeNobodyCanTell)
Or do you a dance.  
.ti 5   
(MaybeNobodyCanTell)
We hope that you'll get the jokes and laugh,
.ti 5   
(MaybeWe'reGoodAndYetMaybeWe'reBad) 
.ti 5   
(AndYetMaybeNobodyCanTell)  
Because, you see, this is the point of a FASS show.

And now it's time to introduce the characters,  
Because, without them, we would have no show.   
.ti 5   
(WithoutThemWeCouldn'tPresentTheShow)   
And if we may, we'd like to say,
We're going to rhyme their names off,   

Just because we thought you'd like to know!

(Oh no they don't!) Oh yes they do! 
(Oh no they don't!) Oh yes they do! 
(Oh no they don't!) They do! (They don't!)  
They do! (They don't!) DO!

The Superheroes are all here to do good deeds,  
.ti 5   
(Please pay no heed--, anything they have to say,)  
Upholding Truth and Mom and Apple Pie!  
.ti 5   
(Not even worth-- all-the-air they'll use)  
So never mind the other slime,  
They're here to practice evil   
.ti 5   
(We are the best, forget the rest,) 
.ti 5   
(We've got the whole thing sewn up,)
Keep your eyes on us, we're gonna fly!  
.ti 5   
(Never mind those guys, they're going to lose!)

Together: FASS!
