Villains, come to me,   
And tell me what you see (ha ha)
You ain't seen the worst of it yet, 
Eternal torment, no respite from the pain.  
Come, no time to lose   
And tell me what torture you choose!
I'll make you scream, yes, I'll make you pay!   
'Til the final Judgement Day.

We tested all pleasures illicit,
Nothing that we wouldn't try!

Heroes, over here,  
For soon before God you'll appear.  

Your reward for doing things right, 
Staying clean, brushing teeth every night, every night  
And now you'll take wing
Into the realm where Angels sing!   
You can all leave, go on, fly away. 
Enjoy yourselves until Judgement Day.

The show is all but through 
And you've seen nothing new 
Despite our efforts, we'll take the blame   
The writers thwart us, the ending is always the same
So go back where you've been
And tell all your friends what you've seen  
When they hear just how you complain
They'll come to see us, and we'll have a full house again.
