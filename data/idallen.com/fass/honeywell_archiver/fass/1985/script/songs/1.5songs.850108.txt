.ve 6   
Have you heard the news, it's all over the school,  
Those supervillains, they've broken the rule,   
Sent us a message, be here by eight,
So now we're here, today is the date.   
They want to rumble, they want to fight!
Superheroes are gonna rumble tonight!   
.ve 6   
They got a message that Bessie won't pay,   
They've lost their funding, it's taken away.
So now they're finished, they're out on the street, 
Holes in the pockets, nothing to eat.   
They want to rumble, they want to fight 
Superheroes gonna rumble tonight!   
.ve 6   
Superheroes gonna rumble tonight! (Sing with us)
Superheroes gonna rumble tonight!   
They is bad,
Big Bessie got mad! 
Now rumour has it, that they're uptight.
All the school is getting ready to fight,   
Superheroes gonna rumble tonight!   
.ve 6   
Beat em up! 
Knock em down!  
Beat em up! 
Knock em down!  
They want to rumble, they want to fight!
Superheroes gonna rumble tonight!   
.ve 6   

Know what you're thinking, it comes in quite clear. 
Who's going to watch them, when we're stuck in here.
Well don't you worry, we'll get them today, 
Beat them so bad, they won't move 'til May. 
They want to rumble, they want to fight!
Superheroes gonna rumble tonight!

(SUPERVILLAINS:) A disgruntled band of villains we, 
                 Who have no more a faculty,
                 Are coming to set our anger free,  
                 And kill off all the good guys.
.ve 4   
(FASS:)          Hush, Hush, I hear them,   
                 On the Fed Hall poaching,  
                 With ragged song,  
                 The villains are approaching.  
.ve 4   
(SUPERVILLAINS:) We'll make you quail, we'll make you run,  
                 We'll zap with you with our disrupter gun, 
                 Then send you off to kingdom come  
                 And thus get all our funding.  
.ve 1   
(SUPERHEROES:) They'll send us off to Kingdom Come! 
.ve 1   
(SUPERVILLAINS:) We'll send you off to Kingdom Come!

(FASS GORDON:) They come in force,  
               So let us hide,  
               We'll get them once  
               They are inside. 
.ve 8   
(SUPERVILLAINS:) With Rat-like tread,   
                 Upon our foes we creep.
                 To get our bread,  
                 And make their loved ones weep.    
                 No quarter give,   
                 We'll beat them black and blue.
                 They won't live,   
                 When we are through!   
.ve 1   
(SUPERHEROES:) To Kingdom Come, to Kingdom Come.
.ve 2   
(SUPERVILLAINS:) So wickedly the villains plot, 
                 So we can get what we have not.

                 Wouldn't it be dandy?  
                 And with our evil deeds,   
                 Convince them of our funding needs.

If those villains think that they're the best,  
Tell them to just compare the rest, 
'Cause it shows,
We are the pros.

Villains acting reprehensible,  
Will find they're indefensible, 
We suppose. 
We are the pros.

They'll find we're here tonight 
Cause it's clear tonight
That good's good tonight
As it should tonight
And we will fight tonight   
To make it right tonight
And the problem we will close

So come on all you damn misanthropists  
We're gonna fight you and throw fists   
At your nose
We are the pros!
