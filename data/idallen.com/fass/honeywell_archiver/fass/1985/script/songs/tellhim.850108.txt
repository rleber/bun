.sb "Knock'em Out Cold" "Tell Him"  
.ve 8   
(VILLAINS:) We know what is the most fun,   
            It's breaking peoples' heads,   
            Acting like Atilla the Hun, 
            And mutilating. 
            So we're challenging you
            To a knock-down fight.  
            We will murder you  
            At Fed Hall tonight.
.ve 3   
Punch them where they'll feel like they're on fire, 
Kick them where their voices will go higher,
Sock 'em, block 'em, shock 'em, knock 'em out cold. 
.ve 6   
(HEROES, SMUGLY:) Heroes don't get mad, 
                  And they are never bad,   
                  And heroes never grumble. 
                  Since we obey the rules,  
                  We must not fight you fools,  
                  We will not rumble.  Oh, no...
.ve 1   
(IN THIS VERSE THE HEROES GET ANGRIER AND ANGRIER)

(VILLAINS:) Be at Fed Hall before eight 
            'Cause we will bring a bomb.
            And if you arrive there too late,   
            We'll detonate it.  
            But you won't show up   

            'Cause you have no guts.
            And we'll say that your 
            Mothers all were sluts. 
.ve 3   
(HEROES:) Punch them where they'll feel like they're on fire,   
          Kick them where their voices will go higher,  
(ALL:)    Sock 'em, block 'em, shock 'em, knock 'em out cold.
