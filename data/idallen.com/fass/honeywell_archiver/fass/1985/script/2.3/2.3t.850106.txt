(LIGHTS UP STAGE RIGHT.  AUNTIE K'FURNITURE IS SITTING IN A ROCKING CHAIR   
KNITTING.  BESIDE HER CHAIR IS AN ENORMOUS BAG WITH WOOL, NEEDLES,  
ETC.  BO IS PACING BACK AND FORTH EXCITEDLY)
.ch mc  
Look dearie,  I don't know what you see in this boy Timothy.  Now,  
I remember my husband.   There was an exciting man.  They used to   
call him the Sheffield Shredder, killed fourteen legal secretaries. 
Took over a hundred bobbies to finally  
capture him ... 
.ch bo  
(INTERRUPTING IMPATIENTLY) I don't know why he attracts me, Auntie K'furniture. 
I only  
know that I'm in love with him, and that I'll do anything to
get him.  Anything!

(PACING AGAIN) Can't you help me, please?   
I've got to learn how to be .... good.  
.ch mc  
I don't think Darth Co-ordinator would approve. 
.ch bo  
There's a thousand bucks in it for you. 
.ch mc  
But on the other hand there's no need for anyone to tell him, is there  
dearie? 
Hmm...let me see.  (SEARCHES THROUGH PURSE TOSSING OUT ODD ITEMS)   
Here it is.  "How to Be Good and Influence People", 
by Hopcropft,Ullman and Carnegie.  This should be a 
good start.  Let's see, lesson number one:  You are at a street 
and you see an old lady, do you: a) Help her across the street; b) Ignore   
her;
c) Steal her purse and push her under a bus?
.ch bo  
(IMPULSIVELY) (c).  
.ch mc  
No no, dearie. It says here the correct answer is (a).  
.ch bo  
What?!?  Why would I want to help some old bag across the street?   
.ch mc  
Apparently that's the sort of thing good
people do.  Well, let's try number two.  Don't answer so quickly this time. 
You purchase a small item at the supermarket and the clerk gives you a  
$20 bill instead of a $1 bill in your change. Do you: a) Keep the money;
b) Quietly return the money;
c) Rob the clerk at gunpoint.   
.ch bo  
Let's see.  I would choose (c).  But... 
Hmm, how about (a)? 
.ch mc  
Well, that's a bit better dearie, but I don't think you've quite got
the hang of it yet.  Let's try number three.

What the Kentucky Fried Chicken was that?  Oh hi, Captain.  (SEES   
WEAPONS)  Wow, Captain, did you just put down another communist inspired
revolution in a small Central American country? 
.ch cu  
Small Central American countries was last year's show.  No, Super Chicken, I have   ....decided to put an end to

.ch cm  
Why would you want to do that?  
.ch cu  
My love for Bo is bigger than the Fed Hall budget.  
Without her, life is not worth living.

           I don't know what can harm me.   
           I only want  
           To kill myself,

(BO:) I don't know how to be good   
      I have always been so evil.   
      When I was small  
      I took a match
      And cremated my puppy dog 
      And then I torched the cat.   
      I was a brat.

(BO:) Should I make a stand 
      Fight for human rights?

(CAPTAIN:) I tried to use explosives
           To put an end to my existence.   
           I took out half  
           A city block,
           And gave myself a small headache,
           And slightly bruised my thigh.   
           I just won't die!
.ve 7   
(CAPTAIN:) Tried to stab myself 
           Barely felt a prick.

      Maybe we can be together  
      All I want

      Just to let him know

Wait a minute.  
You're in love with Bo, but you can't marry her because 
you're good and she's   
evil. Right?

Right!
