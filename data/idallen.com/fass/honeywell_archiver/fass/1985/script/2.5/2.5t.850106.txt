.ch pr  
Welcome to my laboratory, It's a beautiful laboratory.  
.ch bs  
(IN A DEEP SINISTER VOICE)  
I hope you have completed the machine.  
.ch pr  
My students and I have worked around the clock. 
.ch bs  
Be glad that I am overseeing this project...
the Premier is not as forgiving as I.   
Now,
would you please explain exactly    
how your machine works? 
.ch pr  
Well you see boys and girls, the machine maximizes the potential
impact of the solution on the homo sapiens palate by adjusting  
the thermal level of the primary infusion of the organic matter 
with the hydrogen-hydroxide. Then the organic matter
is particularized with extreme prejudice to those particles 
which will result in maximum benefit before the infusion
process.
.ch bs  
I see, but there is one part we didn't quite understand.
.ch pr  
Which part was that?
.xx all 
The part after "Well, you see boys and girls."  
.ch bk  
What the professor said was that it makes great coffee. 
.ch bs  
That's for us to decide.
I suppose your machine requires the pushing of a button?
.ch pr  
Why, of course. What's a machine without a button?  
.ch bs  
Good, that is why we brought Sven (INDICATING THE STUDENT   
WITH THE HIDDEN HAND) He's our Co-op button-pusher. 
Sven come here, Sven...(HE IS DISTRACTED BY MARY ANNE)  
Sven I'm calling Yo-o-o-o-u

LONG FOREFINGER.  HE STEPS OVER TO BESSIE)  
.ch sv  
Yumpin Yimminy, you don't have to yell!  (NOTE THE SWEDISH  
ACCENT) 
.ch pr  
All you have to do is put a quarter in the machine and then 
press the button.   
.ad 
(SVEN PUTS A QUARTER IN THE MACHINE AND THEN PRESSES THE BUTTON.  A 
FLASH-POT GOES OFF AND WHEN SVEN REMOVES HIS FINGER FROM THE BUTTON,
THE END OF IT IS GLOWING)   
.ch sv  
(IN AN E.T. VOICE) Youch!   
.ch pr  
Naughty, naughty, you tried to use a slug. One more time.

A MARCHING BAND STARTS UP, CONFETTI FLIES OUT, AND TWO FLAGS    
POP OUT AND WAVE IN THE AIR 
FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE MACHINE A BALLOON SLOWLY INFLATES    
UNTIL IT POPS)

I'm Eric The Blue.  
.ch bs  
I thought it was Eric The Red.  
.ch v1  
No I'm a Norse of a different colour.   
.ch pr  
Well, it appears that a discontinuity in the temporal feedback  
characteristic has caused a localized spatial distortion, resulting 
in chronological inversion with corporeal replication. Can you  
say corporeal replication?  
.ch bk  
(KEENER ENGINEERING TYPE) What it means is that the 
coffee machine has turned into a combination time transporter   
and Xerox copier. We learned that in Systems Design 161.
.ch duk 
Sven has been turned into a Viking and is being duplicated!
