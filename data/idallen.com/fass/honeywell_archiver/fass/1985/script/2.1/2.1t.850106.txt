The Bovine Commission gave top priority to Professor Rogers' new coffee 
machine.  It's costing so much money that one department will have to   
be cut.  Either the superheroes or the supervillains will be out on the 
street. 
.ch fg  
What! (TO CAPTAIN) Is this true?
.ch cu  
It's true. I heard it myself.  The real problem is the coffee machine.  
.ch mg  
How close is Professor Rogers to completing this machine?

I'm not sure, sir.  I don't think he's made much progress yet.

Come right this way, Sir.  You certainly are looking fine today.

Now, Peggy, you wouldn't be trying to butter me up, would you?  
.ch pb  
No, sir!  I'm just trying to treat you with the same courtesy and   
respect I show to all of our customers. 
.ch jt  
Maybe it's my imagination, but the staff seems just a little bit
more friendly on the day the employee of the month award is given out.  
.ch pb  
Oh, is it today?  It had completely slipped my mind.
.ch jt  
Don't worry, Peggy.  You're the most courteous employee we've ever  
had.  I don't see how I could give the award to anyone else.

I've got a plan!
We build a 5 million megaton atomic bomb and plant it in Professor  
Rogers' lab.  The resulting explosion will destroy Professor Rogers,
the machine, and all life on Earth!

.ch wb  
I have a better idea.   
We can help Professor Rogers complete his machine. Once the 
machine is completed, Rogers won't need any more money.

And the Bovine Commission won't have to eliminate either department.
.ch mg  
But how can we help Rogers with his machine?
.ch fm  
I'll attach my Frog Atomic Powered Flavour Enhancer.

Holy fresh roasted chicory, Frog Man, that's a great idea.

But isn't it dangerous?

No, it's perfectly safe.  Unless it's exposed to (SINISTER CHORD)

A rumble?  Of course not!

You know how it is, officers.  Sometimes people are happy and dancing.  
They bump into a chair or table.  It breaks.  You understand.

Of course...

What!  You can't marry her, Captain.  You're a superhero and she's a
supervillain.   
.ch bw  
It's all right.  We're both going to transfer to arts and take  
philosophy.  Questions of good and evil will be entirely academic.  
.ch mg  
Captain, you can't do this. 
.ch cu  
Why not sir?
.ch mg  
Because you have a responsibility to a higher cause.

Superheroes are not free, Captain.  
With great power comes great responsibility.
As long as evil remains in this world we
must fight it.  If we were to let down our guard for as much as 
one day we might lose the battle.  And if we lose, we lose forever. 
Each of us is called to let nothing stand in the way of our 
eternal struggle.  To give our all.  To fight, whatever the cost,   
for Truth, Freedom, Justice, and Fundamental Human Rights subject   
to reasonable restrictions imposed by a democratic society.
