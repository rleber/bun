.bs I 2 "PANDEMONIUM AT THE NEWSPAPER OFFICE"
(THE LIGHTS COME UP. THERE ARE TWO DESKS FRONT CENTRE, THE LEFT ONE
MESSY, COVERED WITH PILES OF CRUMPLED PAPER AND ASSORTED GARBAGE,
INCLUDING A CUP OF STALE COFFEE AND A BASEBALL CAP CONSPICUOUSLY
CROWNING THE MESS. THE OTHER DESK IS FANATICALLY (?) NEAT. 
THERE IS A GARBAGE PAIL STAGE LEFT OF IT. A MAN COMES 
UP CENTRE - JOCK MULLIGAN. HE IS NEATLY DRESSED IN A SHARP LOOKING SUIT
AND HAT. THERE IS A NEWSPAPER TUCKED UNDER HIS ARM. AS HE WALKS BETWEEN
THE TWO DESKS HE DEFTLY TOSSES THE PAPER ONTO THE NEAT DESK AND SENDS SEVERAL
THINGS FLYING ONTO THE FLOOR. HE DOES NOT NOTICE, BUT DROPS HIS HAT ON TOP
OF THE RACK, TAKES OFF HIS JACKET AND HANGS IT BY THE ARMPIT RATHER THAN
THE NAPE. HE CONTINUES BY LOOSENING HIS TIE COMPLETELY, PERHAPS LETTING IT 
SLIDE TO THE FLOOR. HE LOOSENS HIS SHIRT BUTTONS AND PULLS THE TAIL LOOSE--
HE IS WEARING A HEAVY GREY SWEATSHIRT UNDERNEATH.
JOCK MESSES HIS HAIR TO LOOK LIKE HE'S BEEN WORKING ALL NIGHT AND PICKS
UP THE PAPER. HE THEN STANDS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE AUDIENCE, SLOUCHED,
LOOKS BEWILDERED AT THE TWO DESKS, AS IF HE HAS FORGOTTEN SOMETHING. HE THEN
CASUALLY REACHES FOR THE CUP OF STALE COFFEE SITTING ON HIS DESK, AND
CAREFULLY POURS TWO DROPS ONTO THE PILE OF PAPERS FOR THE "LIVED-IN" LOOK.
(NOTE FOR THE TECH PEOPLE: THERE ARE ONLY TWO DROPS IN THE CUP
IN DEFERENCE TO THE PARQUET)
SATISFIED, HE SINKS INTO HIS CHAIR, PROPS ONE LEG ON TOP OF HIS DESK AND HIDES
HIMSELF BEHIND THE PAPER. WE READ
.ul
GANGLAND EXPOSE TOMORROW!
SPREAD ABSURDLY ACROSS BOTH PAGES.
"THE SUNDAY CHEVRON" IS SCRAWLED INEPTLY AT THE TOP OF THE PAPER.
AFTER A MOMENT ABBIE ROAD ENTERS. SHE TOO IS VERY NEATLY DRESSED. SHE PUTS
HER PURSE ON TOP OF THE OTHER DESK)
.ar
Good morning Jock. 
.sp
.ne4
(AFTER A SHORT SILENCE WE HEAR JOCK LOUDLY CLEAR
HIS SINUSES. ABBIE SIGHS AND PICKS UP THE THINGS THAT HAVE FALLEN
ON THE FLOOR. JOCK'S HEAD INDISCRETELY POPS FROM BEHIND THE PAPER
TO CATCH HIS EYES FULL OF ABBIE BENDING DOWN. HE OBVIOUSLY "DIGS"
ABBIE, BUT IS UNWILLING TO ADMIT IT. WHEN ABBIE TURNS AROUND, 
JOCK'S HEAD IS ONCE MORE BURIED FROM SIGHT)
.ar
"Gangland expose tomorrow"?
(SHE READS FROM JOCK'S PAPER) 
Rubbish!  No one reads the news anymore.
.jo
(MUMBLING) I read the news today.
.ar
Oh boy!  (PAUSE)  I tell you,
if it weren't for me, it'd be a wonder if anyone spent a lousy
dime on this paper at all. (SHE HOLDS UP A CHEVRON)
.jo
Hm?
.ar
Just look at the letters I get compared to everyone else.
(ABBIE TURNS TO THE FEEDBACK PAGE) "Dear Abbie Road;
I am a 12-yr-old nymphomaniac who likes to accost strangers on elevators
stopped between floors. Will this bring on an early menopause?"
Signed Naive.
.jo
(BELCHES)
.ar
Another one: "Dear Abbie Road:
I have been married for 11 years and 
have  discovered that the blonde hairs I keep finding on my
husband's collar belong to a goat. Should I sue for divorce?"
Signed Jealous.
(ABBIE REACTS TO THIS LETTER, TALKING TO THE PAPER AS IT WERE)
Well you stupid narrow-minded twit!  Your
husband is just undergoing the famous 11 year itch.
Ease him through this phase as gently as possible.
Bring up the subject tactfully; drop a head of lettuce into his
lunchbag. Probably he just wants a last fling with some wild
young creature.
Or perhaps he had a crush on his Nanny. (PAUSES) When he was a kid.
(PAUSES AGAIN)
Or maybe he's just trying to get your goat.
.jo
(STILL BEHIND PAPER) Bleh!
.ar
More of it comes in every day. (SHE OPENS A LETTER ON HER DESK)
"Dear Abbie; I am sick. I hate you. My brain hurts. I am trying
to kill you. Bye bye." (LOOKS UP WITHOUT REACTING TO THE LETTER)
There are filing cabinets crammed full of letters like that.
.jo
Hcfh.
.ar
(PICKS UP ANOTHER LETTER) "Dear Abbie:
I am a sportswriter
with a split personality. I do bizarre things at night and forget
that I've done them, like propositioning the bears in Waterloo
Park and writing this letter."
.sp
.ne2
(JOCK'S NEWSPAPER SLOWLY DRAPES OVER HIM AS HIS ARMS DROP)
.ar
"Tomorrow night I plan to climb to the top of the arts library
and set myself on fire. Please respond immediately." Signed--Mr Hyde.
That's funny. The handwriting looks familiar. 
.sp
.ne2
(JOCK'S NEWSPAPER SUDDENLY
FLIES INTO SHREDS AS HIS HANDS TRY TO KNOCK IT AWAY. FINALLY HIS
.ne3
FACE EMERGES, AGHAST. HIS FINGERS FREEZE, CLAWING HIS FACE IN CONTORTED
MELODRAMATIC HORROR. ABBIE CANNOT SEE THIS SINCE SHE IS STANDING
IN FRONT OF HER DESK, FACING THE AUDIENCE)
.ar
I wonder who it could be.
.sp
.ne3
(SOUNDS OF LAUGHTER AND LOUD VOICES. EDITOR, JIMMY MOLSON AND
LOTUS LANE ENTER CHATTING FROM ORSON'S OFFICE LEFT)
.ar
Uh-oh, it's the boss with Tweedledum and Tweedledee.
.jm
(BUBBLING) Gee boss, that's really swell, huh boss?
.lo
(FLATLY) Wow!
.jm
Gee! Huh, Boss, huh?
.ob
(LOOKS AT JIMMY A BIT LEARILY) Jimmy, why don't you go and play
in the traffic? (COMPLETE CHANGE IN EXPRESSION FOR ABBIE)
Abbie!  Great day, isn't it?
(HE BEAMS AT HER)
.ar
What's the excitement?  Someone spike your geritol?
Put uppers in your Wheaties?
.ob
Haven't you seen the morning paper? They're going like hotcakes!     
We're going to smash mobster city wide open!
We're going to make the name Orson Buggy as famous as ...
Joe Clark.
.ar
Joe who?
.jm
Gee boss, you sure got a way with words!
.ob
I'm the boss, I get away with everything.  (SHOWS ABBIE A LARGE
MANILLA ENVELOPE) This little document here is the hottest
scoop this paper ever had.
.lo
It's the only scoop this paper ever had.  The ladies
in the cafeteria serve ice cream with their fingers.
.ar
And everyone knows fingers should be served separately.
.jm
And just remember this expose is all due to your ace
reporters, Lotus Lane and Jimmy Molson.
.ob
(SUDDENLY) JOCK!
.jo
(HE HAS BEEN IN HIS TRANCE UNTIL NOW) Eh?
.ob
(TO ABBIE) What's wrong with him? (ABBIE LOOKS AT JOCK, THEN SHRUGS)
.ar
Jock always looks a little strapped.
.ob
(WALKS OVER TO JOCK) What's wrong with you?
.jo
(BLINKS) Wa?
.ob
The poor slob's been working all night. He's exhausted! (THROWS
ENVELOPE ON ABBIE'S DESK. PULLS OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND PATS JOCK'S
FOREHEAD) Jimmy!
.jm
(JUMPS TO EDITOR'S AID) Yes boss! Anything you want boss?
Right away boss!
.ob
Get Jock a glass of water. (JIMMY DASHES OFF RIGHT) 
Abbie! This gangster story is going to be the biggest scandal ever
to hit this city. At least you could work up a bit of enthusiasm.
.ar
I thought Jimmy had enough for all of us.
.sp
.ne2
(DURING THIS JOCK LOOKS AROUND AND STARTS TO MAKE PAPER AIRPLANES)
.ob
Abbie, when are you going to get rid of that cockeyed notion that you're
the only thing holding this paper together?
.ar
On the day I see more than three letters-to-the-editor that aren't
written by your wife's quilting club.
.ob
But Abbie, listen to what we've found out about gang activity
in the city.  Tell 'er Lotus.
.lo
Well, there's these two gangs, see, the Wine Gang who are
all named after wines ...
.ar
Do tell.
.lo
And the Cheese gang ...
.ar
Don't tell me - they're all named after cheeses.
.lo
Right, and they've got a stranglehold on everything!
The Cheese gang has a movie studio as a front ...
.ar
What do they have as a back?
.lo
... and the Wine gang owns a gambling joint ...
.ar
Haven't the police managed to smoke
.ul
them
out?
.lo
The police!  There's a special squad of Federal
Investigators looking into the rackets, but these Feds
are so corrupt and incompetent ...
.ob
(INTERRUPTING)
Isn't this the greatest story you ever heard?  And it's
going in my paper starting tomorrow.
.ar
(GLARING AT ORSON WHO IS TOO HAPPY TO SUIT HER TASTES)
Looking at your nose, Orson, reminds me I have to cut the
grass.
.ob
Cut the grass?  Oh, Abbie, you're such a dope!
(HE STOMPS OFF TO OFFICE, STAGE LEFT)
.lo
Wait for me!
(SHE FOLLOWS ORSON OUT LEFT)
.ar
(SEES EXPOSE) What's this??
(SHE PICKS IT UP AND SEES EXPOSE WRITTEN ALL OVER IT)
Oh!  (THE FOLLOWING SPEECH
IS SLOW AND DELIBERATE) Gee--could it be fan-mail? No, it looks too
official. It's probably from Max Saltzman. (SHE LOOKS 
TEMPTEDLY AT THE GARBAGE PAIL) Maybe I should open it to be sure.
But, gosh, it doesn't have my name on it--and everybody knows it's
illegal to open somebody else's mail. 
(PAUSE)
Unless you're a mountie.  
(SEES JOCK SEND OFF A PAPER AIRPLANE)
(NORMAL VOICE) Hey, Jock!
Mail for you.
.sp
.ne5
(ABBIE TOSSES THE
ENVELOPE ON HIS DESK. JOCK LOOKS AT IT FOR A MOMENT, PICKS
IT UP, AND BEGINS TO MAKE AN AIRPLANE OUT OF IT. JIMMY COMES IN RIGHT,
SLOUCHED AND MUTTERING, CARRYING A GLASS OF WATER. JOCK STOPS TO WATCH
HIM AND LICKS HIS LIPS)
.ar
(CONDESCENDINGLY) Jimmy, poor boy--whatever's the matter with you?
.jm
(STOPS BETWEEN DESKS. POINTS TO EDITOR'S OFFICE OFFSTAGE LEFT)
Star cub reporter, and I still have to run errands.
(JOCK IS TRYING TO REACH FOR  THE GLASS OF WATER)
I'd be better off as a Federation fieldworker - they
don't have to do anything ... (PAUSE) ... like this.
(DRINKS WATER HIMSELF
TO JOCK'S DISMAY)
.ob
(OFFSTAGE LEFT) JIMMY!
.jm
Coming, boss! (HURRIES OFF LEFT. JOCK LOOKS FRUSTRATED)
.ar
(SHE RUFFLES JOCK'S HAIR AS IF PATTING A DOG) That's alright,
Jock, there will be other glasses of water.
(JOCK ANGRILY THROWS THE MANILLA AIRPLANE DOWN CENTRE.
WE HEAR AN AGONIZED SHRIEK)
.cf
(ENTERS FROM VOM BRINGING BACK EXPOSE) Allo dere. Maybe you loose dis?
.ar
(SNATCHES BACK EXPOSE AND TOSSES IT TO JOCK) Curses! Foiled again!
.cf
(TO ABBIE) Allo dere, cutie. Maybe I innerest you in a fireproof wig?
(PULLS A MOPHEAD OUT OF HIS BAG) Den you can stick your
head inna oven midout goin POOF!
.ar
Get lost, creep.
.cf
(TO JOCK) You need a fireproof vig? (DANGLES IT IN JOCK'S FACE)
.ar
Leave the poor sod alone.
.cf
Hey! You sure gotta nice pair a legs! You vant some acid-proof
high-heeled army boots? Look real nice on you.
.ar
Skoot, kiddo!
.cf
I see dis here a noospapper office. You need some invisible
typewriter ribbons? Don't make mistakes.
.ar
Skedaddle, buster.
.cf
Got lotsa fireproof tings: fireproof matches, cigarettes,
gasoline, charcoal. Vanna buy an electric comb? An electric
book-mark? A vaterproof sponge? You vanna buy a better
mousetrap? (HOLDS UP A LARGE DOOHICKEY. ABBIE STARES AT
HIM, UNIMPRESSED) No, huh? (TO JOCK) Vat about you,
fella? You should see vat dese high-heeled army boots do
for your figger! (JOCK YAWNS) Boy, you sure are an unfrien  q    
