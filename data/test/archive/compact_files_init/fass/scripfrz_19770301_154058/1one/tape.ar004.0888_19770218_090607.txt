*************************************
***to the tune of "Comedy Tonight"***
*************************************
Something amusing, something confusing,
Something for everyone:  a travesty tonight;
Some things are aimless, some things are shameless,
Something for everyone:  a travesty tonight;
Nothing that's dense, nothing intense;
Nothing that even seems to make sense.
Some jokes are oldies, some jokes are mouldies,
Written by folks who couldn't write,
Comedy tomorrow, travesty tonight.

Some parts are gifted, some parts are lifted,
Something from everyone, a travesty tonight.
Num, num, etc.
Something num, num, num, num, a travesty tonight.
Something verbose, something that's gross,
Even the acting seems comatose.
Old situations, Serbo-Croatians,
Ethnic minorities delight...
Prejudice tomorrow, travesty tonight.

Something that's foolish, something that's ghoulish,
Something insidious:  a travesty tonight.
Something that's tricky, something that's sticky,
Something perfidious:  a travesty tonight.
Nothing obscene, nothing that's clean,
All of the humour fits in between,
We're out for laughter, that's what we're after,
We hope that you will prove us right,
Comedy tomorrow, travesty tonight.
