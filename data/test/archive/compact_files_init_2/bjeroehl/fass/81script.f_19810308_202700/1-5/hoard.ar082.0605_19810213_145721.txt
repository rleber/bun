Oh, and here's a weapon that's capable of instantly putting
huge crowds of people into a drug-like stupor.

Statistics.

This stuff sounds tremendous.

And there are only three more groups of spies left to report.

It's all beginning to pull together.
You're doing a good job, team.

Hey boss, look at this!

(THE RESEARCHERS CROWD AROUND AS PHIL, ANNA, AND LES ENTER.)
.ch pt
Well, Les, your people better have something to report.
The personnel department has been having kittens over the
expense accounts from the insurance people and the spies.
.ch ld
It can't be that bad, boss.
After all, the spies can steal
whatever they want, and what does an insurance agent need?
.ch pt 
Read the list, Anna.
.ch as
(READING A LIST DEADPAN) Expense accounts:
One large pizza with pepperoni, peanut butter, double banana,
double anchovies, yogurt, 23 frisbee guns, 2 boxes of ammunition, 36 pairs
of boffer glasses, 10 Tom Mix secret decoder rings, and 1389 co-op students.
.ch ld
Who could eat a pizza with 1389 co-op students on it?
.ch pt
Dewitt, do you expect this company to pay for all that nonsense?
.ch ld
Boss, if we want results, we have to put up with these little peculiarities.
.ch pt 
Are we getting results?
.ch ld
We brought you here so that R&D team could tell you
personally what progress they've made.
.ch as
What! You let that group of morons work on this?
They had absolutely no workable ideas before...
.ch ld 
Well, the team is like a bunch of engineers -- they'll
never come up with anything original, but if someone gives them an
idea, they can follow it through to its logical conclusion.
.ch pt
My logical conclusion will be to fire the lot of you if this doesn't work.
.ch ld 
No problem boss, you'll love what we've got.  I hope.
(TO RESEARCHERS)  Okay team, attenhut!

(THE SCIENTISTS SNAP TO ATTENTION.)

Yes sir!

Well, we've got...

Lasers and Phasers and nuclear weapons
Miniature landmines that you'll love to step on
Fiendish devices that blow you to bits

Hand grenades, light sabres, aren't they just neat-o?

Sounds good. Is that it?

We're just waiting for the last three groups to report. After we incorporate
their information, it should take about a month before the first units can be

Good, good.

Whatever.

You'd be amazed at what we've learned.
.ch ri
For example, they say that the country is run by P.E.T.
.ch wp
It's a little confusing but we think it's a Commodore PET microcomputer.
.ch ld
They use a microbrain to run the country?
.ch qp
Hard to believe, isn't it?
.ch kb
Not only that, but there's a lot
of doubt about who's leading the opposition.
.ch ld
What do you mean?
.ch fr
When we asked "Who leads the Opposition?", they just said "Yes."

And the country is ripping apart at the seams.

You people look awful! What happened?
.ch yd
It was pretty rough dere.
We got caught in da act and had to shoot hour way hout.
.ch ca 
It was a good thing those insurance agents showed up when the
shooting started, or we'd all look like Swiss cheese.
.ch ms
Insurance agents? What were they doing there?
.ch kp
It must have something to do with the policies they sold us.
Anyway, they brought in some co-op bullet catchers and pulled us out.

Bullet Catcher -- that reminds me of some of the jobs I
got when I was in Co-op Espionage Studies.

You were in Espionage Studies?  Hey, I was in ES too.

You were in ES2?  I didn't even think it was built yet.

my
first job interview.
All we knew was that the
interviewer was hidden in a room somewhere in the northern hemisphere.
The first one to find the room got the job.
.ch ms
I applied for that job, but I didn't get it.
The room was in the Psychology building.
.ch yd
How did anyone find da room?
.ch dm
No one did.  They ended up hiring a monkey.
.ch ms
Right.

Wright?  Yes, I believe that was the monkey's name.

And the school terms weren't any better than the jobs.

Our graduating class had an interesting assignment from the student government
We were hired to eliminate some fanatical left wing radicals who were 
publishing a silly newspaper.
It wasn't hard, we just took them to the South Campus Hall cafeteria.
.ch rr
Wow, we didn't study Cruel and Unusual Punishment until Grad School.
.ch ca
Well we decided it was kind of nasty too, so we took them to
Health Services to get their stomachs pumped.  When the operation
was finished, the radicals said they would only pay last year's
medical fees, so the doctors pumped back 7 1/2%.
