Ummm.... Excuse me. I'm supposed to meet a friend in the Campus Centre.
This is the Great Hall, isn't it?

Actually, it's not that great. You must be a frosh.

THAT READS: "BAN THE CORSET -- DON'T ENDORSE IT")
.ch ann
Oh, Anita, there you are. Sorry I'm late but the corset burning went on
longer than expected. Speaking of which, why are you dressed like
that?  Women have spent months protesting for the right to dress as
they wish, and here you are, jumping into the pitfalls of societal
norms!
.ch ani
But this is how I WANT to dress.
.ch ann
Anita, this isn't about how you want to dress. The feminist
movement EXPECTS you to dress a certain way, and if you go and buckle
under to societal pressure, you're letting us all down... (SUDDENLY
NOTICES Guy)  By the way, who's the sperm bank?

Oh, sorry. Anne, this is... ummmm...

My name is Guy.

Hey, Guy! Sorry, we were late getting out of French Culture class.
.ch guy
Oh, yeah? What are the people in France doing these days?
.ch ian
They're revolting.
(A BEAT)
But I've heard talk about bringing over that French corporal as a
guest speaker... what was his name?
.ch lew
Napoleon Bonaparty! ... uh ... Bonaportay. Bona Porter Library!
.ch ian
Napoleon is an officer on the way up.
They want him to lecture to our class.
.ch guy
Do you think he'll come to Waterloo?
.ch ian
Why not? It's not going to kill him.
.ch lew
Borneopart? Part Bono? Part the Edge? Part the Red Sea?
.ch ian
The good news is that for the final exam, we have to memorize the names
of the French nobility.
.ch guy
Why is that good?
.ch ian
The list keeps getting shorter and shorter.

Blownapart!!
.ch ian
No, they use a guillotine.

Anyway, Claude, this is Anita, and her friend Anne. (TO Anita) I was wondering
if you two want to go dancing, or something. It's baroque-and-roll night at the
Bombshelter.
.ch ani
Well, actually, we were going to watch Opera Gratis.

Oh. I see. Well, maybe some other time.

You could watch it with us.

Oh, I'm sorry. I was looking for Notre Dame.

No, you see, in the Catholic residences, they have prefects. We call
ourselves dons.

And why is that?

Well, nobody's prefect.

Why are you looking for Notre Dame College, anyway?

Maybe he's a creature of habit.

Wait a minute!  What's that black and white thing?

No, you've got it all wrong.  It's "what's black and white and red all

No, no, no. Look.  Over there.

It's a sleepwalking nun.  She must be wandering all over campus.

because...
.ch ann
Shut up.  I'd rather listen to Larry, Curly and Mozart. (INDICATES ACTORS)
.ch guy
(TO SELF) Gee, look at them up there.  They're so talented and sure of
themselves.  I bet women really go for that sort of thing.  Maybe I can
lower my voice and comb my hair to look like Don Giovanni.

(TO Guy) Look at those self-righteous, smug idiots.  They honestly think
women fall for that sort of thing.

Why not?

Let's just say I have a hunch.

You look very familiar.

Oh, yes. Of course.

No.

It's not easy being bent,
Hoping the world won't notice your shape,
And knowing that people will cross a great desert,
  walk a mile for a camel,
But they won't walk with me.

It isn't easy being bent,
Seeing shoes instead of the skies,
And wondering whether, for a moment, anybody
Will see love in my eyes.

Has its perqs, though it's strange.
Cause with your ear to the pavement,

You find more loose change.

You've got to roll with the punch,
Keep rising, keep shining.

(TO Guy) So are you going steady with her now?

You must always be very careful about what you say and how you act.
Remember these three things: Never talk about past girlfriends;
never be the first one to say "I love you"; and, no matter what
happens, never let them see you sweat.
.ch ani
(TO Anne) I really think he's attracted to me.
.ch ann
He's a man. Of course he's attracted.  He's ruled by his hormones.

No, I really think he likes me. I think he wants a serious
relationship.
.ch ann
What he wants is sex.
.ch ani
Well, maybe I want to have sex with him, too.

We still live in a society that holds on to outdated chauvinistic
dogma. If you make the first move, he'll think you're a tramp.
