ENTER.  THEY  CAN  NEITHER  SPEAK  NOR  STAND, SO THEY SPEND
THEIR TIME KNUCKLING ABOUT THE STAGE, PLAYING GAMES TO  WARD
OFF  BOREDOM.  NO  ONE  USES THUMBS. SUGGESTED GAMES: STONE,

MEMBER OF THE OPPOSITE SEX, SUGGESTING  THAT  THEY  RUB  AND
BANG  EACH  OTHER  TOGETHER.  THIS IS MET WITH THE MIMED AND
GRUNTED RESPONSE OF "NOT TONIGHT, I  HAVE  A  HEADACHE  FROM
WHERE I WAS HIT WITH THE CLUB.")

.ve 4
Do you hear the distant drum, sounding the rise of early man?
Why don't you join us now and witness how our history began?
Ev'ry scholar here today descended from people such as these,
See how the winds of change began as a gentle breeze.
.ve 4
We will take you on a journey through the merry days of yore,
So prepare yourselves for revelry,
    there's lots of laughs in store,
If we're any good you'll be rolling about on the floor.
.ve 4
Join the steady march of years, follow the path of history,
Start at the primal dawn and travel on to ages yet to be,
With the wisdom of the past filling up our curriculums,
There will be many things to learn when tomorrow comes.
.ve 4
The survival of the fittest will allow us to progress,
And intelligence will triumph over muscular prowess,
If that were not true we would all be in H-K-L-S.
    (Dum-dum-dum-dum!)
.ve 5
Join the steady march of years, follow the path of history,
Ev-ery lowly undergrad and ev'ry lofty P.h.D.,
And to think it all begins with the opposing of our thumbs,
There will be many things to learn when tomorrow comes.
    (Dum-de-dum!)

THUMBS  IN  MIMICRY  OF THE MODERNS, WONDERING. AFTER MAKING
THE CONNECTION, SHE CALMS THE CROWD, AND THEY SIT)

(Alice  TRIES  TO  TELL  THEM  WHAT  SHE  KNOWS,  BY GRUNTING,
WIGGLING  HER  THUMB,  POINTING,   ET   CETERA.   THEY   ARE
ENTHRALLED,  BUT  DON'T  GET  THE  POINT,  SO  SHE DOES IT IN
CHARADES. THE CROWD WARMS  TO  THIS  AND  OFFERS  GRUNTS  IN
REPLY.  SHE  SELECTS  SOME  GRUNTS, REJECTS OTHERS, AND WORKS
HER WAY THROUGH THE CHARADE. Neil FIGURES IT  OUT  GETS  THE
CROWD'S  ATTENTION.  HE  PULLS  OUT A LIGHTER AND LIGHTS IT.
THE CROWD GATHERS ROUND TO  WARM  THEMSELVES,  AND  TRY  IT.
AFTER  A  BRIEF  PAUSE  FOR  REFLECTION, THEY UNDERSTAND THE
CHARADE AND GRUNT OUT  THE  ANSWER  IN  UNISON.  Alice  LEAPS
UPRIGHT, AND SHOUTS)

This is quite a discovery!

What a momentous day for humanity!

Pity the weather couldn't have been better.

.ch og
It's probably just a fad.

.ch alice
(SHOUTING ABOVE THE DIN, HOLDING ALOFT THE LIGHTER)
Wait!  We shouldn't just keep this to ourselves!  We should
teach everyone about this.

.ch og
Why?

.ch terry
To keep our friends and neighbours from perishing in the cold.

.ch rex
Great, five minutes into humanity and already we're talking
social democracy.

.ad
(MURMURS FROM THE CROWD)

.ch astral
But how could we spread this learning?

.ch alice
Create a university!

.ch neil
But things aren't just created, they evolve!

.ch rex
How would you like me to evolve your face?

.ch terry
Go take a long walk off a short life-span.

.ch thag
Stuff a rock in it, will you?
What I wanna know is, what is a university?

.ch terry
A college without shop classes.

.ad
(NOISES OF UNDERSTANDING: "Oh, oh, I see.", "Yeah, right", ETC)

.ch thag
Where would we build such a thing?

.ch alice
Over there, in the swamp.

.ch og
The mastodon swamp?

.ch astral
You mean that awful place where unsuspecting creatures
wander in, and become mired forever in stinking muck?

.ch rex
Don't you think that's appropriate?

.sb "Progress" "Dear World"
.sl og
What is the point of this progress?
Who are you trying to impress?
I'm prehistoric; my world is made of stone.
Don't try to fix it, leave it alone.

So drop these pretensions of knowledge,
I'm staying here, not at college.
I am a happy, uneducated lout,
So count your blessings,
  And count me out!
.sl alice
Don't get your nose out of joint, Og.
You seem to miss the whole point, Og.
Our evolution is unavoidable.
Jump on the wagon, help us to pull.
.ve 5
EVERYONE:
So teach to the whole human race, Og.
(The) future's a wonderful place, Og.
We're getting ready to shoot for something new,
To build a campus, at Waterloo.
.ve 4
  If we think logically,
  And act accordingly,
  Then there is gonna be,
  A University!
.ve 4
We've got to have education:
Hedging against glaciation.
And if your mind is becoming rather numb,
Help us to plan the curriculum.
.ve 7
'Cause we have to chart out our classes,
(Which) frees us from freezing our asses.
It's far too chilly to stand here turning blue,
  So build a campus,
    A magnificent campus,
      A remarkable campus,
        At Waterloo!

OK, so now you've got your university, what are you going
to do?

.ch alice
I think I'd like to study Philosophy.

.ch astral
Poetry and Literature...

.ch thag
(LECHEROUSLY)
Human Anatomy!

.ch terry
Ethics and Social Reform...

.ch neil
Creative Evolution --

.ch rex
Oh, go jump in the gene pool.

.ch alice
Before this evolves into something unpleasant,
don't we have a class now?

Ah, Civil Engineering.
