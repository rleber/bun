   (INDICATING THEM) All our scribes, ahead full speed;
   But we seem doomed not to succeed.

4-BACON:

   My good Othello Gutenberg, pray how
   Would you suggest we meet our deadline now.

5-OTHELLO:

   Sir Francis, I am at a loss to say.
   What I would do to know the secret held
   By the Gazette, whose paper is produced
   In time so short that it doth trick the eye.

6-SHAKESPEARE:  Perhaps some magic secret they possess.

7-OTHELLO:

   A magic, yes, whose name be Juliet
   The copy editor of the Gazette;
   By cunning she produced a scribe so swift
   As never has been matched by man nor beast.

(Bacon  OBVIOUSLY  COVETS  THE SUPER SCRIBE, AND Shakespeare
CATCHES THIS.)

8-SHAKESPEARE:   (SARCASTICALLY)  Perhaps,  Sir  Bacon,  you
   could steal this gem.

9-BACON:

   Now you should talk, good William Shakespeare, "friend";
   Did we not form a partnership to write
   A weekly column, name of "Shake and Bake"?
   (INDICATING THE COLUMN IN AN ISSUE)
   And tell me, whose good name appears alone?
   No "Francis Bacon", only "Shakespeare" shown.

10-SHAKESPEARE:

   Enough expository introductions!
   I never saw such writing so unskilled
   That characters were introduced like this.
