   late but the corset burning went on longer than expected.
   Speaking  of which, why are you dressed like that?  Women
   have spent months protesting for the right  to  dress  as
   they wish, and here you are, jumping into the pitfalls of
   societal norms!

8-ANITA(3):  But this is how I WANT to dress.

9-ANNE(2):  Anita, this isn't about how you want  to  dress.
   The feminist movement EXPECTS you to dress a certain way,
   and if you go and  buckle  under  to  societal  pressure,
   you're  letting us all down... (SUDDENLY NOTICES Guy)  By

   It's not easy being bent,
   Hoping the world won't notice your shape,
   And knowing that people will cross a great desert,
     walk a mile for a camel,
   But they won't walk with me.

   It isn't easy being bent,
   Seeing shoes instead of the skies,
   And wondering whether, for a moment, anybody
   Will see love in my eyes.

   But being low to the ground,
   Has its perqs, though it's strange.
   Cause with your ear to the pavement,
    and your eye to the gutter,
   You find more loose change.

   Keep rising, keep shining.

103-ANITA(11):   (TO  Anne) I really think he's attracted to
   me.

104-ANNE(7):  He's a man. Of course  he's  attracted.   He's
   ruled by his hormones.

105-ANITA(12):   No,  I really think he likes me. I think he
   wants a serious relationship.

106-ANNE(8):  What he wants is sex.

107-ANITA(13):  Well, maybe I want to  have  sex  with  him,
   too.

108-ANNE(9):   We  still  live in a society that holds on to
   outdated chauvinistic dogma. If you make the first  move,
   he'll think you're a tramp.

109-ANITA(14):   Maybe  I  can  drop hints then.  (ADDRESSES
   Guy) So, do you wear pyjamas to bed?

110-ANNE(10):  Subtle. Really subtle.

[L-7] (LIGHTS BACK UP ON "PERFORMANCE AREA". LIGHTS LOWER ON L
"GREAT HALL")


111-OTTOMODO(9):  Stay back.  (HE'S STILL HOLDING Clara)

112-MORTY(17):  If you harm a hair on her body,  I'll  break
   every bone in your head...

113-D.GIOVANNI(8):   Stand  back, Morty -- I'll handle this.
   All right, Hunchback.  I challenge you to a duel...

114-OTTOMODO(10):   Very  well.   I  choose   the   weapons.
   Swords.

115-D.GIOVANNI(9):  Bring me my foil.

(Morty  BRINGS IN TWO FOILS.  Don Giovanni AND THE Hunchback
BEGIN TO FENCE.   WITH  A  BIT  OF  COMIC  CHOREOGRAPHY,  WE
QUICKLY  ESTABLISH THAT Don Giovanni IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE
Hunchback)

116-OTTOMODO(11):  You're pretty good.

117-D.GIOVANNI(10):  Captain of the  Fencing  team  for  the
   last three years.

118-OTTOMODO(12):  Did I say 'swords'?  What was I thinking?
   I meant bow and arrow.  (DISCARDS HIS SWORD)

119-D.GIOVANNI(11):  I teach archery in my spare time.

120-OTTOMODO(13):  Bullwhip?

(GIOVANNI'S Girlfriends ALL GIGGLE WILDLY)

121-OTTOMODO(14):  No, never mind.  Quarterstaff?

122-D.GIOVANNI(12):   Actually, I don't think I've ever used
   a quarterstaff before.

123-OTTOMODO(15):  Aha!  Quarterstaff it is,  then.   (PICKS
   UP  A  STAFF)   Ho.  Ha.  Dodge.   Parry.   Spin.  Feint.
   Thrust.  (HE MANAGES TO KNOCK  HIMSELF  OUT  A  LA  DAFFY
   DUCK)

124-MORTY(18):  You did it!  Clara is free!  (HE UNTIES HER)

111222555-CCCLLLAAARRRAAA FFFIIIDDDEEE(111):   How  can  I  ever  thank you?  You were
   really wonderful.

126-D.GIOVANNI(13):  That's what all the girls say.

127-MORTY(19):  Well... I guess we should  go  now.   Thanks
   again.

128-D.GIOVANNI(14):  Just a moment.

(Don Giovanni GRABS Clara AND KISSES HER PASSIONATELY)

[M-3] (A FEW BARS OF "ROMEO AND JULIET")                     M

129-CLARA(2):  I was hoping you'd do that.

130-D.GIOVANNI(15):   If  I hadn't, you would have regretted
   it.  Maybe not today.  Maybe not tomorrow. But soon.  And
   for the rest of your life.

131-CLARA(3):  Oh, Don Giovanni, I love you.

132-D.GIOVANNI(16):  Me too.

   We beat the Hunchback expertly
   And so, I'm sure you'll all agree
   That evil always pays a price
   And Ottomodo wasn't nice.
   Yet still you may be sure my friends
   Although it seems this story ends
   All of us have bills to pay
   So we'll return another day!

   Biceps and thighs!
   The hero always gets the chicks.
   Evil bad guys
   Always up to dirty tricks.
   And we actors
   Are off to make a sequel now
   Off to make a sequel now
   A sequel now, a sequel now, a sequel!

(TWO  ACTORS  DRESSED AS TECHIES COME ONTO STAGE WITH A LONG
SCROLL COVERED  WITH  ACTORS'  NAMES,  AND  THEY  "ROLL  THE
CREDITS".  LIGHTS UP ON "GREAT HALL" AND DOWN ON "STAGE")

133-TURNKEY(2):   Thank  you for coming out to Opera Gratis.
   The turnkeys will tell you where the furniture goes.   If
   you  enjoyed  tonight's  show,  be sure to come back next
   Tuesday, when we present "1002: A Sea Odyssey".

(PEOPLE BEGIN TO CLEAR OUT, VERY QUICKLY AT THE  MENTION  OF
MOVING  FURNITURE.  NONETHELESS, SOME POOR HAPLESS SOULS CAN
BE SEEN THROUGH TO THE END OF THE  SCENE  MOVING  PIECES  OF
FURNITURE AROUND THE STAGE, AND PERHAPS OFF-STAGE)

134-CLAUDE(9):   (ROMANTICALLY,  TO Anne)  You know, I can't
   help but notice that it's been some time since  you  last
   spouted  some  misguided feminist rhetoric.  Would you be
   interested in going out sometime?

135-ANNE(11):  Oh, please.  Spare  me.   They  say  love  is
   blind, but deaf, dumb, and unable to smell?

136-CLAUDE(10):  Oh, well.  Perhaps some other time?

137-ANNE(12):   Look,  the only reason I'd ever get close to
   you is to reach down your throat and pull out your heart,
   so  that  I  could  toss it into a corner and dance on it
   with hob-nailed boots. Then I'd stick the whole thing  in
   an  oven  and cook the stuffing out of it, cut it up into
   little pieces, serve it to you on toast and expect you to
   say "Gee, thanks. It's delicious." Got it?

138-CLAUDE(11):    All   right.   It's   a   date!   (LEAVES
   ECSTATICALLY)

(Anne JOINS Guy, Lewis AND Anita)

139-GUY(18):   I  was  kind of wondering... (HE TAKES A STEP
   CLOSER TO Anita, AND Lewis DOES LIKEWISE,  REMAINING  TOO
   CLOSE  FOR  INTIMATE  CONVERSATION.   Guy  TURNS  TO FACE
   Lewis)  Hey, Lewis, why don't you go get popcorn for next
   week's  show.  The line-up is probably pretty short right
   now.

140-LEWIS(8):  Hey, that's a great idea! (HE EXITS)

141-GUY(19):  (TO Anita) I was kind of wondering if... if  I
   could have your phone number.

142-ANITA(15):   I'm  still on the waiting list. It won't be
   installed until 1903.

143-GUY(20):  Oh. Look, I really  want  to  see  you  again.
   Just being around you, I get this funny feeling ...

144-ANNE(13):  Saltpeter can take care of that.

145-ANITA(16):  Well, maybe we'll bump into each other again
   sometime.

146-ANNE(14):  Well, I'm sure it was nice meeting you,  Guy,
   but  Anita and I have to get going now, or we'll miss the
   Safety Carriage.

147-GUY(21):  (HE ONLY HAS EARS FOR Anita) Maybe we could go
   out and get a coffee or something.

148-ANNE(15):   Don't  you  remember,  Anita?  You have that
   really BIG assignment to do...

149-ANITA(17):  Why don't you go on ahead? I think Guy  will
   walk me home.

150-ANNE(16):  All right, but remember what I said. A farmer
   isn't going to buy a cow if he can get the milk for free.
   (SHE EXITS)

151-GUY(22):  So, did you want to go out and get a doughnut?

152-ANITA(18):  Well, actually, doughnuts make my brown eyes
   blue.

(LONG, UNCOMFORTABLE PAUSE)

153-GUY(23):  So, do you, ... that is... do you have a  boy-
   friend?

154-ANITA(19):  I did, but he was a jerk... I mean, I've got
   nothing against jerks. You're not a jerk, are you?

155-GUY(24):  I gave it up for lent.

(VERY CASUALLY, THEY BEGIN TO GET CLOSER, LOCK ARMS, ETC)

156-ANITA(20):  Sorry you and Anne didn't hit it off.

157-GUY(25):   What  is  her problem? Did her parents lose a
   bet with God?

158-ANITA(21):   No,  she  just  thinks  that  men  are  im-
   perialistic  oppressors  who only think with one of their
   heads.

159-GUY(26):   I'm  surprised  that  she  doesn't  see  more
   castrati opera.

(Guy  AND  Anita  SIT ON THE BACK OF A COUCH WHICH IS FACING
AWAY FROM THE AUDIENCE)

160-ANITA(22):  (STARRY-EYED AND SEXUALLY  CHARGED)  I  hope
   you found this opera...  stimulating.

161-GUY(27):  I did. Especially the... climax...

162-ANITA(23):  Shut up and kiss me.

(Guy  AND Anita ENGAGE IN A PASSIONATE EMBRACE. Lewis ENTERS
WITH POPCORN.  Guy and Anita  FALL  OVER  THE  BACK  OF  THE
COUCH,  LEAVING ONLY THEIR LEGS VISIBLE. Lewis MOVES UPSTAGE
OF THE COUCH, WATCHING THE EVENTS ON THE COUCH  UNFOLD,  AND
QUIETLY EATS HIS POPCORN)
