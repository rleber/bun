111-PPPRRROOOFFFEEESSSSSSOOORRR:  Good evening, class.  This course is  FASSical
   Studies,  or  as some of my students last year called it:
   Hunks o' History.

   You all have the course outline in front of you (HOLDS UP
   PROGRAM).  If you turn to page 3 you will see that 40% of
   the course will be studied before  the  midterm  and  30%
   afterwards.  There is no final, and bribing the professor
   is encouraged.

   Call me old fashioned but I ask that  you  do  not  bring
   food  or  drinks  to lectures as I find them distracting.
   The same can be said for  cigarettes.  Cameras  and  tape
   recorders  are also forbidden, as the course is available
   from Correspondence already and I don't want to cut  down
   on my royalty income.

   This  course is an examination of the creation and evolu-
   tion of the University of Waterloo and its parallels with
   the  evolution  of  western  civilization,  if  the  term
   civilization can be given  to  a  society  that  includes
   engineering.

   I  will  be  making extensive use of audio-visual aids in
   teaching this course. I may also take  advantage  of  the
   wide  variety  of experts on faculty by bringing in guest
   lecturers.

   As time is short, let's get started right away, shall we?

   To start off tonight, I would like to introduce a  former
   Dean of Math who has gone on to bigger and better things.
   Dr. Jim Kalbfleish, Associate Provost.

222-JJJIIIMMM KKKAAALLLBBBFFFLLLEEEIIISSSHHH:  What is a  University?   There  are  many
   answers  to that question.  Some say it is a place to ex-
   plore man's intrest in the arts.  I beleive it is a place
   to  develop  man's intellect.  Intelligence is one of the
   paradoxes of our evolution.  Knowledge threw  us  out  of
   the Garden of Eden, yet knowledge is what lets us enter a
   university.  It seems to me that a University is a fairly
   contrived  notion.   Where  did  the  idea  of  gathering
   learned people together to teach come from?  I  take  you
   now  to  the  dawn  of  man, or maybe five minutes before
   dawn.

111-PPPRRROOOFFFEEESSSSSSOOORRR:    Thus  the  first  of  the  universities  was
   founded. In their early years universities  were  violent
   and  self-serving places. "Every man for himself" was the
   prevalent attitude. People thought  nothing  of  stabbing
   colleagues  in the back and taking credit for their work.
   Come to think of it, not much has changed.   And  it  all
   seems  rather  silly,  doesn't  it, when you realize that
   university politics are so vicious because the stakes are
   so  small. Now, the fighting was not restricted to within
   the campus. Universities fought each other on  the  field
   of  battle.   Again  not much has changed except that the
   war is now fought on the  football  field.   One  of  the
   Great  Wars  was fought between Troy and Athens, or as we
   know them today, Waterloo and Wilfrid  Laurier.   Let  us
   take a look at the causes of this epic struggle.

   the  ages  with  Laurier usually coming out on top.  This
   year, however, was different as our Warriors of  Waterloo
   won  the  fight  7-6  with  a  grand and glorious effort.

   The Dark Ages were characterised by great  ignorance  and
   nothing very important happening.

   Renaissance that the universities adopted  the  structure
   that we see today.  Universities were gaining more struc-
   ture as an academic hierarchy developed to  parallel  the
   nobility.   Deans  and  professors  were  on  top, under-
   graduates on the bottom or to put it another way,  under-
   graduates  under  graduates.   Here  now,  a study of the
   relationship  between  a  professor,  Merlin,   and   his
   graduate student, Arthur...

   tenberg, the time of Shakespeare.  My next guest lecturer
   is discribed as 'unique' and  'an  individual'  from  the
   department of English:  Dr. Rota Lister.

222-RRROOOTTTAAA LLLIIISSSTTTEEERRR:   Yes,  of  course, tonight we improvise.  My
   old teacher  at  the  University  of  Toronto,  the  late
   Canadian  guru  Marshall  McLuhan,  breathed hot and cool
   about Guttenberg and his press, his Galaxy.  What a star-
   tossed  venture!   When  I  was a graduate student in his
   seminar at the Centre for Culture  and  Communication,  I
   knew  what  an  enviroment  was!  And an anti-enviroment!
   But now it's not nearly  so  clear  any  more.   Was  the
   medium  really  a  message, or was it just inter-galactic
   graffiti done by a Renaissance buccaneers?   Did  Gutten-
   berg  reallly  invent movable type or was he just a front
   for a Machiavellian plot to dislocate the  monarchies  of
   the  time,  to  get  all  those dumb plebeians to run for
   elected office?

   But Mac, of course, knew that the real  media  revolution
   was  an  electronic  one, that Marconi and Wiener and all
   the rest gave us all such a bums' rush that nowadays even
   a  University  campus  has  to have at least two hot/cool
   tabloids to keep us from losing  touch  with  the  Global
   Village.   So  here we are, witnesses to the MacLunacy of
   the Gazette and Imprint, as we observe the  commotion  in
   the  Imprint  office before they put the paper to bed for
   their Friday deadline.

   you  leave  university  will be the friends you made here
   and the memories of the good times you had.  Some of  you
   will  meet  your  future  spouse; some of you will decide
   university is not for you.  Whatever your decision, it is
   the  university  which  gives  you  the opertunity to ex-
   perience life on a bigger scale.  If you want to see this
   happening,  just  go to the Campus Centre one evening and
   watch the people.  Here now, the CC in the 1700's.

   to enforce morality on the  university  campus.   In  the
   1920's  Prohibition  was  declared.  As we all know, when
   something is banned there is automatically  a  source  of
   income  in suppling that thing illicitly. Organised crime
   set up speakeasies to quench the thirst  of  the  public.
   The  universities  did  not  escape the gangland violence
   that soon followed. At Waterloo the speakeay  was  in  an
   old  farmhouse  on  a  hill  and  the gang was called the
   Mathia.

   the future of universities in general and the  University
   of  Waterloo  in particular.  In order to do this, I have
   asked the Dean of Science, Don Brodie, to address you.

555-DDDEEEAAANNN BBBRRROOODDDIIIEEE:  Good evening. While science fiction has very
   little  to  do  with  science,  I  have  always  liked to
   speculate on the future.  What new  advances  will  tech-
   nology  bring  us?  Will we reach the stars?  If so, will
   we arrive in time to appologize for all those  reruns  of
   "Gilligan's Island"?  Will scientists find a cheap way to
   turn lead into gold?  Will they tell anyone?  The Univer-
   sity  will  be  affected  by  these discoveries, but many
   forces will remain the same, economics and  politics  for
   example.  What will the University of Waterloo be like in
   the years to come?  And why am I  asking  so  many  ques-
   tions?  That's _y_o_u_r job.
