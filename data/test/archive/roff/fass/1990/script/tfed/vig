111-PPPRRROOOFFFEEESSSSSSOOORRR:   Good evening, class.  This course is FASSical
   Studies, or as some of my students last year  called  it:
   Hunks o' History.

   You all have the course outline in front of you (HOLDS UP
   PROGRAM). If you turn to page 3 you will see that 40%  of
   the  course  will  be  studied before the midterm and 30%
   afterwards. There is no final, and bribing the  professor
   is encouraged.

   Call  me  old  fashioned  but I ask that you do not bring
   food or drinks to lectures as I  find  them  distracting.
   The  same  can  be  said for cigarettes. Cameras and tape
   recorders are also forbidden, as the course is  available
   from  Correspondence already and I don't want to cut down
   on my royalty income.

   This course is an examination of the creation and  evolu-
   tion of the University of Waterloo and its parallels with
   the  evolution  of  western  civilization,  if  the  term
   civilization  can  be  given  to  a society that includes
   engineering.

   I will be making extensive use of  audio-visual  aids  in
   teaching  this  course.  I may also take advantage of the
   wide variety of experts on faculty by bringing  in  guest
   lecturers.

   As time is short, let's get started right away, shall we?

(AT THIS POINT THE Professor CAN EITHER INTRODUCE SCENE OR A
GUEST LECTURER)

   What is it that separates man from the rest of the animal
   kingdom?   There  are many answers to that question. Some
   say it is man's interest in the arts.  I  believe  it  is
   man's  intellect. Intelligence is one of the paradoxes of
   our evolution. Knowledge threw us out of  the  Garden  of
   Eden,  yet  knowledge is what lets us enter a university.
   In this first lecture  I  will  show  how  man  developed
   language  and,  as a result, became the grand creature he
   was destined to be!

111-PPPRRROOOFFFEEESSSSSSOOORRR:    Thus  the  first  of  the  universities  was
   founded. In their early years universities  were  violent
   and  self-serving places. "Every man for himself" was the
   prevalent attitude. People thought  nothing  of  stabbing
   colleagues  in the back and taking credit for their work.
   Come to think of it, not much has changed.   And  it  all
   seems  rather  silly,  doesn't  it, when you realize that
   university politics are so vicious because the stakes are
   so  small. Now, the fighting was not restricted to within
   the campus. Universities fought each other on  the  field
   of  battle.   Again  not much has changed except that the
   war is now fought on the  football  field.   One  of  the
   Great  Wars  was fought between Troy and Athens, or as we
   know them today, Waterloo and Wilfrid  Laurier.   Let  us
   take a look at the causes of this epic struggle.

   the ages with Laurier usually coming out  on  top.   This
   year,  however, was different as our Warriors of Waterloo
   won the fight 7-6  with  a  grand  and  glorious  effort.
   WARRRRR-I-IORS!!!

   The  Dark  Ages were characterised by great ignorance and
   nothing very important happening.

4-PROFESSOR:  We now enter middle age, (PUTS ON GLASSES) I'm
   sorry, that should be the Middle Ages.   In  these  times
   the  university  was becoming more structured. At the top
   of the hierarchy was the President. He was paid homage by
   the  Deans  who  in turn were serviced by the -- Im sorry
   that should be served--  by  the  professors  and  lesser
   academia.  At the bottom of the scale were the students.

111-PPPRRROOOFFFEEESSSSSSOOORRR:   One  of  the great achievements of man is the
   ability to communicate ideas in many ways:  art,  poetry,
   and  language.   The  Renaissance  was a rebirth of these
   forms of expression, which  is  why,  I  suppose,  it  is
   called the Renaissance.

                          - fin -
A vital  focus  of  student  life  came  to  be  the  campus
newspaper,  giving  students  a  voice  through which to ex-
press their concerns.  This  tradition  reached  its  zenith
during  the  Renaissance when the beauty of language bloomed
in its fullest flower. There existed one campus blessed with
two  such  journals, the Imprint and the Gazette, two papers
both alike in infamy. We observe here the doings of the  Im-
print  office  on  a  hectic  Thurs- day before their Friday
deadline.

   place for learning, the university is a place  to  relax,
   to  be  entertained  and  to  mature into fine upstanding
   human beings. Because of this, at  least  one  university
   set up a faculty of Human Kinetics and Leisure Studies to
   examine students at rest and students in  motion,  or  to
   put  it  more  succinctly, students in bed. In the 1800's
   they had the moves and didn't need the rest, as we  shall
   soon see.

111-PPPRRROOOFFFEEESSSSSSOOORRR:   We  now jump to an era when society attempted
   to enforce morality on the  university  campus.   In  the
   1920's  Prohibition  was  declared.  As we all know, when
   something is banned there is automatically  a  source  of
   income  in suppling that thing illicitly. Organised crime
   set up speakeasies to quench the thirst  of  the  public.
   The  universities  did  not  escape the gangland violence
   that soon followed. At Waterloo the speakeaywas in an old
   farmhouse on a hill and the gang was called the Mathia.

4-PROFESSOR:  For this last lecture I would like to look  at
   the  future of universities in general and the University
   of Waterloo in particular. We've  all  seen  the  trends:
   funding  cutbacks,  a  more  conservative  student  body,
   rising stereo prices. How will the universities of  today
   prepare  for  tomorrow? Here for you now is a speculative
   look at a possible future.
