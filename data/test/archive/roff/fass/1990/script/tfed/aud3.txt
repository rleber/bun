   friend in the Campus Centre.  This  is  the  Great  Hall,
   isn't it?

222-AAANNNIIITTTAAA MMMAAANNNNNN:   Actually, it's not that great. You must be a
   frosh.

3-GUY:  Is it that obvious?

4-ANITA:  Don't worry about it, I'm in first year myself.

5-GUY:  Pleased to meet you...

   but  the  corset  burning  went  on longer than expected.
   Speaking of which, why are you dressed like that?   Women
   have  spent  months  protesting for the right to dress as
   they wish, and here you are, jumping into the pitfalls of
   societal norms!

7-ANITA:  But this is how I WANT to dress.

8-ANNE:   Anita, this isn't about how you want to dress. The
   feminist movement EXPECTS you to dress a certain way, and
   if  you  go and buckle under to societal pressure, you're
   letting us all down....(SUDDENLY  NOTICES  Guy).  By  the
   way, who's the sperm bank?

9-ANITA:  Oh, sorry. Anne, this is... ummmm...

10-GUY:  My name is Guy.

11-ANNE:   "Guy?"  Well,  I  guess that says something about
   your parents' creativity.

13-GUY:  Oh, yeah? What are the people in France doing these
   days?

14-CLAUDE:  They're revolting.

111555-LLLEEEWWWIIISSS SSSCCCRRREEEWWW:  Well, there's no need to get personal.

16-GUY:  Anyway, Claude, this is Anita, and her friend Anne.
   (TO Anita) I was wondering if you two want to go dancing,
   or something. It's baroque-and-roll night  at  the  Bomb-
   shelter.

17-ANITA:   Well,  actually,  we  were  going to watch Opera
   Gratis.

18-GUY:  Oh. I see. Well, maybe some other time.

19-ANITA:  You could watch it with us.

20-GUY:  That's an idea. Let's grab someplace to sit.

(OPERA BEGINS)

21-ANNE:  God, look at those stooges up there thinking  they
   can do Opera.

22-CLAUDE:   Actually this is really a Sing-Spiel.  You see,
   if it didn't have any talking in it then it would  be  an
   Opera or perhaps an Operetta but because...

23-ANNE:   Shut  up.   I'd rather listen to Larry, Curly and
   Mozart.  (INDICATES ACTORS IN OPERA)

24-GUY:  (TO SELF) Gee, look at them up there.   They're  so
   talented  and  sure of themselves.  I bet women really go
   for that sort of thing.  Maybe I can lower my  voice  and
   comb my hair to look like Don Giovanni.

25-ANITA:   (TO  Guy)  Look  at  those  self-righteous, smug
   idiots.  They honestly think women fall for that sort  of
   thing.

26-GUY:   (COUGHS  NERVOUSLY.  PAUSE, THEN TO HIMSELF) Gosh,
   she's beautiful. I could look at her for hours.

27-ANITA:  (TO HERSELF) He's staring at me. Oh,  God,  there
   must be something on my face.

(Anita  ATTEMPTS  TO  DISCREETLY RUB HER HAND OVER HER FACE,
LOOKING FOR FOREIGN MATTER)

28-GUY:  (TO HIMSELF) I think it's time to put my arm around
   her. Let's be subtle...

Guy PUTS HIS ARM AROUND Anita, WHO, ODDLY, DOESN'T OBJECT)

29-ANITA:   (TO HERSELF) He did it. He's not a jerk. I think
   he likes me. As long as he's sincere and just tries to be
   himself, this evening will go beautifully.

30-GUY:   (TO HIMSELF) Phase one accomplished. Now what do I
   do?

(OPERA ENDS)

31-CLAUDE:  (ROMANTICALLY, TO Anne)  You know, I can't  help
   but  notice  that  it's  been  some  time  since you last
   spouted some misguided feminist rhetoric.  Would  you  be
   interested in going out sometime?

32-ANNE:   Oh,  please.   Spare me.  They say love is blind,
   but deaf, dumb, and unable to smell?

33-CLAUDE:  Oh, well.  Perhaps some other time?

34-ANNE:  Look, the only reason I'd ever get close to you is
   to  reach  down  your  throat and pull out your heart, so
   that I could toss it into a corner and dance on  it  with
   hob-nailed  boots.  Then  I'd stick the whole thing in an
   oven and cook the stuffing out of  it,  cut  it  up  into
   little pieces, serve it to you on toast and expect you to
   say "Gee, thanks. It's delicious." Got it?

35-CLAUDE:  All right. It's a date! (LEAVES ECSTATICALLY)

(Anne JOINS Guy, Lewis AND Anita)

36-GUY:  I was kind of wondering... (HE TAKES A STEP  CLOSER
   TO  Anita,  AND  Lewis DOES LIKEWISE, REMAINING TOO CLOSE
   FOR INTIMATE CONVERSATION.   Guy  TURNS  TO  FACE  Lewis)
   Hey,  Lewis, why don't you go get popcorn for next week's
   show.  The line-up is probably pretty short right now.

37-LEWIS:  Hey, that's a great idea! (HE EXITS)

38-GUY:  (TO Anita) I was kind of wondering if... if I could
   have your phone number.

39-ANITA:   I'm  still  on the waiting list. It won't be in-
   stalled until 1903.

40-GUY:  Oh. Look, I really want to  see  you  again.   Just
   being around you, I get this funny feeling ...

41-ANNE:  Saltpeter can take care of that.

42-ANITA:   Well,  maybe  we'll  bump  into each other again
   sometime.

43-ANNE:   Well,  I'm sure it was nice meeting you, Guy, but
   Anita and I have to get going  now,  or  we'll  miss  the
   Safety Carriage.

44-GUY:   (HE ONLY HAS EARS FOR Anita) Maybe we could go out
   and get a coffee or something.

45-ANNE:  Don't you remember, Anita? You  have  that  really
   BIG assignment to do...

46-ANITA:   Why don't you go on ahead? I think Guy will walk
   me home.

47-ANNE:  All right, but remember  what  I  said.  A  farmer
   isn't going to buy a cow if he can get the milk for free.
   (SHE EXITS)

48-GUY:  So, do you, ... that is... do you have a boyfriend?

49-ANITA:  I did, but he was a  jerk...  I  mean,  I've  got
   nothing against jerks. You're not a jerk, are you?

50-GUY:  I gave it up for lent.

(VERY CASUALLY, THEY BEGIN TO GET CLOSER, LOCK ARMS, ETC)

51-ANITA:  Sorry you and Anne didn't hit it off.

52-GUY:   What  is  her  problem? Did her parents lose a bet
   with God?

53-ANITA:  No, she just thinks that  men  are  imperialistic
   oppressors who only think with one of their heads.

54-GUY:   I'm  surprised  that she doesn't see more castrati
   opera.

(Guy AND Anita SIT ON THE BACK OF A COUCH  WHICH  IS  FACING
AWAY FROM THE AUDIENCE)

55-ANITA:   (STARRY-EYED  AND  SEXUALLY  CHARGED) I hope you
   found this opera...  stimulating.

56-GUY:  I did. Especially the... climax...

57-ANITA:  Shut up and kiss me.

(Guy AND Anita ENGAGE IN A PASSIONATE EMBRACE. Lewis  ENTERS
WITH  POPCORN.   Guy  and  Anita  FALL  OVER THE BACK OF THE
COUCH, LEAVING ONLY THEIR LEGS VISIBLE. Lewis MOVES  UPSTAGE
OF  THE  COUCH, WATCHING THE EVENTS ON THE COUCH UNFOLD, AND
QUIETLY EATS HIS POPCORN)
