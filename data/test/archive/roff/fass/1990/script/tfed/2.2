(THIS SET IS REMARKABLY LIKE THE  FRONT  ROOM  OF  THE  GRAD
CLUB, WITH THE BAR, ENTRANCE WAY, AND TABLES. ONE CORNER HAS
HOWEVER BEEN SET UP TO ACCOMODATE A SMALL BAND. AS THE SCENE
OPENS, TWO BARTENDERS ARE VISIBLE.  THEY ARE Tom Collins , A
NOVICE  BARTENDER  WHO  IS  A  COMBINATION  OF  TOM   CRUISE
(COCKTAIL)  AND  THE  AIRHEAD ROOKIE PITCHER IN BULL DURHAM,
AND Scott Sean D'Roques, WHO FULFILLS THE  TWO  COUNTERPOINT
ROLES  FROM  COCKTAIL  AND BULL DURHAM.  Scott KNOWS ALL THE
TRICKS, AND IS ATTEMPTING TO TEACH Tom  HOW  TO  BE  A  GOOD
BARTENDER.)

   the glass.

7-SCOTT(4):  Right, kid. I sense you've got talent, and with
   a bit of work, I know you can make it rich.

8-T.C.(4):  I don't know. I just  can't  make  any  of  your
   tricks work.

9-SCOTT(5):   Here's  an  even  more basic trick. With this,
   even you can clean up... It's called a mop. (HANDS MOP TO
   Tom.)

10-T.C.(5):  What are the secret codes for tonight?

11-SCOTT(6):  The password to get in is --

(Scott  LOOKS THROUGH PEEPHOLE IN DOOR, AND UNLOCKS THE DOOR
SO THE BAND CAN ENTER. THIS IS THE 5  MAN  ECLECTICAL  BAND,
WHICH  COMPRISES WHATEVER MIXTURE OF RHYTHM, PIANO, STRINGS,
WOODWINDS, AND BRASS WE CAN OBTAIN)

(THE 5-MAN ECLECTICAL BAND IS A BAD BAND, WHICH CAN'T  QUITE
GET  ITS  ACT  TOGETHER.  THEY ARE, HOWEVER, GOOD AT PLAYING
THEIR INSTRUMENTS, ALTHOUGH NOT TOGETHER.  THE BAND  MEMBERS
ARE  Harvey  Naghila  -- BAND LEADER, THE MOST NORMAL OF THE
BAND, BUT A BIT OF A LOW-STATUS LOSER;  Harpo  C.  Chord  --
SOMEWHAT AUTISTIC AND ONLY TALKS IN SONG FRAGMENTS; Tim Pan-
ni -- RHYTHM, A FAST-TALKING SALESMAN TYPE; Ritardo  Montal-
ban  --  SARCASTIC  AND  RATHER  DEPRECATING OF THE WORLD IN
GENERAL; AND Paul E. Phonic -- A COOL-SCHOOL TYPE WHO  TALKS
IN  SCAT-STYLE RHYTHMS.  THERE IS NO EFFECTIVE LEADERSHIP TO
THE BAND, AND AS THEY PLAY ANYTHING, EACH OF  THE  MUSICIANS
GRADUALLY  DRIFTS  OFF  INTO  PLAYING  THE SONG IN THE STYLE
HE/SHE LIKES BEST)

18-T.C.(6):  Remember prohibition. All we have is coffee.

19-RITARDO(2):  Okay, an American Coffee, a  Scotch  Coffee,
   and a Barley Sandwich.

20-HARVEY(2):  Water, please, if it isn't too much trouble.

222111-TTTIIIMMM PPPAAANNNNNNIII(111):  Nothing for me, no sir. Alcohol is bad for
   your health; it  rots  out  your  stomach,  destroys  the
   liver, and turns your brain to mush. Coffee contains caf-
   feine which is a stimulant and I surely don't need  that,
   and the water around here sucks. Yes sir, no sir, I don't
   know how people can live in this part of  the  world:  no
   oceans,  no mountains, no lakes, too much rain, and I can
   see why some might turn to alcohol --

22-PAUL(2):  Cool down, Mr.  Motor  Mouth.  The  dude  knows
   where it's at.

23-RITARDO(3):   You'll  have to excuse him, he used to sell
   used cars.

24-HARVEY(3):  So where are your customers?

25-SCOTT(8):  The  twelve-thirty  lectures  aren't  finished
   yet.

26-HARVEY(4):  Oh, good. I thought it was us.

27-T.C.(7):  Why would you think that?

28-HARVEY(5):  Lately our audiences have been flatter than a
   flapper's chest. At our last gig, only two people  showed
   up...my  mother  and  (POINTS  AT Ritardo) his parole of-
   ficer.

29-SCOTT(9):  Right. Why don't you play something and  we'll
   see if we can offer any suggestions.

30-HARVEY(6):  Why not?  And one, two, one-two-three...

[M-1]  (THE  BAND  STARTS  TO PLAY, BUT AFTER THE END OF THE M
FIRST LINE, THE MUSICIANS START TO WANDER FROM  THE  MELODY,
FINISHING OFF WITH "WIPEOUT")

31-HARPO(2):  Ha ha ha, Wipeout!

32-HARVEY(7):  You see, we all have our different styles.

33-T.C.(8):  Have you considered taking other kinds of work?

34-SCOTT(10):   (GLARES  AT T.C.) Guys, I think you what you
   need is something to keep you together.

35-HARPO(3):  Love, love will keep us together.

36-SCOTT(11):  I was  thinking  of  something  more  like  a
   singer.  Say  a  nice  young  lady  to sing the songs and
   provide an attractive front to the band.

37-TIM(2):  What an idea! Take a bow, sir. You have just in-
   vented the band of the  future.   Henceforth,  the  world
   will  be  a changed place, as the concept of a band being
   something that plays  music  is  replaced  by  background
   noise  with  a  voluptuous  female  clad in not very much
   strutting about the stage while  all  the  males  in  the
   audience  stare  and  drool.   What an idea. Why didn't I
   think of it?

38-T.C.(9):  I can think of a few reasons.

(Scott TAKES Tom TO ONE SIDE)

39-SCOTT(12):  T.C., you  need  to  work  on  your  sympathy
   lines.  People  come  to talk to a bartender for sympathy
   and free drinks. Sarcasm will only drive customers away.

40-T.C.(10):  No, really?!

41-SCOTT(13):  Now these are three lines that I like to use.
   Write  them down...  One -- You've got to take things one
   day at a time.  Two -- Women: can't live with them, can't
   live without them.  Three -- Do you walk to school, or do
   you take a lunch?  That one really gets them thinking.

42-T.C.(11):  Hey, it's twelve-thirty... What was that  pas-
   sword?

444333-FFFEEEDDDSSS(111):  (OFFSTAGE) Open up. We're the band.

48-ANNETTE(2):  Just hide your instruments and put  on  your
   disguises.  If they can't recognize us, they won't ask us
   to perform.

(THE FEDS HIDE THE INSTRUMENTS UNDER THE TABLE  AND  PUT  ON
GROUCHO MARX GLASSES)

49-NESS(2):   I'll  wager  this is the hideout of the hollow
   men, and their secretive leader, Macavity.

50-ANNETTE(3):  Now there's a real mystery cat.

51-NESS(3):  Now that we're  in,  what's  our  strategy  for
   getting the Mathia?

52-ANNETTE(4):  I know how.

53-PADDY(2):   (IGNORING  Annette) I wrote down a plan to do
   that while we were travelling here on the back of an  en-
   velope.

54-LESTER(2):  Gosh, Mr. Wax.  I thought we drove here.

55-PADDY(3):  Yes. Unfortunately, I lost the envelope.

56-ANNETTE(5):  I have a plan.

57-LESTER(3):   (IGNORING  Annette) So, what are we going to
   do?

58-ANNETTE(6):  Look, we've got to prove that the Mathia are
   associated with this club, and we need proof of spirits.

59-NESS(4):  Yes of course, Annette. I guess the first thing
   we have to prove is that the Mathia owns this joint.

60-PADDY(4):   And  then  we  have  to  prove  that  illegal
   beverages  are  being  sold  in  this place which rot the
   brain.

61-ANNETTE(7):  And if we can establish those things, we can
   confiscate this club as part of their ill-gotten gains.

62-NESS(5):   Who  would want such a place, stuck out in the
   middle of this wasteland?

63-PADDY(5):  What this place needs is a waitress  to  serve
   us a beer with a beautiful body.

64-LESTER(4):  Like Toby or Guinness?

69-PADDY(7):  Columbian, of course.

   the coffee.

   We won't make a peep as
   We congregate surreptitiously
   Flappers, mobsters, all that jazz
   (If they) catch us, we're gonna be bound for Alcatraz
   They say it's stupid to do but we dare
   We're drinking distilled spirits
   So keep it very quiet or the campus'll hear its
   Whole population'll want a sensational
   Grad Club Rendezvous (How deplorable)
   Grad Club Rendezvous (Woo-hoo)
   Grad Club Rendezvous (Give us a sip)

(MAYBE DURING THE SONG THERE CAN BE DANCING BY MATHIA AND/OR
FEDS)

105-DOT(6):  So, what do you think?

106-LESTER(6):  Gee,... it was different.

107-T.C.(18):  I've never heard that arranged quite that way
   before.

108-AL GEBRA(4):   And  it  was  ... interesting the way the
   various instruments used different rhythmic devices...

109-AL GORITHM(5):   ...  to  counterpoint  the   underlying
   melody.

111111111-AAALLLLLL(111):  Well, yes.  (GENERAL RHUBARBS OF AGREEMENT)

112-PHYLL(5):  How much are we paying that band?

113-AL GORITHM(6):  Too much.

114-PHYLL(6):   Once, just once, I'd like to see a real band
   in here.

115-DOT(7):  Why not put Cal  in  charge  of  entertainment.
   He's got a real bent for that sort of thing.

116-NESS(7):   What  are  they  trying to do, drive away the
   customers?

117-ANNETTE(9):  No, drive them to drink.

118-PHYLL(7):  Scott, how are the coffee sales doing?

119-SCOTT(16):   It  looks  like  we're going to make 30,000
   dollars before taxes.

120-AL GORITHM(7):  And we don't pay no taxes.

121-AL GEBRA(5):  This is your best  operation  ever,  boss.
   It even beats the prime numbers racket.

122-LESTER(7):   Did you hear that?  They virtually admitted
   they owned the club.

123-CAL(6):  And we own it all.

124-LESTER(8):  They did, they did admit it.

125-PHYLL(8):  My friends, it's been a good year.   To  sum-
   marize,  our  operations  are multiplying, and we are ex-
   tending our domain across the entire range of the campus.

126-DOT(8):  I knew it was worth the commute from Guelph  to
   associate with this set.

127-PHYLL(9):   In  honour of this occasion, I have prepared
   gifts for you all.

(BARTENDERS HAND OUT GIFTS OF BASEBALL BATS)

128-AL GORITHM(8):  A natural log!

129-PHYLL(10):   A  gift   that   represents   my   personal
   philosophy:  Speak easy and carry a big stick.

130-PADDY(8):  We've heard enough.

131-NESS(8):   Then  let us fight them, me and you, 'til the
   Mathia are spread out black  and  blue,  like  a  patient
   etherized upon a table.

132-ANNETTE(10):  He means let's get 'em.

133-LESTER(9):  Right.

(FEDS  ALL  TAKE  OFF  THEIR  GLASSES.   Lester PRODUCES HIS
BADGE)

   Everybody freeze.

111333444-MMMAAATTTHHHIIIAAA(111):  Burr.

135-PADDY(9):  We're the Feds, and you're all  under  arrest
   for  racketeering,  illegal  sales of liquor, and wearing
   ugly pink ties.

136-PHYLL(11):  The Feds!

137-ANNETTE(11):   Lady,  you're  about to have your budgets
   cut.

138-PHYLL(12):  First, we'll do some  cutting  of  our  own.
   (SNAPS FINGERS)

(Al,  Al  &  Phyll  DRAW  KNIVES MADE OF BUNDLES OF COMPUTER
PAPER TRACTOR FEED AND ADVANCE ON FEDS.   Cal  &  Dot  COWER

139-LESTER(10):   You don't scare me -- your knives are made
   out of paper.

140-AL GORITHM(9):  Yes, but they're made out of hundreds of
   pieces of nasty sharp paper.

141-AL GEBRA(6):    That's   right,  gumshoes.   Each  knife
   guaranteed to give you dozens of paper cuts.

142-PHYLL(13):  And when we're done with the  cutting,  then
   we'll take some lemon juice from the bar...

143-NESS(9):   Enough  of  your  threats.  Open  your violin
   cases, gentlemen.

144-ANNETTE(12):  Hey!

145-NESS(10):  And persons.

(THE FEDS OPEN THEIR VIOLIN CASES AND TAKE OUT PISTOLS)

146-PADDY(10):  Just like the Mathia to bring  knives  to  a
   gun fight.

147-PHYLL(14):   Boys,  I  think this problem demands a more
   rigorous solution.

(MATHIA OPEN VIOLIN CASES AND PULL OUT TOMMY GUNS)

148-T.C.(19):  Look out, Scott!  They've got guns!

149-SCOTT(17):  That's not a gun.  (PULLS OUT BAZOOKA)  This
   is a gun.

150-T.C.(20):  Now we told you you can't fight in here.

151-SCOTT(18):   So put away those pea shooters, while I try
   to straighten out this mess.  As I understand  this  con-
   flict,  (POINTS BAZOOKA AT FEDS) you want to shut us down
   and throw us out of work, (POINTS BAZOOKA AT MATHIA)  and
   you  want  us  to  keep operating, and earning exorbitant
   amounts of money.  Right?

(Scott WAVES BAZOOKA UP AND DOWN AND COMBATANTS NOD IN TIME)

152-LESTER(11):  Yes --

153-ANNETTE(13):   (QUICKLY  SHUTTING  Lester  UP)  How much
   money is exorbitant amounts?

(Scott WHISPERS AN ANSWER TO Annette)

   Eliot, we need to talk.

(THEY TALK)

154-NESS(11):  After sober reflection, I think that we could
   find a way to modify our position.

155-PADDY(11):  How about if we gave them a job at Scoops?

(BARTENDERS  REACT  NEGATIVELY,  BY SHAKING THE BAZOOKA BACK
AND FORTH)

156-LESTER(12):  Federation President?

(BARTENDERS REACT NEGATIVELY AGAIN)

157-PHYLL(15):  Give up Feds. They wouldn't changes sides if
   you offered them jobs as keystone campus cops.

158-NESS(12):  (TO BARTENDERS) Keystone campus cops?

(BARTENDERS REACT VERY NEGATIVELY. OTHER FEDS LOOK AT Eliot)

   It was worth a try.

159-ANNETTE(14):   How  about this: the club stays open, but
   under new management,  and  with  a  20  per-cent  raise,
   profit sharing plan, and a stock option for the staff.

160-SCOTT(19):  With Dental?

161-ANNETTE(15):  Of course.

(Scott  AND  Tom  LOOK  AT  EACH  OTHER,  AND THEN PIVOT THE

163-HARVEY(9):  Does that include us?

164-NESS(13):  Not unless you can dramatically  change  your
   act.

165-ANNETTE(16):  What you guys need is someone really awful
   to play with.

166-CAL(7):  Or someplace where you can't really be heard.

167-ANNETTE(17):   I've  got  it!   You  could  play  at the
   University sporting venues.  You'd be  a  good  diversion
   from the team.

168-CAL(8):  And you can't be heard for the crowd.

169-HARVEY(10):  Hmm -- we'd need a bit larger band.

170-AL GORITHM(10):  I can play da drum.

171-AL GEBRA(7):  I can, too.

172-DOT(9):  And I have a cousin who plays drums.

173-HARVEY(11):   That's  it.  A change of name, some school
   cheers, a nifty slogan, and we'll be all set.

174-SCOTT(20):  How about "The Warriors Band"?
