BLACKBOARD IS SOME SORT OF FLAT VERTICAL SURFACE, THE BORDER
OF  WHICH  RESEMBLES  A  COUPLE OF STONEHENGE SUPPORTS AND A
CROSSPIECE.  Merlin HAS SOME SORT OF WORKBENCH.  PERHAPS  IN
THE  BACKGROUND  WE  SEE  A  BACKDROP, OR FLATS, OR SOME SET
PIECES, WHICH BRING TO MIND THE STANDARD  MEDIEVAL  LACK  OF
PERSPECTIVE IN A HUMOROUS WAY)

   could fit in that sounded any good.   I'm  worried  about
   the prof, though.  I've heard he's a little flaky.

3-FEDABEER(2):  Ah, don't sweat it.  Say, the dons at Hamlet
   II have organized an orientation melee later this evening
   - why don't you help me warm up a bit?

4-NORMAN(2):  Sure.

(THE  TWO  OF  THEM  START  A  FRIENDLY  SWORD  FIGHT.  WHEN
Fedabeer DRAWS FROM HIS SCABBARD, WE SEE THAT HIS WEAPON IS,
IN  FACT,  A  RIDGID TOOL.  EACH TIME EITHER OF THEM SWINGS,
THEY FIRST ROLL A PAIR OF CAR 'FUZZY DICE' WHICH ONE OF THEM
BROUGHT,  AND  CHECK  IT, ADJUSTING THE SUCCESS OF THE SWING
ACCORDINGLY.  THIS GOES ON BRIEFLY, JUST LONG ENOUGH FOR THE
POINT  TO  SINK  IN.   Guinevere's  ENTRANCE  INTERRUPTS THE
FIGHT)

7-FEDABEER(4):  Sorry to hear that.  What's the problem?

8-GUINEVERE(2):  It's our sex life.  Every time  I  want  to
   play  doctor, he pulls out all these potions and leeches.
   I think his master's thesis is getting to him.   And  the
   worst  of  it  is,  he's  going  to  be the T.A. for this
   course!

   the Royal Engineers.  This is Lancelot.

12-GUINEVERE(4):   Oh,  yes, I almost forgot about it!  Here
   it is.  (READING)  The winning team will  be  that  which
   earns the most points by collecting objects from the fol-
   lowing list.  Let's see, the most Holy Grail,  the  sword
   Excalibur, ten dragon's teeth, a shrubbery...

16-GUINEVERE(5):   Sure,  Kay.  Now, I want you guys to keep
   this in mind:  (INDICATING THE LIST) the  Grail  and  Ex-
   calibur  are  both  worth  more  than  all the others put
   together.  So keep your eyes open.

17-KAY(2):  What can I look for, guys!?

18-LANCELOT(2):  Well, Sir Ahh!

19-KAY(3):  That's Sir Kay.

20-LANCELOT(3):  Sir Kay, Sir Ahh, Sir Ahh -- whatever.  Why
   don't  you  look  for a bag-of-holding for our stuff, and
   stay out of trouble?

21-KAY(4):  How come you guys never let me do anything?

22-LANCELOT(4):  Because you're 'special', Kay.

HE HAS JUST MATERIALIZED)

STUFF  TO  AND FROM Merlin DURING THE COURSE OF HIS LECTURE,

   name  is  Professor Merlin.  Today's introductory lecture
   for Swords and Sorcery 101 will be  an  overview  of  the
   topics we will be covering this term.

   he  would  be  so kind as to step forward and deliver the
   invocation.

   IN  LOVE')  Kyrie  eleison,  Christe eleison.  Thank you,
   you've been great.  Vos amo - and I mean that sincerely!

26-MERLIN(2):  Thank you, Brother Love.   One  of  the  most
   useful  of  the  black  arts  is divination - to see that
   which cannot be seen.  If I  could  just  have  a  little
   silence,  I will reach into the Briefcase of Omniscience,
   and provide you with an example.

(HE GESTURES APPROPRIATELY)

27-MERLIN(3):  (PULLING OUT SOME NUMBERS AND ARRANGING  THEM
   ON THE 'BOARD' AS HE SPEAKS) I sense a time when English-
   speaking peoples will suffer greatly under French domina-
   tion.    (HE  HAS  ARRANGED  '1066'  ON  THE  BOARD.   HE
   CONSIDERS IT BRIEFLY) Wait, let's not  be  too  Hastings.
   (AS HE TURNS THE 6'S UPSIDE-DOWN AND RE-ARRANGES) It is a
   time much further into the future than that.   (IT  READS
   '1990')  I see a monster -- by name, The Bear Bourassa --
   a fearsome beast with nasty, pointy teeth,  and  notwith-
   standing claws!

   anything,   he's  remembering!   Merlin  lives  backwards
   through time, so he's already seen the future.

30-MERLIN(4):  You little knave!  You think it's easy always
   knowing  what's  in  store?   Never  being  able to enjoy
   Agatha Christie!  Or a day at the race track!  I mean,  I
   already  have  a  headache  from the awful notes the min-
   strels will be playing during the  following  spontaneous
   musical number!

   It's a crime, my time is flowing backwards
   Do not envy me
   Mine's the strangest love life you will ever see.

   And, for me, there's no such thing as foreplay
   It's a dreadful curse
   I enjoy my carnal pleasures in reverse.

   Women scoff when they see that you're,
                somewhat premature in bed
   When I answer their call so deep,
                first I fall asleep instead.

   Then I wake, aglow, the morning after
   Lovestruck to the core
   Wishing to remember it forevermore
   (But) I can't recall the magic of the night before.

   study of Alchemical Engineering.  Of course, one  of  the
   greatest  achievements in this field is the transmutation
   of lead into gold.  (HE BEGINS TO PERFORM THE EXPERIMENT)

35-KAY(5):  What's that?

36-NORMAN(4):   You  just  take  your lead ingot down to the
   goldsmith's, hit him over the head with it, and take  all
   the gold you want!

37-MERLIN(7):   I would now like to introduce the fellow who
   will be assisting you with your labs, my  Talismanic  Ap-
   prentice, Art.

38-ARTHUR(2):   Thank  you, professor.  Tomorrow at dawn, as
   the course's first lab, we shall be  witness  to  a  very
   special contest, held between our own Dr. Merlin, and one
   of the University's most distinguished scholars, Dr. Mor-
   gana.

39-HERALDIC(3):   Will  this be a traditional tournament, in
   which they try to knock each other out of the saddle with
   tilting spears?

40-ARTHUR(3):   Surely you joust.  Since the outcome of this
   contest will determine the new Dean  of  the  Faculty  of
   Magic,  the  candidates will be drawing upon their finest
   skills in the Black Arts.

41-MORT(2):  Do you mean to tell  me  that  the  rewards  of
   higher  office  are not given to those working in serious
   research, but to whoever can dazzle  us  with  a  lot  of
   flashy pyrotechnics?

42-ARTHUR(4):  You forget, Merlin has seen the 20th century.

43-MORT(3):  I think it stinks!

44-ARTHUR(5):  Look here, peasant!  What's your name?

45-MORT(4):  Mort D'Arthur, 'sir'.

   REST OF THE CLASS)  So, that's all.  See you at dawn.

   IN HIS HAND)  Guess I don't know my own strength.

80-MORGANA(3):   O  God  of  the Druids, send us your fiery,
   rumbling portents of rage!

[S-6] (THUNDER)                                              S

81-MERLIN(11):  Yes, well -- o wand  of  life,  bring  forth
   March  winds  and  April showers!  (HE BRANDISHES A MAGIC
   WAND AND WAVES IT, CAUSING FLOWERS TO APPEAR OUT  OF  THE
   END.  HE IS FLABBERGASTED)

82-MORT(6):   (SARCASTICALLY) Hah!  Next, we'll probably get
   pilgrims.

83-MORGANA(4):  Now  I  shall  put  the  multitudes  into  a
   profound  trance!   (SHE PULLS OUT A SCROLL , UNROLLS IT,
   AND READS) "If U sub 1 through  U sub m is a set  of  in-
   dependent  chi-square  random variables, U sub i having n
   sub i degrees of freedom, then their sum also has a  chi-
   square  density with n degrees of freedom, where n is the
   summation of n sub 1 through n sub m."

(THE STUDENTS FALL ASLEEP.  Morgana  CLAPS  HER  HANDS,  AND
THEY AWAKE)

84-MERLIN(12):   (SOTTO VOCE) Amazing!  (TO ALL) Well, now I
   shall cut one of my students in half!  Art,  fetch  me  a
   sword!

85-KAY(7):  Ooh, I hate Saxon violence!

(Arthur  SEARCHES  AIMLESSLY  UNTIL  HE  DISCOVERS  A  SWORD
THRUSTING OUT OF THE 'EGG' FOUNTAIN.   HE  YANKS  THE  SWORD
OUT, WHICH IMMEDIATELY CAUSES WATER TO FLOW OUT OF THE HOLE)

[S-7] (CHOIR OF ANGELS)                                      S

86-MERLIN(13):  (KNEELING) My liege, I am at your bidding!

87-ARTHUR(10):  What are you talking about?

88-MORGANA(5):   Do  you not know the legend of the sword in
   the stone?  It is so inscribed!  Read it, boy!

89-ARTHUR(11):  (READING) Be it known  that  whosever  pulls
   out this sword from out this stone shall be known as Dean
   -- provided that he also answer a skill-testing question.
   This offer void where prohibited by decree.  (TO Morgana)
   I am ready.

90-MORGANA(6):  What is your quest?

91-ARTHUR(12):  I am in search of true love.

(Morgana NODS, ACKNOWLEDGING THE CORRECTNESS OF HIS ANSWER)

   (APPROACHING Guinevere, AND KNEELING BEFORE HER)  And  to
   my true love I offer up this magic sword, just as I offer
   up my unyielding devotion.

(HER RESOLVE BREAKS.  SHE ACCEPTS THE SWORD,  DRAWS  HIM  UP
AND EMBRACES HIM)

92-GUINEVERE(11):  Oh, Art, my love!

93-LANCELOT(7):   Guin,  you're  not  going back to Art just
   because he sweeps you off your feet with a lot of chival-
   ry crap?

94-GUINEVERE(12):   No,  Lance,  (LOOKING  BACK  TO Art) I'm
   Art's by choice.

95-NORMAN(7):   Wow,  that's  one  mighty  powerful   sword!
   What's the caliber?

96-HADAGAL(8):  (READING THE SIDE OF THE SWORD)  'X'.

(Merlin COMES FORWARD)

97-MERLIN(14):  Kneel, my boy.

(Art KNEELS, AND Merlin PRODUCES A CROWN )

   Arthur,  I  hereby  crown thee, the Once and Future Dean.
   (HE SO CROWNS HIM) In honour of such occasions, it is our
   practice  to  recognize  men  of distinction by so naming
   campus buildings.  In the  grand  tradition  of  Matthews
   Hall  and  the  Davis  Centre,  we shall henceforth have:
   Art's Library!

98-ARTHUR(13):   (RISING)  This is all a little much for me.
   I mean, I know nothing about running a faculty.

99-MORGANA(7):  You'll be fine.  Let me give  you  a  little
   bit of history...

************************************************************
*****                     Waterloo                     *****
*****                  to the tune of                  *****
*****                      Camelot                     *****
************************************************************


   'Twas long ago when ignorance was lord
   The throne of higher learning was restored.

   The king was forced to sign the Magna Carta
   His barons were insistent, it is true
   They felt a university should start u-p in Waterloo.

   From ev'rywhere came men of mighty powers
   The finest teachers England ever knew
   And so ensconced themselves in iv'ry towers in Waterloo.

   Waterloo, Waterloo!
   To you we proudly pledge our troth
   Here's to Waterloo,   (ALL)  Waterloo!
   Each Moor and Visigoth.

   (SUBTLY INDICATING Merlin)
   In time your teaching gets a little sloppy
   Perhaps you haven't published for a year
   Don't worry when you're through
   Cause you've got tenure, too
   Incompetence won't matter while you're here at Waterloo.

   MORT:

   Waterloo, what a zoo!
   The students here get screwed a lot
   Here in Waterloo, what to do?
   It is a feudal plot.

   (ALL, SLOWLY AND MAJESTICALLY)
   So if you wish to be a full professor
   To o-ur sage advice you'll lend an ear
   Discover something new
   But make sure when you do
   It brings in lots of dollars while you're here at Waterloo!
