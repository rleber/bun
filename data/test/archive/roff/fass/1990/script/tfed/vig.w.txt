111-PPPRRROOOFFFEEESSSSSSOOORRR:   Good evening, class.  This course is FASSical
   Studies, or as some of my students last year  called  it:
   Hunks o' History.

   You all have the course outline in front of you (HOLDS UP
   PROGRAM). If you turn to page 3 you will see that 40%  of
   the  course  will  be  studied before the midterm and 30%
   afterwards. There is no final, and bribing the  professor
   is encouraged.

   Call  me  old  fashioned  but I ask that you do not bring
   food or drinks to lectures as I  find  them  distracting.
   The  same  can  be  said for cigarettes. Cameras and tape
   recorders are also forbidden, as the course is  available
   from  Correspondence already and I don't want to cut down
   on my royalty income.

   This course is an examination of the creation and  evolu-
   tion of the University of Waterloo and its parallels with
   the  evolution  of  western  civilization,  if  the  term
   civilization  can  be  given  to  a society that includes
   engineering.

   I will be making extensive use of  audio-visual  aids  in
   teaching  this  course.  I may also take advantage of the
   wide variety of experts on faculty by bringing  in  guest
   lecturers.

   As time is short, let's get started right away, shall we?

   would  like  to introduce a legend from that Faculty, the
   mother of all engineers, June Lowe.

222-JJJUUUNNNEEE LLLOOOWWWEEE:  If we are going to study  the  development  of
   the  university we must start by examining where all good
   universities began: engineering.  What  was  man  without
   tools?  Just  a  huddled,  starving mass of humanity.  It
   took engineers to develop the tools and weapons necessary
   to catch food, to develop the wheel in order to transport
   his possesions.  But what was  man's,  or  should  I  say
   engineering's, first discovery?  Let's find out shall we?

111-PPPRRROOOFFFEEESSSSSSOOORRR:    Thus  the  first  of  the  universities  was
   founded. In their early years universities  were  violent
   and  self-serving places. "Every man for himself" was the
   prevalent attitude. People thought  nothing  of  stabbing
   colleagues  in the back and taking credit for their work.
   Come to think of it, not much has changed.   And  it  all
   seems  rather  silly,  doesn't  it, when you realize that
   university politics are so vicious because the stakes are
   so  small. Now, the fighting was not restricted to within
   the campus. Universities fought each other on  the  field
   of  battle.   Again  not much has changed except that the
   war is now fought on the  football  field.   One  of  the
   Great  Wars  was fought between Troy and Athens, or as we
   know them today, Waterloo and Wilfrid  Laurier.   Let  us
   take a look at the causes of this epic struggle.

   science type books, once said, "any sufficiently advanced
   science is indistinguishable from magic." I guess this is
   why I was asked to give the lecture on Merlin,  King  Ar-
   thur  and  the  Round Table.  I approached this task with
   trepidation until I realized that the corollary  of  that
   statement  is  also  true.   In  those  days, science was
   simply sufficiently advanced magic.  While much had  been
   lost  in the Dark Ages (misplaced in the dark, I suppose)
   it was all being rediscovered.  It must have been an  ex-
   citing  time.  Universities were gaining more stucture as
   an academic hierarchy developed to parallel the nobility:
   deans  and professors on top, under-graduates on the bot-
   tom or to  put  it  another  way,  under-graduates  under
   graduates.

   tenberg, the time of Shakespeare.  My next guest lecturer
   is discribed as 'unique' and 'an  individual',  from  the
   department of English:  Dr. Rota Lister.

222-RRROOOTTTAAA LLLIIISSSTTTEEERRR:   Yes,  of  course, tonight we improvise.  My
   old teacher  at  the  University  of  Toronto,  the  late
   Canadian  guru  Marshall  McLuhan,  breathed hot and cool
   about Guttenberg and his press, his Galaxy.  What a star-
   tossed  venture!   When  I  was a graduate student in his
   seminar at the Centre for Culture  and  Communication,  I
   knew  what  an  enviroment  was!  And an anti-enviroment!
   But now it's not nearly  so  clear  any  more.   Was  the
   medium  really  a  message, or was it just inter-galactic
   graffiti done by a Renaissance buccaneers?   Did  Gutten-
   berg  reallly  invent movable type or was he just a front
   for a Machiavellian plot to dislocate the  monarchies  of
   the  time,  to  get  all  those dumb plebeians to run for
   elected office?

   But Mac, of course, knew that the real  media  revolution
   was  an  electronic  one, that Marconi and Wiener and all
   the rest gave us all such a bums' rush that nowadays even
   a  University  campus  has  to have at least two hot/cool
   tabloids to keep us from losing  touch  with  the  Global
   Village.   So  here we are, witnesses to the MacLunacy of
   the Gazette and Imprint, as we observe the  commotion  in
   the  Imprint  office before they put the paper to bed for
   their Friday deadline.

   place for learning, the university is a place  to  relax,
   to  be  entertained  and  to  mature into fine upstanding
   human beings. Because of this, at  least  one  university
   set up a faculty of Human Kinetics and Leisure Studies to
   examine students at rest and students in  motion,  or  to
   put  it  more  succinctly, students in bed. In the 1700's
   they had the moves and didn't need the rest, as we  shall
   soon see.

   to enforce morality on the  university  campus.   In  the
   1920's  Prohibition  was  declared.  As we all know, when
   something is banned there is automatically  a  source  of
   income  in suppling that thing illicitly. Organised crime
   set up speakeasies to quench the thirst  of  the  public.
   The  universities  did  not  escape the gangland violence
   that soon followed. At Waterloo the speakeay  was  in  an
   old  farmhouse  on  a  hill  and  the gang was called the
   Mathia.

   because I am from Architecture  and  it  takes  place  in
   front of the Davis Centre.  Such is the logic behind this
   course.  The reason I agreed to still do  this  introduc-
   tion  si that the scene deals with another topic close to
   my heart.  Given the course the University  is  on,  what
   will  it  be  like in 20 years?  20 years ago this campus
   was a hotbed of student radicalism.  Now it's fairly con-
   servative.   What's next?  Here is a peculative look at a
   possible future.
