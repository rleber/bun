111-PPPRRROOOFFFEEESSSSSSOOORRR:   Good evening, class.  This course is FASSical
   Studies, or as some of my students last year  called  it:
   Hunks o' History.

   You all have the course outline in front of you (HOLDS UP
   PROGRAM). If you turn to page 3 you will see that 40%  of
   the  course  will  be  studied before the midterm and 30%
   afterwards. There is no final, and bribing the  professor
   is encouraged.

   Call  me  old  fashioned  but I ask that you do not bring
   food or drinks to lectures as I  find  them  distracting.
   The  same  can  be  said for cigarettes. Cameras and tape
   recorders are also forbidden, as the course is  available
   from  Correspondence already and I don't want to cut down
   on my royalty income.

   This course is an examination of the creation and  evolu-
   tion of the University of Waterloo and its parallels with
   the  evolution  of  western  civilization,  if  the  term
   civilization  can  be  given  to  a society that includes
   engineering.

   I will be making extensive use of  audio-visual  aids  in
   teaching  this  course.  I may also take advantage of the
   wide variety of experts on faculty by bringing  in  guest
   lecturers.

   As time is short, let's get started right away, shall we?

   What is it that separates man from the rest of the animal
   kingdom?  There are many answers to that  question.  Some
   say  it  is  man's  interest in the arts. I believe it is
   man's intellect. Intelligence is one of the paradoxes  of
   our  evolution.  Knowledge  threw us out of the Garden of
   Eden, yet knowledge is what lets us enter  a  university.
   In  this  first  lecture  I  will  show how man developed
   language and, as a result, became the grand  creature  he
   was destined to be!

   Qualter  of  the  Political Science Dpartment.  Professor
   Qualter was one of the original  lecturers  for  FASS  in
   1963.  Sir?

222-TTTEEERRRRRRYYY QQQUUUAAALLLTTTEEERRR:   Thank  you.   Having discovered language,
   man's next invention was a fairly obvious one:  politics.
   As  soon  as  men  started  talking  to  one  another the
   fighting broke out.  In their  early  years  universities
   were  violent  and  self-serving  places.  "Every man for
   himself" was  the  prevalent  attitude.   People  thought
   nothing  of  stabbing  colleagues  in the back and taking
   credit for their work.  It's nothing like  that  now,  of
   course.   One  of  the Great Wars was fought between Troy
   and Athens.  Actually, it wasn't, but the script  demands
   historical  distortion  to introduce the next scene.  The
   war between Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier.

   Dr.  Phil Eastman from the Physics Department.  Dr. East-
   man is a longtime supporter of FASSical  Studies  and  we
   are honoured by his presence tonight.

555-PPPHHHIIILLL EEEAAASSSTTTMMMAAANNN:   Arthur  C.  Clarke,  an  author of several
   science type books, once said, "any sufficiently advanced
   science is indistinguishable from magic." I guess this is
   why I was asked to give the lecture on Merlin,  King  Ar-
   thur  and  the  Round Table.  I approached this task with
   trepidation until I realized that the corollary  of  that
   statement  is  also  true.   In  those  days, science was
   simply sufficiently advanced magic.  While much had  been
   lost  in the Dark Ages (misplaced in the dark, I suppose)
   it was all being rediscovered.  It must have been an  ex-
   citing  time.  Universities were gaining more stucture as
   an academic hierarchy developed to parallel the nobility:
   deans  and professors on top, under-graduates on the bot-
   tom or to  put  it  another  way,  under-graduates  under
   graduates.   Here,  now,  a typical day in the Faculty of
   Science, sorry, Magic.

   tenberg, the time of Shakespeare.  My next guest lecturer
   who is discribed as 'unique' and 'an individual'  in  the
   department of English:  Dr. Rota Lister.

222-RRROOOTTTAAA LLLIIISSSTTTEEERRR:   Yes,  of  course, tonight we improvise.  My
   old teacher  at  the  University  of  Toronto,  the  late
   Canadian  guru  Marshall  McLuhan,  breathed hot and cool
   about Guttenberg and his press, his Galaxy.  What a star-
   tossed  venture!   When  I  was a graduate student in his
   seminar at the Centre for Culture  and  Communication,  I
   knew  what  an  enviroment  was!  And an anti-enviroment!
   But now it's not nearly  so  clear  any  more.   Was  the
   medium  really  a  message, or was it just inter-galactic
   graffiti done by a Renaissance buccaneers?   Did  Gutten-
   berg  reallly  invent movable type or was he just a front
   for a Machiavellian plot to dislocate the  monarchies  of
   the  time,  to  get  all  those dumb plebeians to run for
   elected office?

   But Mac, of course, knew that the real  media  revolution
   was  an  electronic  one, that Marconi and Wiener and all
   the rest gave us all such a bums' rush that nowadays even
   a  University  campus  has  to have at least two hot/cool
   tabloids to keep us from losing  touch  with  the  Global
   Village.   So  here we are, witnesses to the MacLunacy of
   the Gazette and Imprint, as we observe the  commotion  in
   the  Imprint  office before they put the paper to bed for
   their Friday deadline.

   from the Faculty of Science.  When I was approached about
   taking part in FASS this year, I asked if the scene I was
   introducing  had anything to do with my field: chemistry.
   I was told, and I quote, "well, yes, it's bio-chemistry".
   I  guess  it depends on your definition of bio-chemisrty.
   This scene deals with student life,  you  know,  the  boy
   meets girl type of biochemistry.  As my student days hap-
   pened over... ten... years ago I don't feel I  have  much
   to  add  to  the  discussion.   So,  here now, the Campus
   Centre as it was in the late 1700's.

   and  other  things  tonight,  but  we  have  ignored  the
   paramount   discipline   of   the   University.     Mine.
   Economics.    Without   which   human  existance  is  not
   possible.  Without which you are  merely  debris  on  the
   ocean  of  life.   So, we need a lesson in economics.  In
   the 1920's Prohibition was declared.   As  we  all  know,
   when  something is banned there is automatically a source
   of income in suppling that thing  illicitly.   The  basic
   law  of  supply  and  demand.   Organised  crime  set  up
   speakeasies to quench the  thirst  of  the  public.   The
   universities  did  not  escape the gangland violence that
   soon followed.  At Waterloo the  speakeaywas  in  an  old
   farmhouse on a hill and the gang was called the Mathia.

   the  future of universities in general and the University

   funding  cutbacks,  a  more  conservative  student  body,
   rising stereo prices. How will the universities of  today
   prepare  for  tomorrow? Here for you now is a speculative
   look at a possible future.
