   CHORUS:

   Paris was a simple shepherd
   Watching o'er his flock by night, he
   Heard a call from Gods on high:
   Athena, Hera, Aphrodite.

   A task was given unto Paris,
   A golden apple was the prize.
   To choose which Goddess was the fairest
   (And) which one had the finest... thighs?

(Paris IS ONSTAGE WITH HIS SHEEP, Wool Rogers AND Fleece Ir-

7-PARIS(2):  I heard it through the Chorus Line.

8-HERA(3):   Look,  we've got this little disagreement. This
   golden apple is supposed to go to  the  fairest  goddess.
   These  two upstarts dispute my obvious claim. My husband,
   Zeus, refused to get involved, so we had to find a mortal
   -- and you're it.

(HANDS Paris THE APPLE)

9-PARIS(3):  Eenie, Meenie, Minie...

10-HERA(4):   Before  you  decide,  consider that I am Hera,
   goddess of petty  intrigue  and  bureaucratic  authority.
   Choose  me,  and  you'll  never have another eight-thirty
   class.  No waiting at the  bookstore.  You  could  get  a

   broker! The woman he chooses needs to have  great  brains
   and a nice tush!

15-HERA(5):  Too bad yours are in the same spot!

(Athena IGNORES THIS AND TURNS TO Paris)

16-ATHENA(4):   I  am Athena, goddess of skill and strategy.
   Choose me, and I promise you success on  the  only  field
   that  counts: the field of battle.  I could make you into
   the Tough Knight that your team needs to win.

17-PARIS(4):  Sounds great. After all... (CATCHES  SIGHT  OF

   But,  pray  tell, you aren't planning to take your sheep,
   are you?

28-PARIS(8):  Shouldn't I?

29-LORENZO(4):  Why, think of the undesirable jealousy  that
   you would arouse by arriving with such winsome livestock.
   The last time Darius took his skunk Binky to the theatre,
   people  all  over  were  screaming and yelling with envy.
   (Lorenzo HAS A QUICK, SILENT CONFERENCE WITH  Darius  AND
   Darius) Darius here suggests that you find someone versed
   in critter husbandry to look after them.

   I do not wish to zap or zop.
   I only want this war to stop.
   My name is Zeus, but call me Doc.
   I have the floor, so let me talk.

   Could all you Greeks, and all you Troys
   Please try to be good girls and boys.
   Learn to share each other's toys.
   And don't make such an awful noise!

64-PARIS(16):  But Doctor Zeus, it was them...

65-MENEPAUS(7):  Nonsense! You started it.

66-HELEN(6):   You  grubby-handed,  snake-eyed, dirt-belied,
   maggot-sucking, deformed excuse  for  a  sewer  rat!  You
   treat me like an object and then expect me to like it? At
   least from sheep-boy here, I get love  and  respect.  Ac-
   tually,  he's  kind  of  cute,  once  you get used to the
   smell.

67-DR. ZEUS(2):

   You little kids are much too gruff.
   Now listen here: I've had enough!

   Helen hides at Waterloo,
   Fleeing Athen's sexist zoo
   You'll fight until you're black and blue
   Let her decide what SHE should do!

68-MENEPAUS(8):  But Dr. Zeus...

69-DR. ZEUS(3):

   Hold your tongue 'til I am done
   A million volts is NOT much fun!
   (THREATENS Menepaus WITH BOLT)

   I've thunk deep thoughts, and plumbed my mind,
   Dredged through this muck, and so I find:
   My wicked willful wanton wifey,
   With Athene and Aphrodite,
   Caused this whole Kabob-kerflapple,
   Just to claim some stupid apple!

(ENTER THE THREE GODDESSES, SHAMEFACEDLY)


   Say "Sorry" now, to them and me,
   Before my bolts go snicker-snee.

(THE GODDESSES MUMBLE APOLOGIES)


   Go to your rooms!

(GODDESSES EXIT, WHINING)


   Greeks, your motives full of greed
   Ire me most: get lost, with speed.

(GREEKS LEAVE, GRUMBLING)


   Helen, you lovely blushing flower,
   Take care of Paris... and make him shower!
   You Trojan boys who bothered me,
   Will not escape from this scot free
   This curse will balance your good luck:
   Your campus will be plagued with ducks!
