   students are out to make it rich with a degree from these
   nouveau Ivy League halls of champagne riches  and  caviar
   dreams  at  the  University  of  Waterloo.   Today, we're
   coming to you live from outside the  oldest  building  on
   campus,   the  William  G.  Davis  Centre  for  Computing
   Research.  Behind me, you can see the disintegrator beams
   flashing as the old Math and Computer Science building is
   being leveled to make room for the  interstellar  shuttle
   garage  of  this  magnificent monument to the opulence of
   those who control and spend the  massive  tuitions  these
   students  pay.  But  all is not happy in this never-never
   land of higher learning as you'll soon see.

   this is my other clone Larry.

17-ROBIN(4):  How unusual. And just how did you manage  such

18-LARRYS(5):   Well,  I  was  a test subject for a graduate
   biohumanoid engineering  project.  They  were  trying  to
   triple my virility, and things got out of hand.

   diseases,   deadly   computer  viruses  which  have  been
   spreading across the globe in epidemic proportions.

   you  to  practice  safe computing. Don't you realize that
   when you interface with a computer, you  are  interfacing
   with  every computer it has ever interfaced with? We even

   computing  facilities,  it  will also remove the need for
   professors to teach their classes.  With  WAT-MEGA-SYS-1,

   Hey, take it easy. No need to push.

(BY THIS POINT, THE BRAIN PODIUM SHOULD BE ROCKING BACK  AND
FORTH, ALMOST AS IF ABOUT TO TIP OVER)

[M-3] (THIRD PHRASE, WHICH DISINTEGRATES DURING TOPPLING)    M

(THE  BRAIN  PODIUM  FINALLY  TOPPLES  OVER.  THE PRIMITIVES
THUMB THEIR NOSES AT IT, AND BEGIN THE SAME "DUM, DUM,  DUM,
ETC.",  AS  IN  SCENE I:i.  THE STAGE HAS BY THIS POINT BEEN
MYSTERIOUSLY  AND  TECHNICALLY  CLEARED   OF   SET   PIECES,
REVEALING THE FULL CAST UPSTAGE TO SING THE CLOSING SONG)

*****           Do You Hear The People Laugh?          *****

************************************************************


   Now is paradise regained, but we have paid a heavy price,
   Once again man is hurled into a world of pain and sacrifice,
   If the story you have seen caused you to shed regretful tears,
   Think for a moment on the fate of your own careers.

   If you find the kind of life you're leading here to be a gas,
   And you'd hate to leave the campus with your graduating class,
   You're bound to excel as a permanent member of FASS.

   Will you join in our crusade?  Who will be mad enough to try?
   Is there a crazy fool among you who'll be proud to do or die?
   Do you hear the people laugh?
        They could be laughing right at you,
   All of this glory could be yours if you join the crew.

   Do you promise to return?  Let us regale you with our song,
   If we do not pervert the words too much
        then you can sing along,
   When we next put on a show favour us with your presence here,
   This is a gesture you can keep as a souvenir:
   Thumbs up - until next year!

(THE ENTIRE CAST GIVES THE AUDIENCE A THUMBS-UP)
