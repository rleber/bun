   like a singer. Say a nice young lady to  sing  the  songs
   and provide an attractive front to the band.

222-TTTIIIMMM PPPAAANNNNNNIII:   What  an idea! Take a bow, sir. You have just
   invented the band of the future.  Henceforth,  the  world
   will  be  a changed place, as the concept of a band being
   something that plays  music  is  replaced  by  background
   noise  with  a  voluptuous  female  clad in not very much
   strutting about the stage while  all  the  males  in  the
   audience  stare  and  drool.  What  an idea. Why didn't I
   think of it?

333-TTTOOOMMM CCCOOOLLLLLLIIINNNSSS:  I can think of a few reasons.

4-SCOTT:  T.C., you need to work  on  your  sympathy  lines.
   People  come to talk to a bartender for sympathy and free
   drinks. Sarcasm will only drive customers away.

5-T.C.:  No, Really?!

6-SCOTT:  Now these are three lines  that  I  like  to  use.
   Write  them  down...  One - You've got to take things one
   day at a time.  Two - Women: can't live with them,  can't
   live  without them.  Three - Do you walk to school, or do
   you take a lunch?  That one really gets them thinking.
