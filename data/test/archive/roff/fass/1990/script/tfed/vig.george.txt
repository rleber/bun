   man's next invention was a fairly obvious one:  politics.
   As soon  as  men  started  talking  to  one  another  the
   fighting  broke  out.   In their early years universities
   were violent and self-serving  places.   "Every  man  for
   himself"  was  the  prevalent  attitude.   People thought
   nothing of stabbing colleagues in  the  back  and  taking
   credit for their work.  Come to think of it, not much has
   changed.  And it all seems rather silly, doesn't it, when
   you  realize  that  university  politics  are  so vicious
   simply because the stakes are so small.  One of the Great
   Wars  was  fought  between Troy and Athens, or as we know
   them today, Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier.  Let us take  a
   look at the causes of this epic struggle.
