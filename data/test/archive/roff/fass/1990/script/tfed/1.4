BEEN INVENTED YET.  AT EACH TERMINAL IS A  SCRIBE  FURIOUSLY

MUCH FRENZIED ACTIVITY ALL ROUND.  UPSTAGE, Michelangelo  IS
ON HIS BACK, PAINTING A CANVAS SUSPENDED ABOVE HIM.  PERHAPS
OFF TO ONE SIDE IS A WORKING MODEL OF  A  CLASSIC  GUTENBERG
PRINTER,  WHICH IS VERY OBVIOUSLY USED FOR ANY PURPOSE OTHER
THAN PRINTING DURING THE SCENE.  Richard COULD CRACK WALNUTS
IN  IT  OCCASIONALLY, WHICH HE BRINGS TO Bacon.  THE GAZETTE

5-OTHELLO(2):

   Sir Francis, I am at a loss to say.
   What I would do to know the secret held
   By the Gazette, whose paper is produced
   In time so short that it doth trick the eye.

6-SHAKESPEARE(2):  Perhaps some magic secret they possess.

7-OTHELLO(3):

   A magic, yes, whose name be Juliet
   The copy editor of the Gazette;
   By cunning she produced a scribe so swift
   As never has been matched by man nor beast.

(Bacon  OBVIOUSLY  COVETS  THE SUPER SCRIBE, AND Shakespeare

   Now you should talk, good William Shakespeare, "friend";
   Did we not form a partnership to write
   A weekly column, name of "Shake and Bake"?

   And tell me, whose good name appears alone?
   No "Francis Bacon", only "Shakespeare" shown.

13-JULIUS(2):

                       'Tis this;
   I fairly flew from Laurel Creek just now
   To bring to you the scoop of all our years;
   Good Chris Columbus sailed across the creek,
   Undaunted by the tales of monstrous ducks,
   To prove the university a sphere.
   (MIMING A TRIP AROUND THE GLOBE)
   Expecting he would find East Campus Hall
   Instead found wondrous colleges in which
   All manner of religions are pursued.

14-SHAKESPEARE(6):  O brave new world!

15-JULIUS(3):

          That is not all, my friends;
   Their good King James endeavours now to write
   A brand New Oxford English Bible there.
   He sent Columbus back to ask our King,
   Lord Douglas Wright, if software we'd design.

   That babes of all description shall be yours.

   Alas, the tale doth lack a happy end;
   Upon returning, Chris then parked his ships
   Beside the Campus Centre, on Ring Road.
   Though he had left them there for but a moment
   He did return to find the Nina gone,
   A victim of the towing highwaymen.
   And then, before his unbelieving eyes
   His Pinta was rear-ended and blew up.

(Julius  AND  Shakespeare  TAKE  THE  STORY  TO THE SCRIBES.
Othello HAS RETURNED TO Bacon.   Richard  ENTERS,  LABOURING
UNDER  A LOAD OF PAPER ON HIS BACK, WHICH HE DELIVERS TO THE
SCRIBES.  HE IS HUNCHED, BUT THAT IS NOT OBVIOUS YET)

20-OTHELLO(4):  Who is that knave?

(Richard  SETS  DOWN  THE  LOAD,  BUT  DOESN'T   STRAIGHTEN,
REVEALING HIS HUNCH)

21-BACON(6):  Who, he?  Richard, the turd.

22-OTHELLO(5):  The Turd?  Why give ye him that epithet?

23-BACON(7):

   'Twas he who built the stairs in Needles Hall;
   Such disregard for life and limb makes him
   The ideal henchman for my foul deeds.

   Mondays, and Wednesdays, and Fridays
   Creep in this petty pace from day to day
   To the last syllable of our garbled speech
   And all our lecture notes have lighted fools
   The way to dusty thought.  Spout, spout, we ramble!
   I'm but a walking shadow, a poor teacher
   That struts and frets his hour before the class
   And then is heard no more.  Mine is a course
   Taught by an idiot, full of sound and fury
   Signifying nothing.

54-SHAKESPEARE(17):

   (WRITING)
   '...that struts and frets...'; you have a way with words;
   May this poor writer borrow such a verse?

   But I have yet to get the interview;
   An hour's grace is all the time I need.

   I am no fool!  This wench is Juliet!
   Forget her, lad, you are forbid to see her
   She whose secret aids our enemy!

59-MICHELANGELO(2):     (HAVING    OVERHEARD    THIS    LAST
   CONVERSATION)

   My liege, this cruelty adds one more entry
   Into the bloodied ledger of your sins.
   The gods will strike you down before you're done.

60-BACON(13):  But I defy the gods, and dare them to!

   It is tragic, I agree
   But like magic, one-two-three
   All your smiles will soon turn to frowns, my friend
   All the fates portend.

   You may feel quite glorified
   But such overweening pride
   Only brings about tragedy in the end.

   You're defyin' the gods, and cryin' out "Boo! Hiss!"
   But mister -- you'll be payin' for displayin' your hubris
   Why the hell d'ya do this?

   To avoid your nemesis
   Your best strategem is this
   Let Romeo visit his gal
   Make up with Willie, he could be your pal
   On such kindness your destiny shall depend.

61-MICHELANGELO(3):   Such pride as yours has come to naught
   before!

   I am a spirit, once called Enginews.
   I too was proud and did o'erreach my grasp;
   One evening, gloating, feeling rather smug
   Was visited by Chevron's pale visage
   Ignored its warning, and so sealed my doom.

64-BACON(15):

   You had no mandate from the student body;
   Your paper was offensive to their taste.
   All campus is enthrall-ed by our prose;
   Why else would they support us with their fees?

65-TOBY(2):

   Ambition such as yours undid another;
   Recall the Thane of Cawdor, named Macbe-

66-BACON(16):

   Speak not that name!  Or else the fates are sure
   To visit us with dire consequence.
   Relax, unwind a while with Chivas Regal.

71-OTHELLO(9):   What  heavy  cares now crease your furrowed
   brow?

(Bacon COMPARES COPIES OF THE  IMPRINT  AND  GAZETTE  HE  IS
HOLDING)

72-BACON(19):

   The quality of Imprint scribes is strained;
   Their penmanship it droppeth not from heaven
   And yet Gazettes are printed small and fine
   With such a speed as leaves us in the dust.
   Thus to this quest I send thee now Othello
   So to snatch said secret super scribe;
   To aid you on your quest I have here writ
   This forgery addressed to Juliet.

73-OTHELLO(10):  I shall return ere you can say Macbet-

   For our love's sake may prove a worthy bribe
   Sir Francis says that if you let it go
   Our future is secure; Your Romeo.

   If I am to obey my lover's plea.
   But I can no more turn from his request
   As can our paper's readers stave off sleep.

   Thank the Lord we cut it here
   Else we'd have to watch, I fear
   More venom that the writers loosed
   One summer's night, while they were juiced.
