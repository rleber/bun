Paris was a simple shepherd
Watching o'er his flock by night, he
Heard a call from Gods on high:
Athena, Hera, Aphrodite.
.ve 4
A task was given unto Paris,
A golden apple was the prize.
To choose which Goddess was the fairest
(And) which one had the finest... thighs?
.ad
(Paris IS ONSTAGE WITH HIS SHEEP, Wool Rogers AND Fleece Irkus.
ENTER THE THREE GODDESSES. Hera IS HOLDING A
.prop "GOLDEN APPLE"
)
.ch her
A Shepherd ? A SHEPHERD ? THAT is supposed to judge between US ?
.ch ath
Well, he IS the only man around at the moment.
.ch aph
Maybe we can use one of the sheep instead.
.ad
(THE GODDESSES CONSIDER IT BRIEFLY)
.ch her
Not much difference. But I guess the kid will have to do.
.ch par
Hey! You're Greek Goddesses!
.ch ath
Not bad, fleece-breath. How'd you figure that out?
.ch par
I heard it through the Chorus Line.
.ch her
Look, we've got this little disagreement. This golden apple is
supposed to go to the fairest goddess. These two upstarts
dispute my obvious claim. My husband, Zeus, refused to get
involved, so we had to find a mortal -- and you're it.
.ad
(HANDS Paris THE APPLE)
.ch par
Eenie, Meenie, Minie...
.ch her
Before you decide, consider that I am Hera, goddess of
petty intrigue and bureaucratic authority.
Choose me, and you'll never have another eight-thirty class.
No waiting at the bookstore. You could get a degree
without doing any homework!
.ch woo
Big deal. I got a degree.
.ch fle
Oh yeah?
.ch woo
Yeah! My B.A.A.
.ch ath
Out of the way, you pinched-face power broker! The woman he chooses needs
to have great brains and a nice tush!
.ch her
Too bad yours are in the same spot!
.ad
(Athena IGNORES THIS AND TURNS TO Paris)
.ch ath
I am Athena, goddess of skill and strategy. Choose me, and I promise
you success on the only field that counts: the field of battle.
I could make you into the Tough Knight that your team needs to win.
.ch par
Sounds great. After all... (CATCHES SIGHT OF Aphrodite SWAYING TOWARDS HIM. HIS VOICE CONTINUES ON AUTOPILOT BUT FADES SLOWLY) 
.ch aph
Hi, Big Boy. I'm Aphrodite. I offer you ... true love.
.ad
(Aphrodite GRABS Paris, DIPS HIM LOW. LONG KISS. DAZED, Paris GIVES
Aphrodite THE APPLE)
.ch ath
You will never score again!
.ad
(Athena EXITS)
.ch her
Kiss your OSAP goodbye.
.ad
(Hera EXITS)
.ch par
So, what happens now? Do we, like, Mount Olympus?
.ch aph
(LAUGHS) You misunderstand. The woman for you is in Athens, at
the University known as Laurier. She is the most beautiful mortal in the
world: Miss Oktoberfest.

Can be found at Laurier.

In every category... eh.

Hi. Welcome to Laurier.
I'm Lorenzo, and this is my brother Darius and this is my other
brother Darius. We're here studying business in hopes of some day opening
our very own restaurant, featuring an exciting variety of food animals.
.ch par
That's nice.
.ch lor
Darius here has even picked out our little bistro's nom de plume. We're
naming it after our own personal favourite delicacy: the Roadkill Cafe. But I'm
being rude. Mr. ...
.ch par
Paris. I'm here trying to find the girl of my dreams, Miss Oktoberfest.
.ch lor
The pageant in question is just over yonder. But, pray tell, you aren't planning
to take your sheep, are you?
.ch par
Shouldn't I?
.ch lor
Why, think of the undesirable jealousy that you would arouse by arriving
with such winsome livestock. The last time Darius took his skunk Binky to the
theatre, people all over were screaming and yelling with envy.
(Lorenzo HAS A QUICK, SILENT CONFERENCE WITH Darius AND Darius)
Darius here suggests that you find someone versed in critter husbandry to
look after them.
.ch par
You fellows look like responsible... you seem to know
what you're... do you know anything about sheep?
.ch lor
Don't worry, Paris. We'll be gentle. (THEY COLLECT THE SHEEP AND EXIT)

.sb "Always" "Always"

Girl, you are to me
All that a goddess should be
And I dedicate my love to you always.
.sl hel
Boy, you are to me
That slimy trail that a slug would leave
And I know you'll smell this way for always.
.sl par
But I still know
That our love could grow
And forever it will be us and the sheep.
.sl hel
Your face is like the sun
I can't bear to look at it
When you come around, I get hives all day.

Marry me, my sweet!
We'll have a nice hut, eleven babies
And a flock to call our own for always.

But he'll help me get away from these Greeks
So I'll play along with him -- for now, anyways.

Brilliant deduction, darling. But why leave a duck? I mean, if they're
