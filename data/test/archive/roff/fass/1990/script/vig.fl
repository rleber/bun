Good evening, class. 
This course is FASSical Studies, or as some of my students last year
called it: Hunks o' History.
.ex
You all have the course outline in front of you (HOLDS UP
PROGRAM). If you turn to page 3 you will see that 40% of
the course will be studied before the midterm and 30%
afterwards. There is no final, and bribing the professor
is encouraged.
.ex
Call me old fashioned but I ask that you do not bring
food or drinks to lectures as I find them distracting.
The same can be said for cigarettes. Cameras and tape
recorders are also forbidden, as the course is available
from Correspondence already and I don't want to cut down
on my royalty income.
.ex
This course is an examination of the creation and evolu-
tion of the University of Waterloo and its parallels with
the evolution of western civilization, if the term
civilization can be given to a society that includes
engineering.
.ex
I will be making extensive use of audio-visual aids in
teaching this course. I may also take advantage of the
wide variety of experts on faculty by bringing in guest
lecturers.
.ex
As time is short, let's get started right away, shall we?
.ex
What is it that separates man from the rest of the animal
kingdom?  There are many answers to that question. Some
say it is man's interest in the arts. I believe it is
man's intellect. Intelligence is one of the paradoxes of
our evolution. Knowledge threw us out of the Garden of
Eden, yet knowledge is what lets us enter a university.
In this first lecture I will show how man developed
language and, as a result, became the grand creature he
was destined to be!

Thus the first of the universities was
founded. In their early years universities were violent
and self-serving places. "Every man for himself" was the
prevalent attitude. People thought nothing of stabbing
colleagues in the back and taking credit for their work.
Come to think of it, not much has changed.  And it all
seems rather silly, doesn't it, when you realize that
university politics are so vicious because the stakes are
so small. Now, the fighting was not restricted to within
the campus. Universities fought each other on the field
of battle.  Again not much has changed except that the
war is now fought on the football field.  One of the
Great Wars was fought between Troy and Athens, or as we
know them today, Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier.  Let us
take a look at the causes of this epic struggle.

For the next lecture I would like to introduce Dr. Phil Eastman
from the Physics Department.
Dr. Eastman is a longtime supporter of FASSical Studies and
we are honoured by his presence tonight.

Arthur C. Clarke, an author of several science type books,
once said, "any sufficiently advanced science is indistinguishable
from magic."
I guess this is why I was asked to give the lecture on
Merlin, King Arthur and the Round Table.
I approached this task with trepidation until I realized
that the corollary of that statement is also true.
In those days, science was simply sufficiently advanced magic.
While much had been lost in the Dark Ages
(misplaced in the dark, I suppose)
it was all being rediscovered.
It must have been an exciting time.
Universities were gaining more stucture as an academic
hierarchy developed to parallel the nobility:
deans and professors on top, under-graduates on the bottom
or to put it another way,
under-graduates under graduates.
Here, now, a typical day in the Faculty of Science, sorry, Magic.

One of the great achievements of man is the
ability to communicate ideas in many ways: art, poetry,
and language.  The Renaissance was a rebirth of these
forms of expression, which is why, I suppose, it is
called the Renaissance.
.ex
A vital focus of student life came to be the campus
newspaper, giving students a voice through which to ex-
press their concerns. This tradition reached its zenith
during the Renaissance when the beauty of language
bloomed in its fullest flower. There existed one campus
blessed with two such journals, the Imprint and the
Gazette, two papers both alike in infamy. We observe
here the doings of the Imprint office on a hectic
Thursday before their Friday deadline.

All right, as we are having a double lecture

We'll be starting again in 10 minutes. Please be prompt

Good evening.
Some of you know that I am from the Faculty of Science.
When I was approached about taking part in FASS this year,
I asked if the scene I was introducing had anything to do
with my field: chemistry.  
I was told, and I quote, "well, yes, it's bio-chemistry".
I guess it depends on your definition of bio-chemisrty.
This scene deals with student life, you know, the
boy meets girl type of biochemistry.
As my student days happened over... ten... years ago
I don't feel I have much to add to the discussion.
So, here now, the Campus Centre as it was in the late 1700's.

We now jump to an era when society attempted
to enforce morality on the university campus.  In the
1920's Prohibition was declared. As we all know, when
something is banned there is automatically a source of
income in suppling that thing illicitly. Organised crime
set up speakeasies to quench the thirst of the public.
The universities did not escape the gangland violence
that soon followed. At Waterloo the speakeay was in
the Grad Club and the gang was called the
Mathia.

For this last lecture I would like to look at the future of universities
in general and the University of Waterloo in particular.  
In order to do this, I have asked
an ancient professor from the Faculty of Science to address you.
Unfortunalty, he has to be in Germany tonight,
so with a little help from Audio-Visual:  Bill Pearson.

That's better.
When I was a young prof, I couldn't afford the good stuff.
I had to drink beer, Australian stuff.
Naah, not that Fosters.
It was called Boomerang, because it always kept coming
back to you.

Good evening. While science fiction has very little to do with science,
I have always liked to speculate on the future.
What new advances will technology bring us?
Will we reach the stars?
If so, will we arrive in time to appologize
for all those reruns of "Gilligan's Island"?
Will scientists find a cheap way to turn gold into 
lead for our space age batteries?
Will they tell anyone?
The University will be affected by these discoveries, but many
forces will remain the same, economics and politics for example.
What will the University of Waterloo be like in the years to come?
And why am I asking so many questions?
That's
.ul
your
job.
