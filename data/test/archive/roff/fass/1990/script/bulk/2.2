(THIS SET IS REMARKABLY LIKE THE  FRONT  ROOM  OF  THE  GRAD
CLUB, WITH THE BAR, ENTRANCE WAY, AND TABLES. ONE CORNER HAS
HOWEVER BEEN SET UP TO ACCOMODATE A SMALL BAND. AS THE SCENE
OPENS, TWO BARTENDERS ARE VISIBLE.  THEY ARE Tom Collins , A
NOVICE  BARTENDER  WHO  IS  A  COMBINATION  OF  TOM   CRUISE
(COCKTAIL)  AND  THE  AIRHEAD ROOKIE PITCHER IN BULL DURHAM,
AND Scott Sean D'Roques, WHO FULFILLS THE  TWO  COUNTERPOINT
ROLES  FROM  COCKTAIL  AND BULL DURHAM.  Scott KNOWS ALL THE
TRICKS, AND IS ATTEMPTING TO TEACH Tom  HOW  TO  BE  A  GOOD
BARTENDER.)

5-SCOTT:  And you can pour behind your back?

6-T.C.:  Yup... (HE TRIES BUT POURS  DRINK  DOWN  HIS  PANTS
   INSTEAD OF INTO THE GLASS) But I don't always get it into
   the glass.

7-SCOTT:  Right, kid. I sense you've got talent, and with  a
   bit of work, I know you can make it rich.

8-T.C.:   I don't know. I just can't make any of your tricks
   work.

9-SCOTT:  Here's an even more basic trick. With  this,  even
   you  can  clean  up...  It's  called a mop. (HANDS MOP TO
   Tom.)

10-T.C.:  What are the secret codes for tonight?

SO  THE  BAND  CAN ENTER. THIS IS THE 5 MAN ECLECTICAL BAND,
WHICH COMPRISES WHATEVER MIXTURE OF RHYTHM, PIANO,  STRINGS,
WOODWINDS, AND BRASS WE CAN OBTAIN)

(THE  5-MAN ECLECTICAL BAND IS A BAD BAND, WHICH CAN'T QUITE
GET ITS ACT TOGETHER.  THEY ARE, HOWEVER,  GOOD  AT  PLAYING
THEIR  INSTRUMENTS, ALTHOUGH NOT TOGETHER.  THE BAND MEMBERS
ARE Harvey Naghila -- BAND LEADER, THE MOST  NORMAL  OF  THE
BAND,  BUT  A  BIT  OF A LOW-STATUS LOSER; Harpo C. Chord --
SOMEWHAT AUTISTIC AND ONLY TALKS IN SONG FRAGMENTS; Tim Pan-
ni  -- RHYTHM, A FAST-TALKING SALESMAN TYPE; Ritardo Montal-
ban -- SARCASTIC AND RATHER  DEPRECATING  OF  THE  WORLD  IN
GENERAL;  AND Paul E. Phonic -- A COOL-SCHOOL TYPE WHO TALKS
IN SCAT-STYLE RHYTHMS.  THERE IS NO EFFECTIVE LEADERSHIP  TO
THE  BAND,  AND AS THEY PLAY ANYTHING, EACH OF THE MUSICIANS
GRADUALLY DRIFTS OFF INTO PLAYING  THE  SONG  IN  THE  STYLE
HE/SHE LIKES BEST)

111777-HHHAAARRRPPPOOO CCC. CCCHHHOOORRRDDD:  One bourbon, one scotch, and one beer.

18-T.C.:  Remember prohibition. All we have is coffee.

19-RITARDO:   Okay, an American Coffee, a Scotch Coffee, and
   a Barley Sandwich.

20-HARVEY:  Water, please, if it isn't too much trouble.

   liver, and turns your brain to mush. Coffee contains caf-
   feine which is a stimulant and I surely don't need  that,
   and the water around here sucks. Yes sir, no sir, I don't
   know how people can live in this part of  the  world:  no
   oceans,  no mountains, no lakes, too much rain, and I can
   see why some might turn to alcohol --

22-PAUL:  Cool down, Mr. Motor Mouth. The dude  knows  where
   it's at.

23-RITARDO:  You'll have to excuse him, he used to sell used
   cars.

24-HARVEY:  So where are your customers?

25-SCOTT:  The twelve-thirty lectures aren't finished yet.

26-HARVEY:  Oh, good. I thought it was us.

27-T.C.:  Why would you think that?

28-HARVEY:  Lately our audiences have been  flatter  than  a
   flapper's  chest. At our last gig, only two people showed
   up...my mother and (POINTS AT  Ritardo)  his  parole  of-
   ficer.

29-SCOTT:  Right. Why don't you play something and we'll see
   if we can offer any suggestions.

30-HARVEY:  Why not?  And one, two, one-two-three...

[M-1] (THE BAND STARTS TO PLAY, BUT AFTER  THE  END  OF  THE M
FIRST  LINE,  THE MUSICIANS START TO WANDER FROM THE MELODY,
FINISHING OFF WITH "WIPEOUT")

31-HARPO:  Ha ha ha, Wipeout!

32-HARVEY:  You see, we all have our different styles.

33-T.C.:  Have you considered taking other kinds of work?

34-SCOTT:  (GLARES AT T.C.) Guys, I think you what you  need
   is something to keep you together.

35-HARPO:  Love, love will keep us together.

36-SCOTT:   I  was thinking of something more like a singer.
   Say a nice young lady to sing the songs  and  provide  an
   attractive front to the band.

37-TIM:   What  an  idea! Take a bow, sir. You have just in-
   vented the band of the  future.   Henceforth,  the  world
   will  be  a changed place, as the concept of a band being
   something that plays  music  is  replaced  by  background
   noise  with  a  voluptuous  female  clad in not very much

   strutting  about  the  stage  while  all the males in the
   audience stare and drool.  What an  idea.  Why  didn't  I
   think of it?

38-T.C.:  I can think of a few reasons.

(Scott TAKES Tom TO ONE SIDE)

39-SCOTT:   T.C.,  you  need to work on your sympathy lines.
   People come to talk to a bartender for sympathy and  free
   drinks. Sarcasm will only drive customers away.

40-T.C.:  No, really?!

41-SCOTT:   Now  these  are  three lines that I like to use.
   Write them down...  One -- You've got to take things  one
   day at a time.  Two -- Women: can't live with them, can't
   live without them.  Three -- Do you walk to school, or do
   you take a lunch?  That one really gets them thinking.

42-T.C.:  Hey, it's twelve-thirty... What was that password?

49-NESS:  I'll wager this is the hideout of the hollow  men,
   and their secretive leader, Macavity.

50-ANNETTE:  Now there's a real mystery cat.

51-NESS:  Now that we're in, what's our strategy for getting
   the Mathia?

52-ANNETTE:  I know how.

53-PADDY:  (IGNORING Annette) I wrote down a plan to do that
   while we were travelling here on the back of an envelope.

54-LESTER:  Gosh, Mr. Wax.  I thought we drove here.

55-PADDY:  Yes. Unfortunately, I lost the envelope.

56-ANNETTE:  I have a plan.

57-LESTER:  (IGNORING Annette) So, what are we going to do?

58-ANNETTE:   Look,  we've  got to prove that the Mathia are
   associated with this club, and we need proof of spirits.

59-NESS:  Yes of course, Annette. I guess the first thing we
   have to prove is that the Mathia owns this joint.

60-PADDY:   And then we have to prove that illegal beverages
   are being sold in this place which rot the brain.

61-ANNETTE:  And if we can establish those  things,  we  can
   confiscate this club as part of their ill-gotten gains.

62-NESS:   Who  would  want  such  a place, stuck out in the
   middle of this wasteland?

63-PADDY:  What this place needs is a waitress to serve us a
   beer with a beautiful body.

64-LESTER:  Like Toby or Guinness?

65-PADDY:  More like Clara Bow or Mary Pickford.

66-T.C.:   If  you'd  like  me to get anything for you, I'll
   give it my best shot.

67-NESS:  Just coffees, please. All around.

68-T.C.:  What type of coffee?

69-PADDY:  Columbian, of course.

111111111-AAALLLLLL:  Well, yes.  (GENERAL RHUBARBS OF AGREEMENT)

112-PHYLL:  How much are we paying that band?

113-AL GORITHM:  Too much.

114-PHYLL:  Once, just once, I'd like to see a real band  in
   here.

115-DOT:   Why not put Cal in charge of entertainment.  He's
   got a real bent for that sort of thing.

116-NESS:  What are  they  trying  to  do,  drive  away  the
   customers?

117-ANNETTE:  No, drive them to drink.

118-PHYLL:  Scott, how are the coffee sales doing?

119-SCOTT:  It looks like we're going to make 30,000 dollars
   before taxes.

120-AL GORITHM:  And we don't pay no taxes.

121-AL GEBRA:  This is your best operation ever,  boss.   It
   even beats the prime numbers racket.

122-LESTER:   Did  you  hear  that?  They virtually admitted
   they owned the club.

123-CAL:  And we own it all.

124-LESTER:  They did, they did admit it.

125-PHYLL:  My friends, it's been  a  good  year.   To  sum-
   marize,  our  operations  are multiplying, and we are ex-
   tending our domain across the entire range of the campus.

126-DOT:  I knew it was worth the commute from Guelph to as-
   sociate with this set.

127-PHYLL:   In  honour  of  this  occasion, I have prepared
   gifts for you all.

(BARTENDERS HAND OUT GIFTS OF BASEBALL BATS)

128-AL GORITHM:  A natural log!

129-PHYLL:  A gift that represents my  personal  philosophy:
   Speak easy and carry a big stick.

130-PADDY:  We've heard enough.

131-NESS:   Then  let  us  fight  them, me and you, 'til the
   Mathia are spread out black  and  blue,  like  a  patient
   etherized upon a table.

132-ANNETTE:  He means let's get 'em.

133-LESTER:  Right.

(FEDS  ALL  TAKE  OFF  THEIR  GLASSES.   Lester PRODUCES HIS
BADGE)

   Everybody freeze.

111333444-MMMAAATTTHHHIIIAAA:  Burr.

135-PADDY:  We're the Feds, and you're all under arrest  for
   racketeering,  illegal  sales of liquor, and wearing ugly
   pink ties.

136-PHYLL:  The Feds!

137-ANNETTE:  Lady, you're about to have your budgets cut.

138-PHYLL:  First, we'll do some cutting of our own.  (SNAPS
   FINGERS)

139-LESTER:   You don't scare me -- your knives are made out
   of paper.

140-AL GORITHM:  Yes, but they're made out  of  hundreds  of
   pieces of nasty sharp paper.

141-AL GEBRA:   That's  right, gumshoes.  Each knife guaran-
   teed to give you dozens of paper cuts.

142-PHYLL:  And when we're done with the cutting, then we'll
   take some lemon juice from the bar...

143-NESS:   Enough  of your threats. Open your violin cases,
   gentlemen.

144-ANNETTE:  Hey!

145-NESS:  And persons.

(THE FEDS OPEN THEIR VIOLIN CASES AND TAKE OUT PISTOLS)

146-PADDY:  Just like the Mathia to bring knives  to  a  gun
   fight.

147-PHYLL:   Boys,  I  think  this  problem  demands  a more
   rigorous solution.

(MATHIA OPEN VIOLIN CASES AND PULL OUT TOMMY GUNS)

148-T.C.:  Look out, Scott!  They've got guns!

149-SCOTT:  That's not a gun.  (PULLS OUT BAZOOKA)  This  is
   a gun.

150-T.C.:  Now we told you you can't fight in here.

151-SCOTT:   So  put away those pea shooters, while I try to
   straighten out this mess.  As I understand this conflict,
   (POINTS  BAZOOKA  AT  FEDS)  you want to shut us down and
   throw us out of work, (POINTS BAZOOKA AT MATHIA) and  you
   want us to keep operating, and earning exorbitant amounts
   of money.  Right?

(Scott WAVES BAZOOKA UP AND DOWN AND COMBATANTS NOD IN TIME)

152-LESTER:  Yes --

153-ANNETTE:  (QUICKLY SHUTTING Lester UP) How much money is
   exorbitant amounts?

(Scott WHISPERS AN ANSWER TO Annette)

   Eliot, we need to talk.

(THEY TALK)

154-NESS:   After  sober  reflection,  I think that we could
   find a way to modify our position.

155-PADDY:  How about if we gave them a job at Scoops?

(BARTENDERS REACT NEGATIVELY, BY SHAKING  THE  BAZOOKA  BACK
AND FORTH)

156-LESTER:  Federation President?

(BARTENDERS REACT NEGATIVELY AGAIN)

157-PHYLL:  Give up Feds. They wouldn't changes sides if you
   offered them jobs as keystone campus cops.

158-NESS:  (TO BARTENDERS) Keystone campus cops?

(BARTENDERS REACT VERY NEGATIVELY. OTHER FEDS LOOK AT Eliot)

   It was worth a try.

159-ANNETTE:  How about this: the club stays open, but under
   new  management,  and  with  a  20 per-cent raise, profit
   sharing plan, and a stock option for the staff.

160-SCOTT:  With Dental?

161-ANNETTE:  Of course.

(Scott AND Tom LOOK  AT  EACH  OTHER,  AND  THEN  PIVOT  THE

163-HARVEY:  Does that include us?

164-NESS:  Not unless you can dramatically change your act.

165-ANNETTE:   What you guys need is someone really awful to
   play with.

166-CAL:  Or someplace where you can't really be heard.

167-ANNETTE:  I've got it!  You could play at the University
   sporting  venues.   You'd  be  a  good diversion from the
   team.

168-CAL:  And you can't be heard for the crowd.

169-HARVEY:  Hmm -- we'd need a bit larger band.

170-AL GORITHM:  I can play da drum.

171-AL GEBRA:  I can, too.

172-DOT:  And I have a cousin who plays drums.

173-HARVEY:   That's  it.   A  change  of  name, some school
   cheers, a nifty slogan, and we'll be all set.

174-SCOTT:  How about "The Warriors Band"?
