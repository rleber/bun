   CHORUS:

   Paris was a simple shepherd
   Watching o'er his flock by night, he
   Heard a call from Gods on high:
   Athena, Hera, Aphrodite.

   A task was given unto Paris,
   A golden apple was the prize.
   To choose which Goddess was the fairest
   (And) which one had the finest... thighs?

(Paris IS ONSTAGE WITH HIS SHEEP, Wool Rogers AND Fleece Ir-

6-ATHENA:  Not bad, fleece-breath.  How'd  you  figure  that
   out?

7-PARIS:  I heard it through the Chorus Line.

8-HERA:  Look, we've got this little disagreement. This gol-
   den apple is supposed to go to the fairest goddess. These
   two  upstarts dispute my obvious claim. My husband, Zeus,
   refused to get involved, so we had to find  a  mortal  --
   and you're it.

(HANDS Paris THE APPLE)

9-PARIS:  Eenie, Meenie, Minie...

10-HERA:   Before  you decide, consider that I am Hera, god-
   dess  of  petty  intrigue  and  bureaucratic   authority.
   Choose  me,  and  you'll  never have another eight-thirty
   class.  No waiting at the  bookstore.  You  could  get  a

14-ATHENA:   Out  of the way, you pinched-face power broker!
   The woman he chooses needs to have  great  brains  and  a
   nice tush!

15-HERA:  Too bad yours are in the same spot!

(Athena IGNORES THIS AND TURNS TO Paris)

16-ATHENA:   I  am  Athena,  goddess  of skill and strategy.
   Choose me, and I promise you success on  the  only  field
   that  counts: the field of battle.  I could make you into
   the Tough Knight that your team needs to win.

17-PARIS:  Sounds great.  After  all...  (CATCHES  SIGHT  OF

   We're here studying business in hopes of some day opening
   our very own restaurant, featuring an exciting variety of

24-PARIS:  That's nice.

25-LORENZO:   Darius  here  has  even  picked out our little

   sonal  favourite  delicacy:  the  Roadkill  Cafe. But I'm
   being rude. Mr. ...

26-PARIS:   Paris.  I'm  here  trying to find the girl of my
   dreams, Miss Oktoberfest.

27-LORENZO:  The pageant in question is  just  over  yonder.
   But,  pray  tell, you aren't planning to take your sheep,
   are you?

28-PARIS:  Shouldn't I?

29-LORENZO:  Why, think of the undesirable jealousy that you
   would arouse by arriving with such winsome livestock. The
   last time Darius took his skunk  Binky  to  the  theatre,
   people  all  over  were  screaming and yelling with envy.
   (Lorenzo HAS A QUICK, SILENT CONFERENCE WITH  Darius  AND
   Darius) Darius here suggests that you find someone versed

67-DR. ZEUS:

   You little kids are much too gruff.
   Now listen here: I've had enough!

   Helen hides at Waterloo,
   Fleeing Athen's sexist zoo
   You'll fight until you're black and blue
   Let her decide what SHE should do!

68-MENEPAUS:  But Dr. Zeus...

69-DR. ZEUS:

   Hold your tongue 'til I am done

   Dredged through this muck, and so I find:

   With Athene and Aphrodite,
   Caused this whole Kabob-kerflapple,
   Just to claim some stupid apple!

   Before my bolts go snicker-snee.

   This curse will balance your good luck:
   Your campus will be plagued with ducks!
