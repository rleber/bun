CROSSPIECE.  Merlin HAS SOME SORT OF WORKBENCH.  PERHAPS  IN

PIECES, WHICH BRING TO MIND THE STANDARD  MEDIEVAL  LACK  OF

   fit in that sounded any  good.   I'm  worried  about  the
   prof, though.  I've heard he's a little flaky.

3-FEDABEER:  Ah, don't sweat it.  Say, the dons at Hamlet II
   have organized an orientation melee later this evening  -
   why don't you help me warm up a bit?

(THE  TWO  OF  THEM  START  A  FRIENDLY  SWORD  FIGHT.  WHEN
Fedabeer DRAWS FROM HIS SCABBARD, WE SEE THAT HIS WEAPON IS,

THEY FIRST ROLL A PAIR OF CAR 'FUZZY DICE' WHICH ONE OF THEM
BROUGHT,  AND  CHECK  IT, ADJUSTING THE SUCCESS OF THE SWING
ACCORDINGLY.  THIS GOES ON BRIEFLY, JUST LONG ENOUGH FOR THE
POINT  TO  SINK  IN.   Guinevere's  ENTRANCE  INTERRUPTS THE
FIGHT)

7-FEDABEER:  Sorry to hear that.  What's the problem?

8-GUINEVERE:  It's our sex life.  Every time I want to  play
   doctor,  he  pulls  out all these potions and leeches.  I
   think his master's thesis is getting  to  him.   And  the
   worst  of  it  is,  he's  going  to  be the T.A. for this

   the Royal Engineers.  This is Lancelot.

12-GUINEVERE:   Oh,  yes, I almost forgot about it!  Here it
   is.  (READING)  The winning team will be that which earns
   the  most points by collecting objects from the following
   list.  Let's see, the most  Holy  Grail,  the  sword  Ex-

16-GUINEVERE:  Sure, Kay.  Now, I want you guys to keep this
   in mind:  (INDICATING THE LIST) the Grail  and  Excalibur
   are both worth more than all the others put together.  So
   keep your eyes open.

17-KAY:  What can I look for, guys!?

18-LANCELOT:  Well, Sir Ahh!

19-KAY:  That's Sir Kay.

   don't  you  look  for a bag-of-holding for our stuff, and
   stay out of trouble?

22-LANCELOT:  Because you're 'special', Kay.

   we will be covering this term.

   invocation.

   LOVE') Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison.  Thank you, you've
   been great.  Vos amo - and I mean that sincerely!

26-MERLIN:  Thank you, Brother Love.  One of the most useful
   of  the black arts is divination - to see that which can-
   not be seen.  If I could just have a  little  silence,  I
   will reach into the Briefcase of Omniscience, and provide
   you with an example.

(HE GESTURES APPROPRIATELY)

27-MERLIN:  (PULLING OUT SOME NUMBERS AND ARRANGING THEM  ON
   THE  'BOARD'  AS  HE SPEAKS) I sense a time when English-
   speaking peoples will suffer greatly under French domina-
   tion.    (HE  HAS  ARRANGED  '1066'  ON  THE  BOARD.   HE
   CONSIDERS IT BRIEFLY) Wait, let's not  be  too  Hastings.
   (AS HE TURNS THE 6'S UPSIDE-DOWN AND RE-ARRANGES) It is a
   time much further into the future than that.   (IT  READS
   '1990')  I see a monster -- by name, The Bear Bourassa --
   a fearsome beast with nasty, pointy teeth,  and  notwith-
   standing claws!

   anything,   he's  remembering!   Merlin  lives  backwards
   through time, so he's already seen the future.

30-MERLIN:  You little knave!  You think  it's  easy  always
   knowing  what's  in  store?   Never  being  able to enjoy
   Agatha Christie!  Or a day at the race track!  I mean,  I
   already  have  a  headache  from the awful notes the min-
   strels will be playing during the  following  spontaneous
   musical number!

   It's a crime, my time is flowing backwards
   Do not envy me
   Mine's the strangest love life you will ever see.

   And, for me, there's no such thing as foreplay
   It's a dreadful curse
   I enjoy my carnal pleasures in reverse.

   Women scoff when they see that you're,
                somewhat premature in bed
   When I answer their call so deep,
                first I fall asleep instead.

   Then I wake, aglow, the morning after
   Lovestruck to the core
   Wishing to remember it forevermore
   (But) I can't recall the magic of the night before.

   of  Alchemical  Engineering.   Of  course,  one  of   the
   greatest  achievements in this field is the transmutation
   of lead into gold.  (HE BEGINS TO PERFORM THE EXPERIMENT)

36-NORMAN:  You just take your lead ingot down to the golds-
   mith's, hit him over the head with it, and take  all  the
   gold you want!

37-MERLIN:   I  would  now  like to introduce the fellow who
   will be assisting you with your labs, my  Talismanic  Ap-
   prentice, Art.

38-ARTHUR:   Thank you, professor.  Tomorrow at dawn, as the
   course's first lab, we shall be witness to a very special
   contest,  held between our own Dr. Merlin, and one of the
   University's most distinguished scholars, Dr. Morgana.

39-HERALDIC:  Will this  be  a  traditional  tournament,  in
   which they try to knock each other out of the saddle with
   tilting spears?

40-ARTHUR:  Surely you joust.  Since  the  outcome  of  this
   contest  will  determine  the  new Dean of the Faculty of
   Magic, the candidates will be drawing upon  their  finest
   skills in the Black Arts.

41-MORT:   Do you mean to tell me that the rewards of higher
   office  are  not  given  to  those  working  in   serious
   research,  but  to  whoever  can  dazzle us with a lot of
   flashy pyrotechnics?

42-ARTHUR:  You forget, Merlin has seen the 20th century.

43-MORT:  I think it stinks!

44-ARTHUR:  Look here, peasant!  What's your name?

45-MORT:  Mort D'Arthur, 'sir'.

   OF THE CLASS)  So, that's all.  See you at dawn.

82-MORT:   (SARCASTICALLY)  Hah!   Next,  we'll probably get
   pilgrims.

83-MORGANA:  Now I shall put the multitudes into a  profound
   trance!  (SHE PULLS OUT A SCROLL , UNROLLS IT, AND READS)
   "If U sub 1 through  U sub m is a set of independent chi-
   square  random  variables, U sub i having n sub i degrees
   of freedom, then their sum also has a chi-square  density
   with  n degrees of freedom, where n is the summation of n
   sub 1 through n sub m."

(THE STUDENTS FALL ASLEEP.  Morgana  CLAPS  HER  HANDS,  AND
THEY AWAKE)

84-MERLIN:   (SOTTO  VOCE)  Amazing!   (TO  ALL) Well, now I
   shall cut one of my students in half!  Art,  fetch  me  a
   sword!

85-KAY:  Ooh, I hate Saxon violence!

(Arthur  SEARCHES  AIMLESSLY  UNTIL  HE  DISCOVERS  A  SWORD
THRUSTING OUT OF THE 'EGG' FOUNTAIN.   HE  YANKS  THE  SWORD
OUT, WHICH IMMEDIATELY CAUSES WATER TO FLOW OUT OF THE HOLE)

88-MORGANA:   Do you not know the legend of the sword in the
   stone?  It is so inscribed!  Read it, boy!

89-ARTHUR:  (READING) Be it known that  whosever  pulls  out
   this  sword from out this stone shall be known as Dean --
   provided that he also answer  a  skill-testing  question.
   This offer void where prohibited by decree.  (TO Morgana)
   I am ready.

90-MORGANA:  What is your quest?

91-ARTHUR:  I am in search of true love.

(Morgana NODS, ACKNOWLEDGING THE CORRECTNESS OF HIS ANSWER)

   (APPROACHING Guinevere, AND KNEELING BEFORE HER)  And  to
   my true love I offer up this magic sword, just as I offer
   up my unyielding devotion.

(HER RESOLVE BREAKS.  SHE ACCEPTS THE SWORD,  DRAWS  HIM  UP
AND EMBRACES HIM)

92-GUINEVERE:  Oh, Art, my love!

93-LANCELOT:   Guin,  you're  not  going  back  to  Art just
   because he sweeps you off your feet with a lot of chival-
   ry crap?

94-GUINEVERE:  No, Lance, (LOOKING BACK TO Art) I'm Art's by
   choice.

95-NORMAN:  Wow, that's one mighty powerful  sword!   What's
   the caliber?

96-HADAGAL:  (READING THE SIDE OF THE SWORD)  'X'.

(Merlin COMES FORWARD)

97-MERLIN:  Kneel, my boy.

(Art KNEELS, AND Merlin PRODUCES A CROWN )

   Arthur,  I  hereby  crown thee, the Once and Future Dean.
   (HE SO CROWNS HIM) In honour of such occasions, it is our
   practice  to  recognize  men  of distinction by so naming
   campus buildings.  In the  grand  tradition  of  Matthews
   Hall  and  the  Davis  Centre,  we shall henceforth have:
   Art's Library!

98-ARTHUR:  (RISING) This is all a little much  for  me.   I
   mean, I know nothing about running a faculty.

99-MORGANA:   You'll  be fine.  Let me give you a little bit
   of history...

   'Twas long ago when ignorance was lord
   The throne of higher learning was restored.

   The king was forced to sign the Magna Carta
   His barons were insistent, it is true
   They felt a university should start u-p in Waterloo.

   From ev'rywhere came men of mighty powers
   The finest teachers England ever knew
   And so ensconced themselves in iv'ry towers in Waterloo.

   Waterloo, Waterloo!
   To you we proudly pledge our troth
   Here's to Waterloo,   (ALL)  Waterloo!
   Each Moor and Visigoth.

   (SUBTLY INDICATING Merlin)
   In time your teaching gets a little sloppy
   Perhaps you haven't published for a year
   Don't worry when you're through
   Cause you've got tenure, too
   Incompetence won't matter while you're here at Waterloo.

   MORT:

   Waterloo, what a zoo!
   The students here get screwed a lot
   Here in Waterloo, what to do?
   It is a feudal plot.

   (ALL, SLOWLY AND MAJESTICALLY)
   So if you wish to be a full professor
   To o-ur sage advice you'll lend an ear
   Discover something new
   But make sure when you do
   It brings in lots of dollars while you're here at Waterloo!
