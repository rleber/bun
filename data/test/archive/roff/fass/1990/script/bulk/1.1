   Do you hear the distant drum, sounding the rise of early man?
   Why don't you join us now and witness how our history began?
   Ev'ry scholar here today descended from people such as these,
   See how the winds of change began as a gentle breeze.

   We will take you on a journey through the merry days of yore,
   So prepare yourselves for revelry,
       there's lots of laughs in store,
   If we're any good you'll be rolling about on the floor.

   Join the steady march of years, follow the path of history,
   Start at the primal dawn and travel on to ages yet to be,
   With the wisdom of the past filling up our curriculums,
   There will be many things to learn when tomorrow comes.

   The survival of the fittest will allow us to progress,
   And intelligence will triumph over muscular prowess,
   If that were not true we would all be in H-K-L-S.
       (Dum-dum-dum-dum!)

   Join the steady march of years, follow the path of history,
   Ev-ery lowly undergrad and ev'ry lofty P.h.D.,
   And to think it all begins with the opposing of our thumbs,
   There will be many things to learn when tomorrow comes.
       (Dum-de-dum!)

HER THUMBS  IN  MIMICRY  OF THE  MODERNS,  WONDERING.  AFTER
MAKING THE CONNECTION, SHE CALMS THE CROWD, AND THEY SIT)

(Alice   TRIES   TO   TELL   THEM   WHAT   SHE   KNOWS,   BY
GRUNTING, WIGGLING  HER  THUMB,   POINTING,    ET    CETERA.
THEY    ARE  ENTHRALLED,   BUT   DON'T  GET  THE  POINT,  SO
SHE DOES IT IN CHARADES. THE  CROWD  WARMS   TO   THIS   AND
OFFERS   GRUNTS   IN  REPLY.   SHE   SELECTS   SOME  GRUNTS,
REJECTS OTHERS, AND WORKS HER WAY THROUGH THE CHARADE.  Neil
FIGURES  IT   OUT   GETS  THE CROWD'S  ATTENTION.  HE  PULLS

WARM  THEMSELVES,  AND  TRY  IT.   AFTER   A   BRIEF   PAUSE
FOR   REFLECTION,  THEY UNDERSTAND THE CHARADE AND GRUNT OUT
THE  ANSWER  IN  UNISON.  Alice  LEAPS UPRIGHT, AND SHOUTS)

NOISE? Alice IS SURPRISED AS THE REST OF THEM)

   Hey,  wow!   I  just  stood  up and talked!  No wonder my
   mother stressed good posture.

6-ALICE:   (SHOUTING  ABOVE  THE  DIN,  HOLDING  ALOFT   THE
   LIGHTER) Wait!  We shouldn't just keep this to ourselves!
   We should teach everyone about this.

7-OG:  Why?

8-TERRY:  To keep our friends and neighbours from  perishing
   in the cold.

9-REX:   Great, five minutes into humanity and already we're
   talking social democracy.

(MURMURS FROM THE CROWD)

10-ASTRAL:  But how could we spread this learning?

17-THAG:  Where would we build such a thing?

18-ALICE:  Over there, in the swamp.

19-OG:  The mastodon swamp?

20-ASTRAL:  You mean that  awful  place  where  unsuspecting
   creatures wander in, and become mired forever in stinking
   muck?

21-REX:  Don't you think that's appropriate?

(Alice SHOOTS Rex A LOOK OF CONTEMPT)

22-OG:  Talk, talk, talk.  All you kids do is talk.  When  I
   was your age --

   in the Ice Age!

   creating a university?

25-NEIL:  But things aren't --

26-REX:  Oh, go climb a tree, Neil.

(EVERYONE  FOLLOWS  IN  TURN,  WITH A THUMBS-UP,  EXCEPT  Og
WHO THRUSTS HIS THUMB DOWN, LAST)

29-OG:  I'm against it.  Why should we change what we  have?
   All  this  progress  is  only going to make us miserable.
   After all...

(DURING  THE  SONG,  THE UNIVERSITY IS BUILT, METAPHORICALLY
SPEAKING. SIGNS ARE HUNG ON THE TREE,  POINTING  TO  VARIOUS
BUILDINGS  OFFSTAGE,  EAST CAMPUS CAVE, ETC. PERHAPS SOME OF
THE TREES AND  ROCKS  COULD  REVERSE  TO  BECOME  WELL-KNOWN

   OG:
   What is the point of this progress?
   Who are you trying to impress?
   I'm prehistoric; my world is made of stone.
   Don't try to fix it, leave it alone.

   So drop these pretensions of knowledge,
   I'm staying here, not at college.
   I am a happy, uneducated lout,
   So count your blessings,
     And count me out!

   ALICE:
   Don't get your nose out of joint, Og.
   You seem to miss the whole point, Og.
   Our evolution is unavoidable.
   Jump on the wagon, help us to pull.

   EVERYONE:
   So teach to the whole human race, Og.
   (The) future's a wonderful place, Og.
   We're getting ready to shoot for something new,
   To build a campus, at Waterloo.

     If we think logically,
     And act accordingly,
     Then there is gonna be,
     A University!

   We've got to have education:
   Hedging against glaciation.
   And if your mind is becoming rather numb,
   Help us to plan the curriculum.

   'Cause we have to chart out our classes,
   (Which) frees us from freezing our asses.
   It's far too chilly to stand here turning blue,
     So build a campus,
       A magnificent campus,
         A remarkable campus,
           At Waterloo!

(AFTER A BIG FINISH, EVERYONE LOOKS  AROUND  AND  GIVES  THE
"FONZ THUMBS-UP OF COOL APPROVAL")

   going to do?
