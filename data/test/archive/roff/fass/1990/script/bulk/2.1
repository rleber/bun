   but the corset burning  went  on  longer  than  expected.
   Speaking  of which, why are you dressed like that?  Women
   have spent months protesting for the right  to  dress  as
   they wish, and here you are, jumping into the pitfalls of
   societal norms!

8-ANITA:  But this is how I WANT to dress.

9-ANNE:  Anita, this isn't about how you want to dress.  The
   feminist movement EXPECTS you to dress a certain way, and
   if you go and buckle under to societal  pressure,  you're
   letting  us  all  down...  (SUDDENLY NOTICES Guy)  By the
   way, who's the sperm bank?

21-CLAUDE:   The  good  news  is that for the final exam, we

27-ANITA:   Well,  actually,  we  were  going to watch Opera

   It's not easy being bent,
   Hoping the world won't notice your shape,
   And knowing that people will cross a great desert,
     walk a mile for a camel,
   But they won't walk with me.

   It isn't easy being bent,
   Seeing shoes instead of the skies,
   And wondering whether, for a moment, anybody
   Will see love in my eyes.

   But being low to the ground,
   Has its perqs, though it's strange.
   Cause with your ear to the pavement,
    and your eye to the gutter,
   You find more loose change.

   When life has dealt a savage blow,

111-OTTOMODO:  Stay back.  (HE'S STILL HOLDING Clara)

112-MORTY:  If you harm a hair on her body, I'll break every
   bone in your head...

113-D.GIOVANNI:  Stand back, Morty -- I'll handle this.  All
   right, Hunchback.  I challenge you to a duel...

114-OTTOMODO:  Very well.  I choose the weapons.  Swords.

115-D.GIOVANNI:  Bring me my foil.

(Morty  BRINGS IN TWO FOILS.  Don Giovanni AND THE Hunchback
BEGIN TO FENCE.   WITH  A  BIT  OF  COMIC  CHOREOGRAPHY,  WE
QUICKLY  ESTABLISH THAT Don Giovanni IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE
Hunchback)

116-OTTOMODO:  You're pretty good.

117-D.GIOVANNI:  Captain of the Fencing team  for  the  last
   three years.

118-OTTOMODO:   Did I say 'swords'?  What was I thinking?  I
   meant bow and arrow.  (DISCARDS HIS SWORD)

119-D.GIOVANNI:  I teach archery in my spare time.

120-OTTOMODO:  Bullwhip?

(GIOVANNI'S Girlfriends ALL GIGGLE WILDLY)

121-OTTOMODO:  No, never mind.  Quarterstaff?

122-D.GIOVANNI:  Actually, I don't think I've  ever  used  a
   quarterstaff before.

123-OTTOMODO:   Aha!  Quarterstaff it is, then.  (PICKS UP A
   STAFF)  Ho. Ha. Dodge.  Parry.   Spin.   Feint.   Thrust.

124-MORTY:  You did it!  Clara is free!  (HE UNTIES HER)

   wonderful.

126-D.GIOVANNI:  That's what all the girls say.

127-MORTY:  Well... I guess we should go now.  Thanks again.

128-D.GIOVANNI:  Just a moment.

129-CLARA:  I was hoping you'd do that.

130-D.GIOVANNI:  If I hadn't, you would have  regretted  it.
   Maybe  not today.  Maybe not tomorrow. But soon.  And for
   the rest of your life.

131-CLARA:  Oh, Don Giovanni, I love you.

132-D.GIOVANNI:  Me too.

   EVERYONE:

   We beat the Hunchback expertly
   And so, I'm sure you'll all agree
   That evil always pays a price
   And Ottomodo wasn't nice.
   Yet still you may be sure my friends
   Although it seems this story ends
   All of us have bills to pay
   So we'll return another day!

   Biceps and thighs!
   The hero always gets the chicks.
   Evil bad guys
   Always up to dirty tricks.
   And we actors
   Are off to make a sequel now
   Off to make a sequel now
   A sequel now, a sequel now, a sequel!

(TWO ACTORS DRESSED AS TECHIES COME ONTO STAGE WITH  A  LONG
SCROLL  COVERED  WITH  ACTORS'  NAMES,  AND  THEY  "ROLL THE
CREDITS".  LIGHTS UP ON "GREAT HALL" AND DOWN ON "STAGE")

133-TURNKEY:  Thank you for coming out to Opera Gratis.  The
   turnkeys  will tell you where the furniture goes.  If you
   enjoyed tonight's show, be sure to come back  next  Tues-
   day, when we present "1002: A Sea Odyssey".

(PEOPLE  BEGIN  TO CLEAR OUT, VERY QUICKLY AT THE MENTION OF
MOVING FURNITURE. NONETHELESS, SOME POOR HAPLESS  SOULS  CAN
BE  SEEN  THROUGH  TO  THE END OF THE SCENE MOVING PIECES OF
FURNITURE AROUND THE STAGE, AND PERHAPS OFF-STAGE)

134-CLAUDE:  (ROMANTICALLY, TO Anne)  You know, I can't help
   but  notice  that  it's  been  some  time  since you last
   spouted some misguided feminist rhetoric.  Would  you  be
   interested in going out sometime?

135-ANNE:   Oh,  please.  Spare me.  They say love is blind,
   but deaf, dumb, and unable to smell?

136-CLAUDE:  Oh, well.  Perhaps some other time?

137-ANNE:  Look, the only reason I'd ever get close  to  you
   is  to reach down your throat and pull out your heart, so
   that I could toss it into a corner and dance on  it  with
   hob-nailed  boots.  Then  I'd stick the whole thing in an
   oven and cook the stuffing out of  it,  cut  it  up  into
   little pieces, serve it to you on toast and expect you to
   say "Gee, thanks. It's delicious." Got it?

138-CLAUDE:  All right. It's a date! (LEAVES ECSTATICALLY)

(Anne JOINS Guy, Lewis AND Anita)

139-GUY:  I was kind of wondering... (HE TAKES A STEP CLOSER
   TO  Anita,  AND  Lewis DOES LIKEWISE, REMAINING TOO CLOSE
   FOR INTIMATE CONVERSATION.   Guy  TURNS  TO  FACE  Lewis)
   Hey,  Lewis, why don't you go get popcorn for next week's
   show.  The line-up is probably pretty short right now.

140-LEWIS:  Hey, that's a great idea! (HE EXITS)

141-GUY:  (TO Anita) I was kind  of  wondering  if...  if  I
   could have your phone number.

142-ANITA:   I'm  still on the waiting list. It won't be in-
   stalled until 1903.

143-GUY:  Oh. Look, I really want to see  you  again.   Just
   being around you, I get this funny feeling ...

144-ANNE:  Saltpeter can take care of that.

145-ANITA:   Well,  maybe  we'll  bump into each other again
   sometime.

146-ANNE:  Well, I'm sure it was nice meeting you, Guy,  but
   Anita  and  I  have  to  get going now, or we'll miss the
   Safety Carriage.

147-GUY:  (HE ONLY HAS EARS FOR Anita) Maybe we could go out
   and get a coffee or something.

148-ANNE:   Don't  you remember, Anita? You have that really
   BIG assignment to do...

149-ANITA:  Why don't you go on ahead? I think Guy will walk
   me home.

150-ANNE:   All  right,  but  remember what I said. A farmer
   isn't going to buy a cow if he can get the milk for free.
   (SHE EXITS)

151-GUY:  So, did you want to go out and get a doughnut?

152-ANITA:   Well,  actually,  doughnuts  make my brown eyes
   blue.

(LONG, UNCOMFORTABLE PAUSE)

153-GUY:  So, do you, ... that is...  do  you  have  a  boy-
   friend?

154-ANITA:   I  did,  but  he was a jerk... I mean, I've got
   nothing against jerks. You're not a jerk, are you?

155-GUY:  I gave it up for lent.

(VERY CASUALLY, THEY BEGIN TO GET CLOSER, LOCK ARMS, ETC)

156-ANITA:  Sorry you and Anne didn't hit it off.

157-GUY:  What is her problem? Did her parents  lose  a  bet
   with God?

158-ANITA:   No,  she just thinks that men are imperialistic
   oppressors who only think with one of their heads.

159-GUY:  I'm surprised that she doesn't see  more  castrati
   opera.

   found this opera...  stimulating.

161-GUY:  I did. Especially the... climax...
