           Be happy.  Brutus is an honourable man!
           He has a lean and hungry look?
           Take him to lunch!  Be happy!)

If the Imprint we've offended
Just be glad the scene has ended;
Thank the Lord we cut it here
Else we'd have to watch, I fear
More venom that the writers loosed
One summer's night, while they were juiced.
Our sole intent was to regale
Your senses with the printer's tale
So thanks a lot, we've had a ball
I'll say good night unto you all
Give me your hands, if we be friends;
(NOTICING THAT THE FOLLOWING VIGNETTE IS READY)
Oh shoot!  I see the scene change ends! (EXIT)
