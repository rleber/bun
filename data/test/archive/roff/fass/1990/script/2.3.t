(THE SCENE OPENS WITH A CROWD IN FRONT OF A BACKDROP OF THE DAVIS
CENTRE WITH A NUMBER OF FUTURISTIC BUILDINGS BEHIND IT (A LA 'JETSONS').
IN FRONT OF THIS IS A PODIUM AND A LARGE SET PIECE UNDER A COVER. A
REPORTER DRESSED LIKE ROBIN LEECH IS STANDING TO ONE SIDE.  
PEOPLE AMONG THE CROWD ARE CARRYING PLACARDS THAT ARE NOT
VISIBLE YET. NEXT TO The 3 Larrys, ALL OF WHOM THINK THEY ARE THE ORIGINAL
LARRY AND THE OTHERS ARE CLONES, IS Janet, AN ATTRACTIVE ANDROID)

This is Robin Flatworm for 'Lifestyles of the Rich and Humanoid' here in
Waterloo, where poor students are out to make it rich with a
degree from these nouveau Ivy League halls of champagne riches and caviar
dreams at the University of Waterloo.
Today, we're coming to you live from outside the oldest building on
campus, the William G. Davis Centre for Computing Research.
Behind me, you
can see the disintegrator beams flashing as the old Math and Computer Science
building is being leveled to make room for the interstellar shuttle garage
of this magnificent monument to the opulence of those who control and spend the
massive tuitions these students pay. But all is not happy in this
never-never land of higher learning as you'll soon see.
.ch p1
Stop the rape of our campus!
.ch p2
93 percent of the university population is against it!
.ch lar
What he said.
.ch rob
(WANDERS UP TO Louie) Can you tell our viewers exactly what it is
that you are protesting?
.ch p1
Every year they destroy more of our hallowed halls of learning.
.ch p2
And they're using our money to do it!
.ch lar
I lost my locker. (TO OTHER Larrys) No, my locker.
.ch p2
We can no longer afford the costs of higher learning!
.ch p1
The quality of our education is plunging!
.ch lar
Yup. I already forgot my locker combo. (INDICATES
OTHER Larrys) So did they.
.ch p1
It's a sin. We can't even spell correctly.
.ad
(PLACARDS ARE SHOWN TO THE AUDIENCE. SUGGESTIONS FOR THESE INCLUDE
'RAIZ A CHEER WEER ENGINEERZ',
'HAV A HART SAYV THE ARTS', 'DONT REK REC', 'WEEL FITE 4 MATHS TO THE VERY
LASTH'. THE Larrys MAY HOLD SIGNS SAYING 'WHAT HE SAYS', OR PERHAPS 'CORECKTLY')
.prip "PLACARDS"
.ch p2
It's not too late for the university, but I estimate that we have only
12.1 minutes left.
.ch p1
(CHANTS) We want to learn! Don't let our buildings burn!
.ad
(OTHER PROTESTERS JOIN IN THE CHANT)
.ch rob
As you can see, changes to this institution
have inspired some emotional outcry from the rambunctious
radicals among the university
population. Let's talk now with some of these anxious anarchists. (GOES UP
TO Larrys) Excuse me, can you tell our numerous and vicarious viewers who
you might be?
.ch lar
Hi. I'm Larry, this is my clone Larry, and this is my other clone Larry.
.ch rob
How unusual. And just how did you manage such a fascinating replication?
.ch lar
Well, I was a test subject for a graduate biohumanoid
engineering project. They were trying to triple my virility, and
things got out of hand.
.ch rob
And the operation - operations were a complete success?
.ch jan
Affirmative. No humanoids have ever popped my stack like these three.
.ch rob
And who might this voluptuous vision of silicon circuitry be?
.ch jan
I am known as Janet.  I spend most of
my time having my server accessed.  I have had many accounts on my
network, but Larrys may advance to the first queue position anytime.
.ch rob
Aren't you worried about overloading your system due to its
extended duty cycle?
.ch jan
Sex between two sentients is a beautiful thing. With four, it is fantastic!

Now, I know many of you are somewhat disturbed (PAUSE) at the dismantling
of our campus computer systems. The sad truth is, it was necessary. U W's
computing facilities have become infected with a number of powerful
computer viruses. This campus is infested with S.T.D's!
.ad
(CROWD GASPS)
.ch rob
So there you have it. For the first time on Holovision, a public admission
that Waterloo has a serious problem with S.T.D.'s:  System transmitted
diseases, deadly computer viruses which have been spreading across the
globe in epidemic proportions.
.ch sun
You have only yourselves to blame. We
warned you to practice safe computing. Don't you realize that when you
interface with a computer, you are interfacing with every computer it has
ever interfaced with? We even provided you with latex modems, but still you
hack away and log onto the first available terminal!

To explain to you the revolutionary aspects of this creation, I now
introduce to you Doctor Off.

Zank you, Herr Peace.
WAT-MEGA-SYS-1 is not just a collection of circuits and chips; it is the next
step in human evolution. It contains within it an actual human BRAIN!

TAKES ON THE LOOK OF AN UTTER MADMAN)

university has ever had. Since his predecessor
donated his BRAIN to science, he was a natural candidate for this experiment.
I give you Douglas Wright's BRAIN!

.ch off
Yes children. Zis is ze culmination of years of BRAIN
research. Not only will it replace all existing computing facilities,
it will also remove the need for professors to teach their classes. With
WAT-MEGA-SYS-1, knowledge can be directly transferred into the student's
BRAIN in this, the WAT-BRAIN induction booth! (POINTS TO BOOTH)

You're mad!
.ch p2
You're insane!

That is right. The university now accepts robots, androids and aliens as
students.

And you pay tuition?

The same as everyone else.

The same! Where is the profit potential in that? All right then -- my first

I, Robin Flatworm, have been chosen from amongst
the finest chroniclers of television journalism

Oh, please, I'm not worthy to --

Damn right. Marsha?
.ch ssh
Yes?
.ch doug
I'm curious. Did I do the right thing in artificially boosting your
intelligence, in giving you the knowledge of the ages on a silver platter?
.ch ssh
This knowledge could be utilised by myself and
others for the greater good of humanity, leading us to new heights of
creative endeavour. But, it also means that, like, I have to go straight
from high-school into the real world.
.xx ALL~PROTESTORS
Gasp! No! She's right! This must not be! Ooo, yuck! (VEGETABLE OR RICE)

So, like, I think that it was really sort of a yucky thing to do...
in my expert opinion.

I see now that I was wrong.  Man has come a long way down the road of
evolution.  Perhaps he should have taken the path less travelled by.
