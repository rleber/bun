Topping tonight's Eyewitness news,
fire broke out in Tonawanda tonight as a full scale nuclear strike
was accidentally ordered on the town.  Damage was estimated at
close to twenty-seven dollars and 32 cents.
Now, here's Tom, with the weather outside.

Well, that nuclear strike is causing some pretty heavy weather today.
Winds are expected to reach up to 700 miles an hour.
The temperature is currently 7000 degrees
(that's 3,871 degrees centigrade for you Canadian viewers) with barometric
pressure rising to 400 inches of mercury.  The National Weather Service
