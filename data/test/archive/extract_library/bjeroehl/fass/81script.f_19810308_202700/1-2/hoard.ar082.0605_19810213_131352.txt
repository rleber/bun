Is there anyone here who's NOT a spy?
.ad
(EVERYBODY LOOKS AROUND -- NO RESPONSE)
.ex
Then let's cut the cutesie-poo dialogue and start speaking English.
.ch yd
Maudit Anglais!
.ch kp
I don't see what's wrong with spy-talk.
Back in the old days, we always spoke in code.
But this younger generation has no respect for tradition.
.ch ca
Yeah, I guess those must have been the days -- when
spying was a respectable profession.

(ENTER I.M.BORING)
.ch im
Good afternoon, Ladies and Gentlemen.
I am Mr.I.M.Boring and I represent your employer.
.ch yd
Our employer?  Who are we working for?
.ch im
Let's just say you're working for five hundred dollars a day plus expenses.
Is that satisfactory?
(PAUSE) Good.  Of the two thousand spies who applied for this job,
only 100 have been chosen.
You have all gone through a thorough selection process
designed to find the best spies in the world.
Not to mention the cheapest.
.ch dm
What selection process?
.ch rr
Don't you remember sending in 5 Fruit Loops box tops
and two arts degrees?
.ch dm
I thought I was applying for grad school.
.ch im
It is necessary for you to fill out these forms for Income Tax purposes.
.ad
(HE HANDS OUT FORMS)
.ex
They're really quite simple, but please listen carefully to my instructions
-- I do not intend to repeat myself.
.ch ca
What'd you say?
.ch im
I said, I don't intend to repeat myself!
(PAUSE)
Now, in space 1 enter your total income for the year 1980.
Then deduct all amounts invested in an RRSP, RHOSP or RSVP.
Put the result in Box 2.
Take the result out of Box 2.
Multiply this value by the taxation factor found in table 27B.
Deduct from this amount the windspeed velocity of a laden tree swallow.
Take the square root of this number and enter it in box 27.
Plot it as a function of your contributions to WATFUND in the next five years
(on average, with standard deviation not to exceed 50%).
Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x.
This is multiplied by the Superfluous Multiplier Factor found in table 31C.
Exchange with your neighbour and sign on the dotted line.
Any questions?

(ALL THE SPIES HOLD UP HANDS.)
.ex
Good.  Now there are some Life Insurance people who would like to talk to you.
.ad
(ENTER MANUEL AND PAULA.)
.ex
This is Manuel Life and this is Paula C.Holder.  Carry on, you two.
.ch ml
Hi there, friends.
Have you ever considered what would happen to your loved ones if,
heaven forbid, you were transferred to that great multi-national in the sky?
.ch ph
Think of your children begging for OSAP grants in the streets... your
mother forced to do auto repairs to survive...
.ch ml
Why not provide for your loved ones in advance by buying a policy
from the Expendable Life Assurance Company?
.ch ph
Yes, at Expendable Life we offer complete coverage.
You get both life and injury insurance for a mere $50,000
a year, payable annually or in convenient hourly installments.
.ch ml
You'll sleep easily in the knowledge that your family's fully cared for.
.ch kp
Just what coverage would I get?
.xx MANUEL~AND~PAULA
.sb AMPUTATION TOUCHA-TOUCHA
If you're pinkie's cut off...don't scoff
You'll get a dollar forty-nine...
(You mean me?  Uh-huh.)

Thank you. Now if you'll excuse us for a moment we will continue with
some other business.

(MANUEL AND PAULA EXIT.

.ch xr
Ladies and Gentlemen.
.ad
(THE SPIES CONTINUE TO TALK.)
.ex
Ladies and Gentlemen!  I have been chosen to give you your briefing.
You have a very dangerous mission ahead of you.
.ch yd
Are we going to smuggle guns into Afghanistan?
.ch xr
No, something really dangerous...
.ch ms
(HORRIFIED)  You mean we're going to steal the ridgid tool?
.ch xr
I said dangerous, not suicidal.
You're going to steal military secrets from a foreign embassy.
.ad
(OOHS AND AHHS FROM THE SPIES)
.ex
Now to help on your mission, we're going to show you some of the
things that you're likely to find in a standard foreign embassy.
.ad
(TWO GRIPS BRING IN A DESK.)
.ex
This is a standard embassy desk.
You will find desks like this in embassies all over the world.
Note the working telephone and the embassy name, in this case
"EMBASSY A".
.ad
(THE GRIPS CARRY ON THE SAFE)
.ex
These of course are the standard FASS safes. You will see them in nearly
every scene in this show. Note the security alarm panel beside the safe door.
.ch ca
What alarm panel?
.ad
(AN ARM REACHES OUT AND SLAPS THE PANEL ON THE DOOR.)
.ch xr
This panel.
.ad
(THE GRIPS CARRY ON A SLEEPING GUARD.)
.ex
And this is the standard embassy guard.
Note the look of keen intellect, the aura of awareness,
the savage ferocity lurking just under the surface.
.ad
(THE GUARD SNORES LOUDLY.
THE REST OF THE EQUIPMENT IS BROUGHT ON AS XRAY CONTINUES TALKING.)
.ex
Now we want you all to sneak into various embassies around the world.
.ch dm
How do we get in?
.ch xr
Through the standard embassy secret door located here behind the guard.
.ad
(SHE OPENS UP THE TRAP)
.ch dm
Looks like a trap to me.
.ch xr
You will go to the safes and you will steal the most top secret
war plans you can find.  You will bring them back here where we
will put those plans to our own fiendish uses.
Any questions?  Good.  Then I'll pass you back to our friends
from Expendable Life.
.ad
(POLLY AND MANUEL RE-ENTER.  THEY SEE XRAY AND HER MACHINE GUN.)
.ch ml
That woman has a gun!
.ch ph
Stay away from those precious life insured bodies with that gun!
.ch xr
I think they've seen guns before.  
They are spies, after all...
.xx MANUEL~AND~PAULA
SPIES!?!?!?
.ch ml
But Mr.Boring told us they were accountants...
.ad
(THE SPIES LAUGH)
.ch ph
We've been had!!!
.ch xr
Well, that's all folks.
Happy accounting.
.ad
(DR.TUBE LAUGHS AND EXITS.)
.ch ml
(IN DISBELIEF)
Mr.Boring lied to us.
.ch ph
We just insured 100 spies. And they bruise easier than Macintoshes.
When Head Office finds out, we'll be sent to
the north pole!
.ch ml
Well, Eskimos need life insurance too.
.ch ph
Don't be such a drip!  We're ruined!
.ch ml
It doesn't seem fair...
.ch ph
We've got to come up with some way to keep those spies alive.
.ch ml
But how?
.ch ph
I've got an idea.  Yes, it just might work...
.ch ml
What is it?  What is it?
.ad
(PAULA WHISPERS IN MANUEL'S EAR.  HE REACTS WITH SHOCK.)
.ex
That's awful!
.ch ph
Do we have any choice?
.ch ml
Well, all's fair in love and insurance.
.ch ph
Insurance makes strange bedfellows.
