 you realize the gravity of this situation.
It is absolutely imperative that I get in touch with Fassablanca!
.ch ss
(IMPRESSED:)
What is it?
.ch iu
It's a bunch of people who make toys and sell them for profit,
but that's not important now.
This requires personal action.
I'm going to Fassablanca myself
to try and stop the army before it's too late.

A likely story!  Tell that red commie that the feeble lies of

The capitalist lackey says that the claims of the servant of the
Workers Paradise conflict with his bourgeois superstitions.

Aye, and tell the reactionary foot-kisser thug that the workers of the world
will not allow this blatant falsehood to go unchallenged.

Tell that pinko that these proud sons of the bastion of liberty

It is!  It is an impenetrable force field.

You have nothing that can get through that field and hurt us.

Actually, since we can see through the force field, light can get through.
And since we can hear through the force field, sound can get through.
Therefore the brightness and shock waves of something like a bomb
would be able to get through the field and kill us all.
A tactical nuclear device would work quite nicely.
