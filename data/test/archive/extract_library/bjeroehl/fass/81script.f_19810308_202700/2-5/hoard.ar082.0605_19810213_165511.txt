Besides, I must have got one or two commies when the bomb fell.
Look, I tell you what we do.  We blame the bombing on the
enemy and order a full scale nuclear strike.  On whom?
Why pick favourites?  We bomb everybody.
That way we can blame THEM for our little slip-up.
(EXCITED)  Yes sir.  Thank you sir.
I'll call out the bombers right away.
(HE HANGS UP.)

Uhh, General, correct me if I'm wrong, but did you just bomb Buffalo?

.ch gd
Why are there no phones in this place?
.ch cg
(POINTING TO COOL'S CROTCH)  I know where there's a pay phone.
.ch gd
If you think starting World War III is worth a whole twenty cents...
.ch fs
Sir, if you don't mind my asking, what was wrong with the
phone back in the other room?
.ch gd
The Fassablanca people were in the other room.
.ch fs
So?
.ch gd
I'm not going to let enemies of our country overhear our
top secret missile firing codes.
.ch ga
Why does it matter?  They're soon going to be blasted

.ch gd
It's the principle of the thing, Gator.  Do you think I want a

World destruction is a very personal thing.
.ch ga
Sorry, sir.  I hadn't thought of it that way.
.ch cg
(COOL'S CROTCH AGAIN) There's a phone here, General.
.ch gd
About time. (HE GETS THE PHONE.)
Hello, this is a top priority alert.  I want to fire every missile
we've got at every target there is.  What?  (SIGHING)
Yes, I'll hold.
.ch iu
General, you don't mean to tell me that you can just phone
up and call a full scale attack.  You haven't identified yourself,
you haven't given any code words...
.ch gd
Code words!  I knew there had to be a trick to this.
Major Exxon, pass me the code book.
.ch ex
Sergeant Sunoco, pass me the code book.

Private Parts, pass me the code book.

.ch ex

.ch gd
Shut up, Major.  Now why don't we have the code book?
.ch pp
Well, I didn't think I had to take the code book everywhere.
Boy, no one tells me anything...
.ch gd
(BACK ON THE PHONE)  Oh, hello.  You want the codes for calling
a missile strike?  So do I, to tell the truth.  Look, why don't
you get everything ready to go and I'll call you back as soon as I can?
Right.  Bye-bye.
.ch mo
How are we going to get the code book, General?
.ch gd
We'll just have to go back to the base and pick it up.
.ch cg
Wait a second, sir.  Fassablanca stole all our plans, didn't they?
.ch gd
We know that, Grovel, that's what started this whole thing off.
.ch cg
Well then, somewhere around here they must have a copy of our code book.
.ch fs
They likely have everything locked in those two safes!
.ch gd
Brilliant idea!  We'll just open the safes and we'll be all set.
.ch mo
How are we going to open the safes, General?
.ch gd
Damn it, Screw, why are you always asking such tough questions?
.ch ss
Hey, mon general, we could bomb the safes to smithereens.
.ch gd
Sunoco, the last time we tried to bomb this company, we hit Buffalo.
.ch ba
Hey, if we try it again, maybe we'll hit Oshawa!
.ch ss
I don't mean we use missiles, your generality.
We just get a few sticks of nitro and plant them right against the safes.
.ch iu
Sticks of nitro?
Nitro doesn't come in sticks.
.ch ss
Okay, quarts of nitro.
.ch gd
That's better.  Now let's head out to the jeep for some quarts of nitro.

What are you doing here?
.ch sy
What do you think I'm doing here?  When you went charging out
of the GO Station, I followed you.  I figured you might be
stupid enough to run right in on the raid, so I stole an army
uniform and hung around to try to keep you out of trouble.
.ch iu
Keep

out of trouble!  Why you over-blown wind-bag, I could have
escaped at any time.  You're just lucky I didn't kill you before
I found out who you were.
.ch sy

I'm
lucky?  I could have killed you seventeen different ways
just using my left earlobe if I'd felt like it.
And I tell you, I'm feeling like it right now.

You'll have to work fast.  There'll be a bunch of soldiers

Five minutes!  Hey, I could bite those safes open in three minutes.

Fassablanca fired you?

You don't work for Fassablanca any more?

It's a shame, isn't it?

Dreadful pity.  Of course, you realize that you can't possibly

by the Fassablanca people.
.ch dm
Why not?
.ch ml
Well, our group rates are quite reasonable, but when it comes to insuring
individuals our prices are a little less competitive.
.ch ms
How much less?
.ch ph
Three million bucks a month.

Plus tax.

is about to start World War III.
.ch sa
Ask me if I care.

But what's the point in stealing the plans if the world gets destroyed?
.ch kc
The world won't be destroyed.  Not all of it, anyway.
No one will bomb the North Pole.

You might be safe up there, but when the world gets
blown up, who'll buy your new war game?

I don't know... maybe the Eskimos... or the Tiger Cats.

That's ridiculous.

Look, it doesn't matter if there aren't many people around.
I'll have the best war game on earth and that's all that counts.

So I'll change a few of the code words and juggle a few things.
