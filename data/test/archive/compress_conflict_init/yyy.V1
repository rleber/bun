  \  killing.  Don't get me wrong, any detective will tell you\n   death isn't picky:
  it'll take you  in  the  fog,  in  the\n   snow,  in broad daylight if it wants
  to.  But some nights\n   are special -- when the rain is falling  like  a  widow's\n
  \  tears  and  the lightning cuts the sky like a rusty razor\n   blade and the thunder
  rumbles  like  the  approach  of  a\n   motorcycle  gang  --  those  are  the nights
  murder likes\n   best.  Death dogs the steps  of  storm-tossed  travellers\n   taking
  shelter wherever there's a roof overhead, and then\n   it moves among them...the
  uninvited guest, sharing  in  a\n   cup  of coffee, sitting with you by the fireplace,
  biding\n   its time.  Sooner or later, its chance will come;  you'll\n   trust  that
  friendly-looking face, you'll turn your back,\n   you'll let yourself drop off to
  a sleep that you'll never\n   wake  from.   Unless  you  know  better.   Unless
  \ you've\n   learned to be hunter instead of victim.  My name is  Spam\n   Sade
  \ and  victims  who  need  a hunter hire me to follow\n   death's footprints through
  mud and rain  on  nights  like\n   these...when  lives  are  on  the line and the
  weather is\n   murder.\n\n[S-2] (THUNDER)                                              S\n\n[L-1]
