  \  first scene?\n\n4-GRANDDAD:  Well, Tommy, that's a good question.  To answer\n
  \  it, I think I'll tell you a little story.\n\n5-TOMMY:  I hate your stories, Granddad.\n\n6-GRANDDAD:
  \  A  long time ago, when I was about your age, I\n   lived in a two-room log  cabin
  \ heated  by  a  woodstove.\n   Twice  a  day,  I'd  have to go out and chop wood
  for the\n   fire, and whenever I did, I'd  always  face  towards  the\n   little
  \ pond beside the forest, where a couple of beavers\n   had built a dam.  Those
  beavers were named Marge and  An-\n   dy, and they were good friends of Gracey and
  Maureen, our\n   two cows.  On winter mornings, I'd go out to milk  Gracey\n   and
  \ Maureen  and  I'd have to thaw out their udders with\n   boiled linseed oil that
  I  bought  with  money  I  earned\n   delivering  the  Globe and Mail.  We were
  too poor to af-\n   ford any toilet paper of our own, but we were part  of  a\n
  \  co-operative  that  shared  an Eatons catalog, and once a\n   month, while I
  was on my rounds sharpening scissors,  I'd\n   share  a  cup  of  tea with the neighbours
  and tell them,\n   \"Some day I'll move to the city.\"\n\n7-TOMMY:  Granddad, what
  did that have to do with the show?\n\n8-GRANDDAD:  Well, Tommy, that's a good question.
  \ To answer\n   it, I think I'll tell you a little story.\n\n9-TOMMY:  The show's
  starting again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI:2b Page 1              FASS 1986            86/01/13-10:46\n\f\n"
