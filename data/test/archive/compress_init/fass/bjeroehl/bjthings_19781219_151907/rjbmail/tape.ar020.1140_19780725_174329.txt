:content: ! "33 fass         Thu Jul  6 1978  21:08 *\nHi.  My name is Bernie -- I'm
  the guy that Rohan may have mentioned\nconcerning the tape of the Adventure program.
  \ I picked it up on my\nway through Toronto today (I'm here 'till Sunday from Montreal).
  \ I\nhave given the tape to a friend of mine named Rob White (RJWHITE).\nWe tried
  compiling it, but got a lot of error messages.  I understand\nfrom Rohan that you
  would be interested in having it on the GAMES li-\nbrary, which may be necessary
  since the file is about 150 llinks.\nPlease contact me at your earliest opportunity
  with more information.\nThanks.\n                            --Bernie\n\n"
