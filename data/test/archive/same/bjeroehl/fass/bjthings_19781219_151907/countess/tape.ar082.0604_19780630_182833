:content: ! "Greetings once again, Countess Katya!\n     The script Mr. Lee refers
  to is at least two or three years old.  It is \nneither this past year's show, nor
  (I suspect) the previous year's.  As you\nmay (or may not) recall, this past year's
  show had to do with gangsters, while\nFASS of the previous year was on a Star Trek
  motif.  So far as I know, only\nthose two scripts are readily available.  This past
  year's is in a formal form\n(i.e. in a plastic ringbinder) and looking rather good.
  The Star Trek  script is\ncurrently archived on the Honeywell, but I can have a
  copy printed up in no time\nif he wants it.  I think the script he's after is the
  year prior to the Star Trek\nshow...I don't know if copies of that script are still
  around, but I can ask. \n     I'll be getting into Waterloo some time in early September...exactly
  when,\nI don't know.   I'll be glad to help out with Orientation, if you tell me
  what\nmust be done.  One thing that greatly surprised me upon my arrival in Waterloo\nis
  how un-close the various groups are.  While there are some obvious overlaps,\nI
  had expected far more mathsoc/mathnews/watsfic/fed/board people to be involved\nin
  FASS...do you know Oscar (Nierstrasz)?\n     I have some friends in W'loo connected
  with something that I just recently\nlearned is called \"Imprint\".  I was very
  involved with it before my return to\nMontreal for the summer, and am glad to see
  it off the ground.  Any WATSFICers\n(WATSFICians?) interested?  Maybe you could
  spread the word...AIA members need\nnot apply (they already have a rag of their
  own).\n     Mr. Lee can reach me at BJEROEHL or (much less frequently) FASS.  Oscar's\nuserid
  is OMNIERSTRASZ, though he hasn't been on in a while.\n     Keep in touch, fair
  Countess.  I'm on about twice a week (though this is \nsubject to change, especially
  in August when I'll be about 50 miles from the \nnearest terminal).\n                                   Sincerely,\n
  \                                      Mr. Bernie Roehl\n"
