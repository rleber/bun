For three years now, Rocko and the boys have been getting
together for the weekly installment of Gangbusters,
for a little talk, and for some easy drinking brew.

...the Sound of the City, during CandleLight and Wine, where everywhere
in the air it's the sweet sound of Arts Students, waxing their skis for
reading week.  And in Our Waterloo, you're still tuned to CKMS, Radio
Waterloo, 94.7 on your FM dial!
.v1
I think we're getting a little interference.

Yes, we have another evening of painstakingly planned pastoral pieces
to interest the classical listener, followed immediately by the
gore and carnage of the 8 O'clock NEWS - all brought to you by the
station that cares, CKMS, Radio Waterloo, 94.8 on your FM dial!
.mz
Gangbusters isn't on FM anyway, dummy.  FM hasn't been invented yet.
Let me do it. (RADIO NOISES)  You have to switch bands, that's all.

At the tone which follows
the wolf howl, the bird call, and the sound of one hand clapping
you will realize it is ten-to-two, CKMS Standard Time...
.ri
How come all you get is Radio Waterloo??
.gz
I've heard
they're having a fight with the ham radio station of the amateur radio club.
It seems to be quite a power struggle.

Ah, a real battle of watts, eh?
.ra
Attention! Attention! This is a NORAD air defence test, brought to you live on
tape by CKMS, Radio Waterloo, everywhere on your radio dial...

And take the money fast.
