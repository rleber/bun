I'm trying to compile a list of songs (and parts of songs) used in Fass 80.
The list I have so far is in eksiegerman/fass/songs (in chronological
order of first appearance in the show). Each line looks like
act-scene:line:type description
where
line refers to qed line in the scene, rather than speech number
type is s for a song (one with a .sb macro, for those who wrote)
    and f for a song fragment (any other musical thing that existed)
desc is, for a type s, "fass name" "real name"
    and, for a type f, whatever I could think of to say.
If you have a couple of minutes, could you please look at this file, and,
if you can think of any that I've missed, let me know?
Thanx muchly.
             -eks
