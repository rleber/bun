and this time, he says he has a meat cleaver.
She gets scared and hangs up, then calls the cops.
The police say they're going to trace the next call
and she's supposed to keep him talking.
So about half an hour later, he calls again.
And he's saying how he just got out of prison,
when suddenly the operator breaks in and says,
"Get out of the house, he's on the upstairs extension!"
The girl goes running out the door and he's after her with this big meat
cleaver and he's getting closer and closer...

I have a story.
There's a guy and girl out parking on a back road, and they hear on the radio
that some maniac has escaped from an asylum and he's in the neighbourhood.
He's called the Hook 'cause instead of a hand, he has this razor-sharp
hook.
The girl wants to go home, but the guy says, "Don't be scared, I'll
protect you."
After a while, they start necking until they hear this branch
break in the woods.
He says it's probably just a raccoon or something, but she says she's going
to scream if they don't leave right away.
The guy gets mad and just guns the car out of there.
They get home and he gets out to open the door for her, and there, hanging
from her door handle is this razor-sharp hook.
