(SCENE  OPENS  WITH MATT, DINAH, SNAPPER, AND SQUEAKY SEATED
ABOUT  ONE  OF  AT  LEAST  TWO  TABLES  IN  THE   FRONT   OF
A.L.I.C.E.'S  RESTAURANT.   WAITRESSES  APRIL, MAY, AND JUNE
ARE WORKING IN THE BACKGROUND.)

MMMAAATTTTTT HHHAAATTTTTTEEERRR:  ...and so  when  they  found  out  that  their
   shingles  weren't  painted  blue,  they  ate macaroni and
   cranberry sauce till the rooster crowed twice on the hil-
   lside.   And that's why to this day the Lions' club has a
   heart fund.

(AT THIS EVERYONE BUT SQUEAKY LAUGHS AT THE JOKE.)

DDDIIINNNAAAHHH:  (STILL  LAUGHING)   Ah,  that  was  very  witty, Mr.
   Hatter.

SSSQQQUUUEEEAAAKKKYYY FFFRRROOOMMMMMMEEE:   Yes, if I hear Matt tell another joke like
   that one, I'll turn into a frog and croak.

SSSNNNAAAPPPPPPEEERRR MMMOOOCCCKKKYYY:  Oh, please don't do that, Squeaky.

DDDIIINNNAAAHHH:  Ms.Fromme is just being vulgar.   Here,  Miss Mocky,
   have some more of this excellent tea.

SSSNNNAAAPPPPPPEEERRR:  Well... if you really want me to...

MMMAAATTTTTT:   Of  course,  she does!  How you got to be so indeci-
   sive, only your hair dresser knows for  sure.   What  are
   you  anyway,  Snapper,  a  man or a mock?  (LOOKS AT HIM)
   Oh, never mind.  What we need is a plan!

SSSNNNAAAPPPPPPEEERRR:  (HESITANTLY) A p- p- plan?

MMMAAATTTTTT:  Yes, we need a plan to rescue our  good  friend Alice
   from  prison  where  the  his and her highnesses have un-
   fairly placed her.

DDDIIINNNAAAHHH:  Isn't it horrible?  My Alice could  never  have kid-
   napped  the  princess.   Just  thinking about it makes my
   back fur curl all the way to my armpits.

SSSQQQUUUEEEAAAKKKYYY:  Now who's being vulgar?

SSSNNNAAAPPPPPPEEERRR:  B-But, I thought we were just  going  to celebrate
   the  Oktoberfest  Tea  and  Biscuit  Festival.   Breaking
   people out of prisons is dangerous!

SSSQQQUUUEEEAAAKKKYYY:  You're such a coward, Snapper.  And  a  moron too.
   I  don't  think  there  could be anyone more moronic than
   you.

(RIGHT ON CUE, THE TWEEDLES ENTER THE RESTAURANT.)

BBBOOOTTTHHH TTTWWWEEEEEEDDDLLLEEESSS:  Hallo!

TTTWWWEEEEEEDDDLLLEEE-DDDUUUMMM:  Tweedle-Dum...

TTTWWWEEEEEEDDDLLLEEE-IIINNNCCCRRREEEDDDIIIBBBLLLYYY-SSSTTTUUUPPPIIIDDD:     ...and    Tweedle-Incredibly-
   Stupid...

BBBOOOTTTHHH TTTWWWEEEEEEDDDLLLEEESSS:  (BOWING) ...at your service!

DDDIIINNNAAAHHH:  Where have you two been?  You and the Duchess should
   have been here half an hour ago.  What held you up?

DDDUUUMMM:  A masked man in a clam costume.

SSSQQQUUUEEEAAAKKKYYY:  (ASIDE TO DINAH) You should  know  better  than to
   ask Dum and Incredibly-Stupid questions.

SSSTTTUUUPPPIIIDDD:   No,  really,  a bivalve wearing a tacky black mask
   really did hold us up.

DDDUUUMMM:  Poor man must have been shy.

SSSTTTUUUPPPIIIDDD:  I'd be shy too if I wore a clam costume.

SSSQQQUUUEEEAAAKKKYYY:  Get on with the story, you idiots!

DDDUUUMMM:  Righto!  Anyway this poor sole desired all  the pearls
   that  the  Duchess  possessed,  apparently  just  for the
   halibut...

SSSTTTUUUPPPIIIDDD:  It looked like  we  were  in  a  pickerel,  but the
   Duchess  smelt  something fishy and positively refused to
   give them up.

DDDUUUMMM:  The chips were down, but he took heart and squirted us
   with quick drying tartar sauce to clam us up.

MMMAAATTTTTT:   Sounds  like you were in a pretty kettle of fish.  I
   suppose this clam-person just sat there and  watched  the
   sauce harden about you, waiting with baited breath.

I:3              Better Holmes and Gardens            Page 3

DDDIIINNNAAAHHH:  Baited breath?

MMMAAATTTTTT:  Maybe he'd been eating worms.

SSSTTTUUUPPPIIIDDD:  No, as a matter of  fact  that's  just  what didn't
   happen.   Just  as  we were about to become the Village's
   Friday special, two caped crusaders arrived on the scene,
   released  us,  and  chased  the clam off into the horizon
   where they no doubt banged their heads.

DDDUUUMMM:  The poor Duchess was in a dreadful state.

MMMAAATTTTTT:  Minnesota?

DDDUUUMMM:  She kept saying over and over,  "Who  was  that masked
   clam?".  We had to hospitalize the poor dear.

DDDIIINNNAAAHHH:   How  shocking!   Mr. Hatter, aren't you shocked and
   appalled at these goings-on?

MMMAAATTTTTT:  Not at all, m'dear Dinah.  The same thing happened to
   me last week.

(HOLMES  AND GARDENS ENTER THE RESTAURANT AND MAKE THEIR WAY
TO A TABLE.)

MMMAAARRRVVVIIINNN GGGAAARRRDDDEEENNNSSS:  Gosh, Holmes, it  sure  is  good  to  relax
   after that bout with Oysterman.

BBBEEETTTTTTEEERRR HHHOOOLLLMMMEEESSS:   Yes,  the  commissioner can handle him now.
   It'll be some time before he causes trouble for us again.

GGGAAARRRDDDEEENNNSSS:  Why do they do it, Holmes?

HHHOOOLLLMMMEEESSS:  The criminal mind... works in strange ways, Marvin.
   We  must always be alert against evil-doers.  Crime knows
   no holiday.

GGGAAARRRDDDEEENNNSSS:  He's sick, that's what  he  is.   I  can't imagine
   _e_v_e_r  wanting to _s_t_e_a_l.  Yuck, phooey.  It was sure lucky
   for us that we were wearing our grease-repellant costumes
   when he tried to deep-fry us.

HHHOOOLLLMMMEEESSS:   Yes,  it would have been a filet worse than death.
   But enough of such batters.  It was an excellent  sugges-
   tion  of  yours  to visit a restaurant.  Now, if we could
   just attract the attention of one of these waitresses...

(DURING THE NEXT CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE WAITRESSES, HOLMES
AND GARDENS ATTEMPT TO ATTRACT THEIR ATTENTION.)

AAAPPPRRRIIILLL SSSHHHOOOWWWEEERRRSSS:   Isn't  this the most boring job you've ever
   had?

MMMAAAYYY FFFLLLOOOWWWEEERRRSSS:  I've had one that's more boring.

JJJUUUNNNEEE BBBUUUGGG:  What?

MMMAAAYYY:  Registrar at the Chevron School of Journalism.

JJJUUUNNNEEE:  I used to have a boring job too.

AAAPPPRRRIIILLL:  What was that?

JJJUUUNNNEEE:  _S_t_u_d_e_n_t at the Chevron School of Journalism.

AAAPPPRRRIIILLL:  I still wish we could liven things up around here.

JJJUUUNNNEEE:  How be if we take someone's order?

AAAPPPRRRIIILLL:  Hey, that's a good idea!

(THEY GO TO HOLMES AND GARDENS.)

   Hi handsome, what'll ya have?

HHHOOOLLLMMMEEESSS:  I'll have a chicken salad sandwich.

GGGAAARRRDDDEEENNNSSS:  And I'll have an egg salad sandwich.

(ALL THREE WAITRESSES WRITE THIS DOWN.)

MMMAAAYYY:  One chicken, one egg...  Anything to drink, sirs?

HHHOOOLLLMMMEEESSS:  No, thank you.  Liquor dulls the mind  and inhibits
   the rational processes.

JJJUUUNNNEEE:  That explains engineers!

HHHOOOLLLMMMEEESSS:  You can all go away now.

(WAITRESSES WALK AWAY TOWARDS ORDER WINDOW.)

JJJUUUNNNEEE:  Egg salad and chicken salad!  How dull can you get?

MMMAAAYYY:   I  know  how  we  can  liven things up -- we'll order
   something different.

AAAPPPRRRIIILLL:  Sure!  (SHOUTING OUT  ORDER  WINDOW)  Ordering roast
   trunk of tree-dwelling elephant with ecstasy sauce.

MMMAAAYYY:    Ordering   jellied   armadillo   brains  with unborn
   mushrooms!

JJJUUUNNNEEE:  Ordering souffle of gnat's kidneys on the half-shell.

   Hank the Herald, page boy sings
   Declarations from your king.
   Count Paul Bearer's statue, golden,
   Just this hour has been stolen.
   If you catch this unjust thief --
   All he left were these false teeth --
   You will get your just reward:
   Knightship from his vorpal sword.
   Riches, titles offers he.
   And a Loblaws' shopping spree.

(HANK EXITS)

GGGAAARRRDDDEEENNNSSS:  The fiend!

HHHOOOLLLMMMEEESSS:  We know only too well who would  leave  false teeth
   at  a  robbery.  It can only be our arch-nemesis, the In-
   visible Cat Burglar!

GGGAAARRRDDDEEENNNSSS:  Holy hand grenade, Holmes!

MMMAAATTTTTT:  Do my eyes deceive me or is  that  the  famous Holmes
   and Gardens at the next table?

HHHOOOLLLMMMEEESSS:   No  doubt your eyes do deceive you, therefore it's
   the latter.

DDDIIINNNAAAHHH:  Oh, this is such a piece of luck.  We do  so  need a
   detective to prove Alice's innocence.

HHHOOOLLLMMMEEESSS:   I'm  sorry, but as you have just heard, Count Paul
   Bearer's statue has been stolen.   I  must  recover  that
   before I take on any other cases.

GGGAAARRRDDDEEENNNSSS:  (RUBBING HANDS) We have to get that fiend!

MMMAAATTTTTT:   But  we  were  so _h_o_p_i_n_g that you could help us free
   Alice.

HHHOOOLLLMMMEEESSS:  Gee, I hate to see anyone  so  disappointed.  Let's
   see what I can do.  Marvin, hand me a placemat.

GGGAAARRRDDDEEENNNSSS:  There's no placemat, Holmes.

HHHOOOLLLMMMEEESSS:  Then I'll just have to make do.

(HE  GRABS  THE  HANDKERCHIEF  FROM  SNAPPER'S HANDS, WRITES

   Here's my secretary's number.  I should  be  available  a
   few scenes from now.

SSSQQQUUUEEEAAAKKKYYY:  That might be too late.  Why don't we help you get
   the statue, and then you can help us free Alice?

MMMAAATTTTTT:  I've got a better idea: why don't  you  help  us free
   Alice after we help you get the statue?

(WAITRESSES  APPROACH  FROM  ORDER  WINDOW,  TWO OF WHOM ARE
CARRYING SANDWICHES TO HOLMES' TABLE.)

SSSQQQUUUEEEAAAKKKYYY:  Oh yes, that's a _m_u_c_h better idea.

(THE WAITRESSES PLACE THE SANDWICHES ON THE TABLE  AND  HEAD
BACK FOR THE KITCHEN.)

HHHOOOLLLMMMEEESSS:  Then it's agreed.  (TURNS TO WAITRESSES) Hey, you!

(WAITRESSES  TURN  AROUND  AND  STOP.   HOLMES POINTS TO HIS
TABLE.)

   Which came first... the chicken or the egg?

AAAPPPRRRIIILLL:  Neither of 'em, they're both  limburger  and sauerk-
   raut.

TTTWWWEEEEEEDDDLLLEEESSS:  Oh boy, our favourite!  (THEY RUSH TO THE TABLE)

HHHOOOLLLMMMEEESSS:  What do you make of this, Marvin?

GGGAAARRRDDDEEENNNSSS:   Limburger  starts  with  limb which is on a tree,
   which is held up by roots,  which  was  written  by  Alex
   Haley,  and  that leads to Haley's Comet, which goes past
   the sun, whose antonym is moon, which is  made  of  green
   cheese.   Limburger  is a cheese!  Great Calculus!  We're
   right back where we started.  Now we're in hot water.

HHHOOOLLLMMMEEESSS:  In hot water?

GGGAAARRRDDDEEENNNSSS:  Yes, we're in trouble.

HHHOOOLLLMMMEEESSS:  With a capital 'T'.

GGGAAARRRDDDEEENNNSSS:  And that rhymes with 'P'.

HHHOOOLLLMMMEEESSS:  And that stands for pool.

GGGAAARRRDDDEEENNNSSS:  Heated pool!  Oh no, hot water again.

HHHOOOLLLMMMEEESSS:  Wait!  What can you make with hot water?

GGGAAARRRDDDEEENNNSSS:   Coffee  and  tea...coffee  and tea...c-a-t...cat!
   Why  this  is a message from the diabolical Invisible Cat
   Burglar!

HHHOOOLLLMMMEEESSS:   Correct!   It  seems  our   suspicions   have been
   verified.   And  how do you understand the second half of
   the puzzle?

GGGAAARRRDDDEEENNNSSS:  Sauerkraut...he's saying he's  a  sour puss...he's
   mad at somebody...  another victim...kraut...Holy Gott im
   Himmel!  That means German!

HHHOOOLLLMMMEEESSS:  And that starts with -G...

GGGAAARRRDDDEEENNNSSS:  (IMPRESSED BY HOLMES' LOGIC) Gee...

HHHOOOLLLMMMEEESSS:  Precisely! And how many g's are there  in  'The Ar-
   gyle gargoyle gargles Gershwin gorgeously'?

GGGAAARRRDDDEEENNNSSS:     Hmm...let    me   count...wait!  Count...German
   count...Holey Swiss Cheese!  He's going to  attack  Count
   Paul Bearer, the justice of the teeth from Transylvania!

HHHOOOLLLMMMEEESSS:   Exactly  as  I  deduced  it.   The  Count has more
   ivories than a grand piano.  That villainous feline would
   give up his eye teeth for those suckers.

SSSNNNAAAPPPPPPEEERRR:  H- How are we going to get to the Count's castle?

DDDIIINNNAAAHHH:  I have a station-wagon parked out back.

HHHOOOLLLMMMEEESSS:   Right,  we  have no time to lose.  To the cat car,
   Marvin!
