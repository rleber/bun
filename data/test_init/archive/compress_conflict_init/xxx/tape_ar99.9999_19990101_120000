  ENTERS HOLDING ROPE ATTACHED\nTO BOOBIES. THEY HOP INTO THE ROOM, STILL TIED BACK
  TO BACK)\n\n.rb\nCome along, I haven't got all day! The Satirize crew will be\nhere
  any second, and I don't think they'd take it too kindly \nif they knew they were
  being spied upon.\n\n(SOUND OF APPROACHING FELLOWSHIP)\n\nDrat! Quick, behind this
  doorway, and not a word out of you.\n\n(THE FELLOWSHIP ENTERS)\n\n.ty\nSo this is
  how a Winkle lives. It's awfully large - by Munchkin\nstandards. That main doorway
  must have been all of 5 feet high.\n\n.je\nFeet?\n\n.su\nAn archaic system of measurement
  used in mediaevil Earth, sir.\nI'd estimate roughly 3 Galactic Standard cubits.\n\n(A
  SINGING MUNCHKIN ENTERS)\n\n.aa SM\n     *********************************\n     ***to
  the tune of \"Prepare Ye\"***\n     *********************************\n     Prepare
  for the Winkle of Fed (4 TIMES)\n\n(MUNCHKINS POP OUT OF DOORWAYS, THE VOM, THE
  TRAP AND ANY OTHER\nFREE ORIFICE IN TIME TO THE FOLLOWING VERSE)\n\n.aa ALL~ERICS\n
  \    Diddle-iddle-um, da-da.\n     Diddle-iddle-um, da-da.\n     Prepare for the
  Winkle of Fed. (4 TIMES)\n\n(DURING THE COURSE OF THIS SONG THE WINKLE HAS ENTERED
  QUIETLY AND\nIS STANDING WITH THE FELLOWSHIP, WAITING FOR HIS BIG ENTRANCE.\nIT
  DOESN'T COME, OF COURSE)\n\n.wi\n(TO TOROTHY) Pretty snazzy intro, eh, kid?\n\n.ty\nHuh?\n\n.wi\nI
  said pretty snazzy intro, eh? Really builds up the excitement for\nmy big entry.\n\n.ty\nYour
  big entry? You mean you're the Winkle of Fed?\n\n.wi\nYou were expecting maybe Phil
  Silvers? Really, Torothy.\n\n.ty\nHow did you know my-\n\n.wi\nHow did I know your
  name?\nOh, I know all about you and the rest of the Fellowship; how you\ncrashed
  here and why you've come to see me.\n\n.ga\nHi, Perry.\n\n.wi\nHi, Gabby.\n\n.je\nYou
  know each other?\n\n.ga\nSure, we're buddies from way back. Perry used to use me
  in his \nmagic show : I was in the guillotine trick.\n\n.wi\nIllusion, Gabby. Illusion.
  There are no tricks in my show.\n\n.je\nShow? What's all this about a show?\n\n.wi\nThis
  show!\n\n(GESTURES TO MUNCKINS. THEY SMILE)\n\nNow right here is where\nI make my
  big entrance, and then we bring on the\nBanana Act and I do my magic routine.\n\n.su\nWhat's
  a Ba-\n\n.wi\nWhat's a Banana Act?\nI was hoping someone would ask me that. (CALLS
  OFFSTAGE)\nBring on the Banana Act!\n\n(JUGGLERS AND MAGIC ACT)\n\n.wi\n(TO TOROTHY)
  Pretty snazzy act, eh, kid?\nNow let's see; you're here because you want a ring
  modulator, right?\n\n.je\nRight.\n\n.wi\nYou need the ring modulator to fix your
  transporter, right?\n\n.je\nRight.\n\n.wi\nYou want me to get you one, right?\n\n.je\nRight.
  You can help us, right?\n\n.wi\nWrong.\n\n.je\nWrong?\n\n.wi\nYes. Good day! (STARTS
  TO LEAVE)\n\n.ga\nJust a second, Wink old buddy.\n\n(THE REST OF THE FELLOWSHIP
  WINKS; LEFTY SNAPS HIS FINGERS)\n\nIn these days of social unrest and revolutionary
  fervour, do you\nthink it's wise to admit that there's something you can't do?\n\n(AT
  THE SOUND OF THESE WORDS TOLSTOY'S EYES LIGHT UP)\n\n.wi\nThere's nothing I can't
  do.\n\n.ga\nLook: you know there's nothing you can't do, and I know\nthere's nothing
  you can't do, but all the Munchkins will\nknow is that you can't even supply these
  people with a lousy ring \nmodulator.\n\n.je\nActually, we'd like a fairly good
  one if it's at all possible.\n\n.wi\nWell...\n\n.to\nWhat's all this about \"social
  unrest and revolutionary f-\"\n\n.wi\nSocial unrest and revolutionary fervour?\nNothing,
  nothing.\n\n.ga\nNothing!\nThreats are made on your life every day, and you're on
  the verge\nof being thrown out of office by your people and you say \"Nothing.\"\n\n.wi\nWell,
  when you put it that way... all right, I'll get you your ring\nmodulator, but first
  you must do something for me. You must find -\nmy page!\n\n.hu\nYou mean you don't
  have the script memorized yet?\n\n(BY THIS TIME SURU IS ASLEEP)\n\n.ga\nNot that
  kind of page, my dear. The Winkle is talking about a \nflesh and blood, human page.\n\n.hu\nWait
  until Jock finds out! He can finally write his book.\n\n.ga\nI don't think you get
  my meaning. You see, the page is the only\nmeans of mass communication on the planet
  Fed. They travel everywhere,\ntelling the Munchkins things like what kind of beer
  to buy, where\nto go for birth control devices and termpapers and such, and what\nmovies
  to avoid.\n\n.ty\nIs that all?\n\n.wi\nPractically. Every week they make their rounds,
  spreading opinion\nand gossip far and wide.\n\n(TOLSTOY IS NOW ASLEEP)\n\n.hu\nIs
  there no way to simply get the plain f-\n\n.wi\nGet the plain  facts on this planet?\nCertainly
  there's the true page.\n\n(HUARYU OPENS HER MOUTH TO SPEAK)\n\nWhat's the true page?
  It's what I want you to find!\nIt's the only page that the people completely trust,\nand
  I can't keep their support unless I have it.\n\n.je\nYou mean you want us to-\n\n.wi\nExactly.
  I want you to split up and sarch the woods for the true\npage. Bring it back to
  me, and I'll get you your ring modulator.\n\n(HUARYU IS ASLEEP)\n\n.je\nHow will
  we-\n\n.wi\nHow will you recognize the true page? It's easy: he has absolutely\nno
  distinguishing characteristics. Oh, and another thing. Watch out\nfor this man.\n\n(PULLS
  OUT PICTURE FRAME BEHIND WHICH BRASSIERE IS STANDING)\n\n.je\nMacintosh!\n\n.wi\nHuh?
  You know-\n\n.je\nDo I know this person? Sure I do! He was on my ship and stole
  my\nboobies.\n\n.wi\nI'm afraid I'm somewhat puzzled by your race's anatomy. Could\nyou
  please clarify what you're saying?\n\n.je\n(QUICKLY)\nHe posed as our doctor, stole
  our passengers, escaped and came down to\nthe planet with us, and ran off in the
  confusion when\nwe found our nurse turned into a pizza.\n\n.wi\n(DAZED) Thanks for
  the clarification. Would you like to know-\n\n.je\n(YAWN) Yes, I'd like to know
  who he really is.\n\n.wi\nI wish you wouldn't interrupt me.\nHis real name is Robert
  Brassiere, and he's my arch enemy,\nthe man who's trying to overthrow me. He's pretty
  violent,\nand there's no telling what he might do if he found\nout you were helping
  me.\n\n(JERK IS ASLEEP)\n\n(YAWN) I suggest you and your people split up. There
  are\nquite a few places in and around the forest where you can check...\n(YAWN)...
  and then you can get back to me....ZZZZZZZZZZZ\n\n(WINKLE IS ASLEEP)\n.rb\n(LEAVES
  FRAME) So, they hope to get the page, do they?\nThey'll never find it before me!
  I'll have this planet\nup in arms before they know what hit them, and\nwith the
  boobies and the true page in my power the people\nwill acclaim me their ruler. Haha!\n\n(EVERYONE
  STARTS TO WAKE UP. BRASSIERE LEAVES)\n\n.to\nKeptain, was that you?\n\n.je\nI thought
  it was you. Oh well, no time to waste. Let's be off!\n\n.to\nWhere are we going?\n\n.je\nOff
  to the forest to find the page.\n\n.su\nWhat's a page?\n\n.hu\nAnd why are we going
  to a forest?\n\n.ty\nCaptain, could you repeat some of what was said? Dodo didn't
  hear\nall of it.\n\n.to\n(EYES LIGHT UP) Yes, start at the part about \"social unrest
  and \nrevolutionary fervour\".\n\n.je\nSomething tells me this is going to be a
  long day.\n\n(FADEOUT)\n\nfin\n"
