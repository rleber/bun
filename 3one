  .he ''FASS''- % -''ACT III SCENE I''

  .fo ''ACT III SCENE I''''FASS''

  Act 3, Scene 1 - On the Planet


  (WE BEGIN WITH A FROZEN REPLAY OF THE LAST SCENE OF ACT I.

  VOICE OVER.)


  .je

  Captain''s log, suppository - er...

  Captain''s log, supplemental.

  We have crashed down onto this planet: unknown, uncharted, uncivilized, unprotected.

  Even now,

  we can see in the distance a horde of what appears to be humanoids,

  armed with colossal weapons,

  although it is hard to say exactly how far away.

  It is impossible to beam up to the ship;

  we have only a few weapons with which to protect ourselves.

  Having forgotten to bring along any expendable crew members to

  throw at the enemy,

  we can only await our sure fate.

  (HE BOWS HIS HEAD)


  .to

  (COMES RUNNING OUT OF THE FARMHOUSE, LOOKS OUT AT THE WINGS) :

  Keptain, Keptain, what is it?


  .je

  Weren''t you listening just now?

  It''s an alien horde.


  .to

  Are they friendly aliens?


  .je

  They might be inclined to be,

  but somehow I don''t think they''ll take kindly to us landing

  on top of one of their people there.

  (HE POINTS TO THE HEAD STICKING OUT FROM UNDER THE HOUSE.)


  .to

  Lenin''s pajamas!

  (HE GOES OVER TO EXAMINE THE HEAD AND SHOES.)

  Well, I guess there''s nothing we can do for her now;

  she''s certainly dead.


  .ga

  AbI''m nabot dabead!


  .to

  Keptain, Keptain, it talked.


  .je

  What are you talking about, Ensign?

  She''s dead, the poor devil.


  .ga

  AbI''m nabot dabead!


  .to

  She''s saying something

  in some sort of strange foreign tongue.


  .ga

  That''s no strange foreign tongue, that''s High Munchkin.


  .hu

  Captain, she''s alive!


  .su

  But how can she survive with her body crushed under that house?


  .cl

  Oh, it''s likely not all that hard.


  .je

  Quiet, Nurse, or I''ll box your ears.

  All right, you there,

  where are we,

  what are you

  and why can you speak English like every other creature

  that we meet out here in space?


  .ga

  It''s not English, it''s low Munchkin.


  .je

  Munchkin?


  .ga

  Yes, this is the planet of Fed,

  inhabited entirely by Munchkins.


  .je

  Munchkins? Fed? What a stupid name for a planet!


  .ga

  Yeah, we get fed up with it too from time to time.


  .je

  And who are you?


  .hu

  Yes, Captain?


  .ga

  Her name''s Yes?


  .hu

  No, no, no, you''ve got it all wrong.


  .ga

  Well, Miss Wrong then.

  What negative names you people have.


  .hu

  No, no, no: Huaryu.


  .ga

  My name''s Gabandabalf.

  Oh, I get it,

  your first name is nonono,

  and your last name is Wrong.

  It must have been hell for you when they took roll call

  in public school.


  .je

  Gabandabalf...?


  .ga

  Or in high Munchkin,

  Gabababandabababalf.


  .je

  Whatever.

  Why couldn''t you have a simple name to remember like Smith or Tolstoy or-


  .to

  Yes?


  .je

  I wasn''t talking to you, Tchaikovsky.

  Now Ms. Smith-


  .su

  That''s Gabandabalf, Captain.


  .je

  All right. Ms. Captain, what are you doing under our house?


  .ga

  Pretending I''m a Foundation?


  .je

  Don''t be flippant with me; besides, Asimov did that years ago.


  .ga

  All right, all right,

  I was just sleeping for a while when all of a sudden I woke up

  and there you were.


  .ty

  Do you hurt anywhere?


  .ga

  Not particularly, why?


  .to

  Well, you are under the house and all, and it must have hurt a little.


  .ga

  I''m not under the house; it just missed me.


  .je

  Then, ahhh, ahhh, where''s the rest of you?


  .ga

  This is all of me.


  .su

  You mean you''re a head?


  .je

  We were looking for one of those a few hours ago.


  .ty

  How did that happen, Mr. Gabandabalf?


  .ga

  All this family planning business.

  My parents thought it would be wise to plan a head,

  and that''s what they got.


  .ty

  That''s terrible!


  .ga

  Oh, not so bad really.

  The munchkins are so dumb that they elected me Head Munchkin

  because they thought I was the only possible candidate.


  .hu

  The Munchkins are not very bright?


  .ga

  Bright? They don''t have the brains of a scriptwriter!


  (ALL GASP)


  .to

  And they''re coming over the hills now.

  To attack us?


  .ga

  Yes, if they''re in a nasty mood today.


  .to

  Can''t you do anything?


  .ga

  I''d like to help you, but as you can see I''m unarmed.


  .je

  Well, they''re a long way off yet.

  We''ve got time to hide.


  .ga

  They aren''t a long way off - they just look that way.

  In fact, they''re here now.


  (ENTER THE MUNCHKINS DOWN THE AISLES OF THE THEATRE)

  ***to the tune of "Pomp and Circumstance #1"***

  ***********************************************

  .in+5

  We are the Munchkins,

  This is Munchkinland.

  We think we''re exciting,

  Others think us bland.


  We are the Munchkins,

  This is Munchkinland.

  We don''t move at random,

  Most of this is planned;

  We''ve a slightly imbalanced

  Pi-tu-I-ta-ry gland.

  .in8

  .fi


  .ga

  Needless to say,

  they aren''t the greatest poets in the world either.

  And there''s nothing wrong with their glands;

  it''s a long story that they don''t like to be reminded of.


  (HUARYU IS BEING FELT UP BY THOUSANDS OF LITTLE MUNCHKINS)


  .hu

  Well, at least they appear friendly.


  .ga

  Frisky.

  Ah, here is my right

  hand man, Frabodabo;

  you can call him Lefty for short.


  (MURMERING AMONG THE MUNCHKINS.)


  Sorry, sorry.


  (LEFTY SHAKES HANDS WITH EVERYONE.)


  .ty

  How did he come to be like that?


  .ga

  Well, you see, his mother was warned during her pregnancy

  that the child might not turn out quite right.

  And as you know, forewarned is forearmed.

  When the kid came out with four arms,

  she threw two away,

  and that''s how Lefty and his brother set out in the world.


  .su

  Where''s his brother?


  .ga

  In the armed forces - a yardarm in the Navy. Real handsome kid.


  .su

  I see.


  .ga

  Now if you''ll just wait for a minute, I''ll talk to the Munchkins and tell

  them why you''re here.

  Abattabentabion, aball yabou pabeopable.


  .aa ALL~ERICS

  Rhabubabarb, rhabubabarb.


  .ga

  Thabese abare thabe vaboyabagabeurs abof thabe stabarshabip ....

  excuse me, what is the name of your starship?


  .je

  How did you know we were from a starship?


  .ga

  Don''t bog down the action, Bill.

  Never mind, I can see the name on the side of your craft.

  .... abof thabe stabarshabip Crabad Habouse, abits fabive yabear mabissabion ...


  .er

  Say it in low munchkin!


  .er

  Yeah, low munchkin.


  .ga

  Labow Mabunchkabin?

  Ahh, forget it.

  These people crashed here and you should be friendly to them.

  Got that, Eric?


  .aa ALL~ERICS

  Yabes.


  .je

  Why did they all answer to the name Eric?


  .ga

  That''s their name.


  .hu

  They''re all called Eric?


  .ga

  What''s wrong with Eric?


  .hu

  Nothing, I guess.


  .ga

  Yes, this is Eric the Tall, Eric the Fair, Eric the Red -


  .er

  I''m not Red!


  .je

  Enough of this.

  It''s all well and good to sit around here chewing the fat with Eric,

  but what we''ve got to do is find some way of getting a ring modulator for the transporter.


  .ga

  Well, if you want something like that on Fed, you''ll likely have to see the winkle.


  .to

  The Vinkle?


  .ga

  The Wonderful Winkle of Fed.


  .je

  I knew this was going to be a bad day.


  .ga

  The winkle is the only man on the planet who can find a ring modulator for you.


  .je

  Well, if he''s our only hope, I guess we go to see the Winkle.


  .ga

  Look, you''ll never get an audience with him

  unless I go with you.

  He''s very choosy in his audiences.


  .er

  (LOOKS AT AUDIENCE) Coulda fooled me!


  .aa ALL~ERICS

  Fool me!


  .je

  All right then, will you and your assistant join our party?


  .ga

  The Fellowship of the Ring Modulator?


  .je

  Something like that.


  .ga

  Come on, Lefty. We''ll take them to the Wiz.


  .aa ALL~ERICS

  Take! Wiz!


  .su

  Enthusiastic bunch. Reminds me of the Satirize.


  .je

  Are we ready, people?


  .ty

  Don''t you think that we should sing a song while we''re

  going off to see the Winkle?


  .je

  What would you suggest?


  .ty

  Weeeeeeeee''rrrrrrrreeee......


  .aa ALL

  Weeeeeeeee''rrrrrrreeeee......

  And stops my mind from wandering

  Where it will go....
