  (HOUSE LIGHTS DOWN.

  FOLLOW SPOT UP ON STAGE TO SHOW REGGIE TALKING INTO HIS MICROPHONE.

  STAGE IS SET UP WITH TWO SAFES SET INTO THE FLATS.)

  .ad

  (AS REGGIE IS TALKING, ONE SPY ALL IN WHITE COMES THROUGH THE AUDIENCE

  FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE SOUND BOOTH.)

  .ch rs

  (IN A SOFT VOICE)  Yes ladies and gentlemen we''re here for the

  first live coverage of the annual worldwide spy olympics.

  (NOTICING WHITEY)  And I believe this is

  one of the contestants of today''s first event,

  your favourite, the secret dossier stealing competition.

  .ld

  (AS THE REST OF THE LIGHTS COME UP, THE SPY IN WHITE PULLS

  A PAPER BAG OVER HIS HEAD.  THE INTERVIEW CONTINUES

  WITH THE SPY HIDDEN IN THIS MANNER.)

  .ex

  Darling disguise, sir.

  Reminds me of a certain entertainment reviewer for the Imprint.

  Now tell me, are there normally so few people at these contests?

  You seem to be the only contestant here today.

  .ch wh

  There aren''t many spies who are interested in taking part in

  such a public event.  I mean, spies prefer to work behind the scenes.

  .ad

  (A THOUSAND SPY HEADS SUDDENLY APPEAR AROUND THE STAGE:

  FROM BEHIND THE PIANO, THE TRAP DOOR, THE BIG DOORS AT THE BACK, ETC.

  THEY APPEAR FOR TWO SECONDS, THEN DISAPPEAR.)

  .ch rs

  So if every other spy avoided the contest because of publicity,

  why are you here?

  .ch wh

  There won''t really be any publicity; this contest is being

  broadcast by CKMS.

  .ad

  (BLACKY ENTERS, RUNS STRAIGHT TOWARDS ONE OF THE SAFES, AND

  BEGINS TO TWIRL THE DIAL.)

  .ch rs

  Just a minute, ma''am, the contest hasn''t quite started yet.

  .ch bl

  Oh.  Sorry.

  .ch rs

  Would you mind joining us, ma''am?

  .ch bl

  Why, are you coming apart?

  .ch rs

  Very witty, ma''am.

  Well ladies and gentlemen, we''ve been talking with...

  (POINTS MICROPHONE AT WHITEY)

  .ch wh

  John Smith.

  .ch rs

  ...and... (POINTS MICROPHONE AT BLACKY)

  .ch bl

  John Smith.

  .ch rs

  I see.

  Well, we''re about to start the contest, so good luck to you both

  and may the best spy win.  All set?   Then GO!

  .ad

  (REGGIE SHOOTS STARTING PISTOL IN AIR.  THERE IS A LOUD SQUAWK

  AND THE FAMOUS RUBBER CHICKEN FALLS FROM THE CANOPY.

  THE SPIES RUN TO EITHER SIDE OF THE STAGE AND PULL OUT THEIR TOOLS.

  BLACKY HAS A STETHOSCOPE AND EARMUFFS.  WHITEY HAS A HAND DRILL

  WITH A LONG EXTENSION CORD ON IT.

  HE PLUGS THE DRILL INTO THE OUTLET BETWEEN THE SAFES.

  WHILE THEY PREPARE, REGGIE GOES ON.)

  .ex

  The object of this contest is very simple, as are the contestants.

  The first spy to open the safe and steal its top-secret contents is

  the winner and folks, anything goes!

  And our contestants have selected their tools now.

  John Smith has chosen a drill.  It looks like he''s using

  the good old brute force and ignorance method.

  Beside him, John Smith is using a stethoscope.

  It''s obvious that she likes to do things with style and finesse.

  I''m sure we''ll see a real fight for the title tonight!

  .ad

  (THE TWO SPIES START TO WORK ON THEIR RESPECTIVE SAFES.

  WHITEY SETS UP HIS DRILL AND STARTS TO USE IT TO DRILL AROUND THE SAFE.

  HE MAKES A LOUD DRILL NOISE, BRRUMM, BRUMM.

  IN A FEW MOMENTS, HE SETS DOWN THE DRILL, PUTS SOME DYNAMITE

  AGAINST THE DOOR AND RUNS TO THE FRONT OF THE STAGE WITH A PLUNGER.

  HE HITS THE PLUNGER AND THERE IS A LOUD EXPLOSION THAT KNOCKS OPEN

  BOTH DOORS.  THE SPIES RUN INSIDE.)

  .ex

  Ladies and gentlemen, both spies have their safes open.

  All that remains is for them to steal the contents and

  reveal them here on stage.

  I wonder what they''ll find.

  .ad

  (BLACKY COMES OUT OF HER SAFE.)

  .ex

  Well, what was in there?

  Gold?  Jewellery?  Government Secrets?

  .ch bl

  (LEAPING OUT OF HIS DOOR)

  It''s...astounding.

  .ch wh

  Yes, it''s FASS ''81!

  .ad

  (THE DOORS SWING OPEN AND THE ENTIRE CAST STREAMS IN FOR THE

  OPENING SONG.)

  .sb "OPENING SONG" "YANKEE DOODLE DANDY"

  This is the one and only FASS show

  Don''t waste your time on any drugs or booze

  We''re bound to give you a high

  We''ve got talent yet still hidden

  We want to show it all to you

  .ve 4

  Take your seats and clap your hands

  Get in with the rhythm

  We want to share it all with you.

  .ve 6

  We''ve got actors, singers, dancers,

  They''ll make your senses start to spin

  A story written just with you in mind

  Based upon sex, crime, and sin.

  Full of puns and silly satire

  Sure to make you lose your mind

  .ve 3

  Got your money, too late now

  You will have to suffer

  Na Na, Na, Na, Na Na, Na, Na.

  .ve 6

  Here''s the lovely FASS sweethearts

  And the studs that make them sigh

  We''ve worked all year to perfect this show

  Trying to make this verse rhyme

  All our costumes now are finished

  The props are in their proper place

  .ve 4

  Love our techies, love them all

  They work so hard to make it

  When you get them into bed

  All they do is fake it.

  .ve 5

  Let''s go on now with the show

  Hope that it will seize you

  Hope that we will entertain

  We want for it to please you...

  (...REPEAT LAST LINE IN CONGA-FASHION EXIT...)
