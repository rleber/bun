  pub.\n.in 5\n.sp\n     ....CHORUS....\n.sp\nIn a couple of days, we will all forget
  our lines\nAssuming we don't mess things up\nAnd forget them ahead of time\n(Ho,
  Ho, Ho, Ho)\n.sp\n.in 3\nHappy ever after 'cuz the show is done\nWe'll take off
  all our make-up and our shoes\nYou will leave the theatre and you'll head for home,\nWe
  will head out to the party and the booze.\n.sp\n.in 5\n     ....CHORUS...\n.sp\nAnd
  if you want more giggles\nCome back in eighty-two.  Wooh!\n.ex\n.es\n"
