  Excuse me, but I''m looking for the, uhh...

  .ch cp

  You go out the vom, down the hall until you get to the big glass doors...

  .ch gr

  No no, I''m looking for the war room.

  .ch pp

  Are you sure? You look a little constipated to me.

  .ch cp

  (TO PARTS) A dog with diarrhea would look constipated to you.

  .ch pp

  What do you know about dogs?  I bet you don''t even know how to make

  a dog go meow.

  .ch cp

  How?

  .ch pp

  (WITH PROPER MOTIONS)  Take it up to a buzz saw and go "Meowww!"

  .ch gr

  Yes sir!

  .ch cp

  Get lost, punk!

  .ch gr

  Yes sir!

  But first, I have to deliver a message to General Degree in the war room.

  .ch pp

  What''s the message?

  .ch gr

  It''s a secret.

  .ch cp

  What''s the secret?

  .ch gr

  It''s about the Fassablanca toy company. They''re sending...

  .ch cp

  Uh, Private, why don''t you see if the general is busy.

  .ch pp

  Why me? I always get the tough assignments.

  .ch cp

  I went last time. It''s your turn.

  .ch pp

  Oh, all right.

  .ad

  (PARTS EXITS INTO THE OFFICE.)

  .ch cp

  Sooo, what''s this Fassablanca toy company up to anyway?

  .ch gr

  The Fassablanca toy company has developed a new secret weapon that threatens

  the very democratic basis for our society.

  A device so fiendish in its creation and so destructive in its operation

  that it must be stopped.

  .ch cp

  What kind of fiendish device?

  .ch gr

  A long distance lie detector.  Works great for televised political speeches.

  .ch cp

  Listen, you snitch, I have some very good friends who would be upset

  if you delivered that information.

  And they don''t play games at the Fassablanca toy company.

  .ad

  .ch gd

  Yes dear.

  .ch hh

  And drop by the vet''s and pick up the cat.

  .ch gd

  Yes dear.

  .ch hh

  And Harry, my mother is coming to stay with us for a while because

  her house in Tonnawanda burned down.

  .ch gd

  But, but...

  .ch hh

  No buts, Harry, or I''ll have yours barbecued for breakfast.

  I''ve already told mother she could come.

  .ch gd

  Yes dear.

  .ch hh

  And don''t be late for dinner tonight.

  .ch gd

  Yes dear. I mean, no dear.

  (PUNISHMENT RUSHES IN)

  .ch cp

  General, there''s this Grinchley guy outside who wants to talk to you.

  He says it''s urgent.

  .ch kc

  Grinchley?

  Is he wearing a loud tasteless Hawaiian shirt and carrying an

  obnoxious Poloroid Camera?

  .ch cp

  Yeah, that''s him.

  .ch kc

  He''s one of Santa Claus'' little helpers...

  Maybe you should see him, Harry.

  .ch gd

  (GROWLING) Okay.  Santa Claus, Santa Claus.

  Wasn''t he called St. Nicholas once?  Nicholas -- that''s a

  Commie name if ever I heard one. Send him in.

  .ad

  (PUNISHMENT GOES OUT TO GET GRINCHLEY AND PARTS.

  KITTY STAYS ON THE DESK, PREENING.

  EXXON ENTERS AND STANDS BEHIND GENERAL DEGREE.)

  .ch gd

  (INTO INTERCOM)

  Exxon, get in here on the double.

  .ch ex

  You wanted me, sir?

  .ch gd

  (TURNING AROUND WITH A START)

  I''d like to see the report on the interrogation of

  that pizza man we just finished grilling.

  .ch ex

  It''s on your desk, sir.

  .ad

  (GENERAL DEGREE GINGERLY EXTRACTS THE REPORTS FROM BENEATH KITTY

  AND BEGINS READING. PUNISHMENT, PARTS, AND GRINCHLEY ENTER.)

  .ch gd

  So, Grinko, what''s so urgent that you had to interrupt my top level meeting?

  .ch gr

  I represent a foreign power friendly to us all.

  (RECOGNIZES KITTY AND LOOKS AT KITTY AND THEN AT PUNISHMENT)

  I, uh, well, ...

  .ch kc

  You have something to say, Grinchley? I think the General would be

  most interested to hear your story.

  .ch gr

  Yes Mrs.Claus, I mean yes sir, ma''am, uhh...

  .ch kc

  Spit it out.

  .ch gr

  The Fassablanca toy company is...

  .ch cp

  Go ahead, Grinchley.

  .ch gr

  I can''t.

  .ch kc

  Why not?

  .ad

  (GRINCHLEY NODS AT BEAR.)

  .ex

  Is that what''s bothering you?

  .ad

  (SHE GRABS THE BEAR AND PUNCHES IT ACROSS THE STAGE.)

  .ex

  Carry on, Grinchley.

  .ch gr

  The Fassablanca toy company has invented a device capable of

  measuring the truth of anything politicians say.

  .ch gd

  So what?

  .ch gr

  It can also measure the truth of anything that generals say.

  .ch gd

  Great Scott!  This is serious.

  If people knew the truth about me, I''d lose my job!

  .ch gr

  You''ve got it. Line-ups at the unemployment office...

  .ch gd

  Surely not!

  .ch gr

  Nassssty U.I.C. officials...

  .ch gd

  Horrors!

  .ch gr

  The influence of facts would destroy the

  entire structure of modern civilization.

  .ch gd

  Right.  We''d all be forced to tell the truth.

  By God, that''s... (HAND OVER HEART) that''s Unamerican.

  It must be a Commie plot!

  .ch kc

  So this Fassablanca toy company is just a front for the enemy, General?

  .ch gd

  Correct.

  .ch kc

  (DRIPPING WITH SATIRE OBVIOUS TO ALL EXCEPT GENERAL DEGREE)

  Harry, you''re such a military genius it makes my hormones shiver.

  (AS GENERAL DEGREE BEGINS TO SPEAK, THE LIGHTS FADE AND DEGREE IS

  PICKED OUT BY A SPOTLIGHT.

  THE TUNE "WHEN JOHNNY COMES MARCHING HOME AGAIN" IS GENTLY HUMMED IN

  THE BACKGROUND BY THE GENERAL''S MEN)

  .ch gd

  So this is their fiendish scheme.

  The Fassablanca toy company is in enemy hands, under their total control.

  We''ve met them in the trenches. We''ve met them on the beaches.

  We''ve met them in the skies. And now, we''ll meet them on the Parcheesi boards!

  Democracy must be saved. We must destroy them before they destroy us.

  And for those who threaten peace, this means war!

  (THE "HOT-LINE" RINGS)

  .ch ex

  (ANSWERING IT)  Hello.  You want subs?  What kind?

  Trident?  Poseidon?  Pepperoni, peanut butter, double bananas,

  .ad

  (HE HANGS UP.)

  .ch kc

  (TO DEGREE)  You have an interesting way of running a war, Harry.

  Can we get back to business, now?

  .ch gd

  Why don''t you run along to my office and slip into something

  more comfortable.

  .ch kc

  I was talking about the war, Harry.

  It''s time to order the attack on the Fassablanca toy company.

  .ch ex

  Do you think we should sound a red alert, sir?

  .ch gd

  Exxon, sound a red alert.

  (IN CALIFORNIA HIP) Like yeah General?

  .ch gd

  I''m placing you in charge of the 13th army.

  .ch su

  Like general, my astrological charts and biorhythm index combine with

  like my meditation seminar leader and gestalt therapist, man, and like I''m

  not into superstition but could I have the 14th instead of the 13th?

  .ch gd

  When I want your opinion, I''LL GIVE IT.

  .ch su

  That''s cool, mon general.

  .ch ex

  Cool?  Would you like me to turn up the heat, sir?

  .ch gd

  No, Exxon. For God''s sake, Sunoco, why can''t you just take orders

  like everyone else.

  .ch su

  You want that with a side order of fries, Dad?

  (TAKES OUT A PEN AND PAD, READY TO TAKE ORDERS).

  .ch gd

  (POINTS PADDINGTON AT EXXON) I can''t let you do it, Exxon.

  .ch gd

  What the devil is going on here?

  .ch cp

  I can''t let you bomb the Fassablanca toy company.

  I love that company. They make wonderful dolls...

  Albert Ayatollah, comes with 52 hostages, but he''ll only acknowledge

  48... Anna Adultress, comes with her own stones and pebbles...

  .ch gd

  Enough! You realize this is treason, Corporal.

  .ch cp

  This is something bigger than both of us, General -- down at the

  toy company they have a Paddington 12 feet high.

  .ch kc

  Oh you darling, misunderstood baby.

  Let me put you out of your misery.

  .ad

  (SHE PICKS UP THE PADDINGTON AND ATTACHES IT TO PUNISHMENT''S NECK.

  Sunoco!  I want a report from all outposts.

  I want to know every movement the enemy makes.

  .ch su

  How does that go again, General? Out the vom, down the hall...

  .ch gd

  Not those kind of movements!  Troop movements.

  We don''t want to be caught with our pants down.

  .ch su

  Right! I''ll get the scoop on their movements.

  (PICKS UP PHONE TO GET INFORMATION, INAUDIBLY)

  .ch gd

  Now that every thing seems to be under control, why don''t we just

  step into my office for a little drinkey-poo.

  .ch kc

  I have to powder my nose. Why don''t you go on ahead?

  If I''m not there in five minutes, start without me.

  .ch gd

  (NOTICES GRINCHLEY TAKING PICTURES) Grinkoff! Give me that camera!

  .ch gr

  Yes sir!

  .ch gd

  I bet you''re just a double agent for the enemy.

  .ch gr

  Oh no, sir, I...

  .ch gd

  I bet they sent you here to tap all our secret resources,

  to sap our precious bodily fluids...

  .ch gr

  No sir, not at all, I...

  Your kind just makes me sick.  Sunoco!

  .ch su

  Actually, Harry, this piece of dirt is completely harmless,

  (ENTHUSIASTICALLY) Yes sir!

  .ch gd

  Enough! This man is obviously too feeble minded to be a threat.

  Get out of here.

  Yes Grinchley, it''s time for you to toddle off.  You have a few more

  embassies to visit.

  .ch gr

  Really?

  One dozen eggs, one quart of milk, pick up the cat at the vet,

  (QUIZZICAL PAUSE) What does it mean, sir?

  .ch gd

  Code, Exxon. It''s a message from the Commander-in-Chief.

  You see, even with all the fancy new devices today, war is still

  the same. It all comes down to one essential weapon.
