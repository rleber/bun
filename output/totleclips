Observer four-zero-niner mission recapitulation.
Monitoring progress of designated target subject and 
companions from the Fallen Angel Hotel currently moving through
a black hole by means of
a Kerr-Newman-Kruskal Singularity Rotational Isolator and
Horizon Tunnel Magnification Device. Last port of call was
a close simulation of planet Earth, circa 1968
created by a human named Ambrose as a preservation of the appearance of his
world before a global war destroyed most of the planet's surface.
A young female
named Paula stole the purses of the females Wanda, Fisher and Carnifoffle, resulting
in a temporary loss of the reality transfer mechanism.
Following the recovery of the purses from the man
Ambrose, the party successfully departed by means of the reality transfer
machine. Observer four-zero-niner continuing to record
for direct transmission to our Mistress, her eyes only.
Out.

It's freezing!

I must say the wind is exceedingly bitter even through my fur.

Will somebody close that window before we all freeze our butts off?
.sf WINDOW~CLOSING
.sw
Geez, I'm sorry we found that window at all.
.cf
We're lucky we found it, the way the stupid Ontario Liquor Laws make you board pub windows up.  I've been coming to the Fallen
Angel for years and I never even knew it
.ul
had
windows till Basil found this one.  And even it's frosted over.
.sw
So now we got a window we can't see out of unless we open it up
and pretend we're brass monkeys.  Big deal.
.pf
Streetwise, it is a big deal.
Now we can look outside to see if we're in any danger.
.sw
If we're in any danger, it's because we're so stupid we
go outside looking for it.  For once, just once, let's stay inside where we'll
be safe until we get zlapped somewhere else.
.ba
Really, Streetwise, have you no curiosity at all about what's outside that
door?
.sw
Nope.
.ba
What is the younger generation coming to?
.sw
I'm avoiding coming to a conclusion.
.wa
I had a client once who did that...rest his soul.
.cf
I don't see that there's any harm in looking out a window just to
check where we are.
.sw
Well, what did you see?
.pf
Not much -- it was too dark.
.wa
And too cold.
.pf
One thing I'm sure of though, we're not on earth.  Far too many
stars in the sky, and not a single recognizable constellation.
.ba
One other thing -- the odour of the air is so refreshing, if
there are any inhabitants on this planet at all, they have 
not yet developed a technology of fossil fuels.
.sw
Huh?
.cf
He means there's no pollution in the air.
.sw
Great, we'll never have to worry about black lung disease.
What a terrific place, let's stay forever.
.wa
Ooh, the cold's starting to get inside.  I hope the sun comes up soon.
.pf
Well, Wanda, that's not something you should really count on.
.wa
Why not?  It has to come up sooner or later.
.pf
Not really.  Planets rotate at different speeds; we know that
in our own solar system.  Even on earth the nights last six
months at the poles.
.wa
You mean it could stay this cold for six months?
.cf
With no heat in this bar, we'll all be icicles in half that time.
.pf
Six months, six hours, anything's possible.
.ba
I might point out that it appears to be getting brighter even now.

The mutt's right; look at the window!

Hey, I've been up for a lot of sunrises, and it doesn't happen that fast!

Observer four zero niner report continues.  Open window of Fallen

in any direction.  Small blue-white sun on the horizon.
Glint of metal short distance from bar.
.wa
That means the planet is going fast?
.pf
It's rotating at an enormous rate.
.wa
So the days are going to be pretty short, right Professor?
.pf
That's right.  How short, I don't really know; judging by the rate at which the sun came up, I'd say
no more than five hours from sunrise to sunset....maybe a lot less.  If we're
going to do any exploring, we'd better hurry.
.sw
Exploring?  Are you out of your mind?
.cf
Streetwise, quit being such a paranoid little jerk.  There's
nothing but red sand as far as the eye can see.  Nothing's
going to jump the professor if she wants to poke about a little
for scientific curiosity.
.ba
To be quite honest, I fail to see anything worth investigating at all.
What are you on about, Leonard?
.wa
He's pointing at something.
.ba
Ah yes, I see it now.  Some sort of metal structure protruding
from the sand.
.wa
Sure is shiny.  I wonder what it is.
.pf
I think we should go take a look.We've got at least an hour
before the black hole takes the bar somewhere else, so there's plenty of time to get there and back again.
.ba
It likely won't do any harm to spend a few minutes investigating.
.sw
I give up.  If you don't know by now that nosing around means trouble,
I'd just be wasting my breath telling you.
Me, I'm staying right here and getting some sleep.
.cf
Streetwise has a point, people.  We look like we could all use some shut-eye
after everything we've been through.  All except Leonard, that is...honestly, I don't know where
he gets his energy.
.wa
Neither do I, but I'm glad he's got it.
He's everything a girl dreams of.
.pf
We'll get some sleep as soon as we have a look at what that thing is.
.ba
I believe I will accompany you, professor.  I for one am interested in
learning from these new worlds we visit, not hiding from them.

Good.  We won't be long, people.  Bye.

Wanda honey, you want the cot in the back room?  I'm used to sleeping on a board, and the nearest thing I can find is the bar.
.wa
No thanks, I've tried that cot a couple of times, and I never get any sleep there.
.sw
Well, if you two don't want it, I'll take it;  I could use
something soft under me.

Funny, it was because of talk like that that I couldn't sleep.

Goodnight, people.

Yep, pleasant dreams.
.wa
I hope so.  I'm afraid I'm going to have nightmares about
Xenothon, Valuria, and all the rest.  You know, I wish
we could come out on top just once, show the universe that we're important too, and that it can't just
toss us around from one mess to another.
.cf
Yeah, we haven't made much of a showing so far, have we?
.wa
At least you can defend yourself.  I
wind up being the helpless victim all the time.
It's almost as if the whole universe was out to get me...
Ahh, I need some sleep, I'm sounding as paranoid as Streetwise.

They must have been activated when we entered.

It's a wonder
they weren't damaged in the crash.
.ba
You think this ship crashed here?
.pf
Crashed, abandonned, who knows?  Who even knows
what kind of creatures built this ship?
.ba
From the design of the 
chairs and other furnishings, I would say the ship was built by humans.
.pf
Humanoids at least...but not likely earth humans.
This craft is far in advance of anything
our technology could produce.
.ob
Female Fisher's analysis incorrect.
Comparison of ship's interior with record tapes reveals it to be of human origin, though of an era
considerably later than that of Fallen Angel Hotel.
.ba
The air smells so ancient...as if it had been closed up for thousands of years.
Professor, what's that you're leaning against?
.pf
It looks like a glass cube of some sort.
.ba
It seems to be glowing...as if it were alive.
.pf
Do you think it is?  Heaven knows what an alien life-form might look like.
.ba
It appears to be installed into the ship itself, by some sort of mechanical 
apparatus.  How odd...it appears to be a combination lock.
.pf
A combination
lock?  Tumblers and all?
.ba
Yes...Strange that a race so advanced should use
such a crude mechanical device.
.pf
Perhaps they were concerned that their power might break down, and so
they provided mechanical backups.

.pf
This may take a while to explain.
.ny
My people regard patience as a virtue.
.pf
Well, you see there's this singularity...
.ba
Professor, it does not seem likely that creatures who ride horses will
have the requisite knowledge to comprehend the complexities
of space-time singularities.
.ja
Huh?
.pf
Basil, it's worth a try.  You see Nyala, every now and then the singularity
sort of...well, gobbles us up.  Or rather, the bar.  Well, anyway, whatever's in
the bar when the singularity goes gets taken along for the ride, so to speak, and
we just happened to be there when it...
.ny
Enough!  You will tell all of this to the
War Council of my people.
.pf
War council?  There's a war on?
.ny
You will learn of it in time.
.ba
Professor, it is imperative that we do not
travel too far from the Fallen Angel.
.pf
Basil's right -- if we aren't back at the bar when the machine takes off, we'll be stranded here
forever.

Not so primitive as all that.  Did you know
they're telepathic?

Telepathic?

They weren't talking to us earlier, they were communicating by some sort of mind-link.  That's how they talk to 
each other, too.  The difference is that when they talk amongst themselves, we can't hear them.

I am glad to see you have recovered sufficiently
to answer our questions.

Wait a second, we want some answers too.
.ny
Very well, you may ask what you wish.  As I mentioned earlier, my people take great pride in their
patience.
.pf
Just what is this war of yours about?
.ny
It is a war, like any war.
From what little we may see in your minds, your species is as
familiar with the concept as is our own.
.ba
No self-respecting dog ever went to war.
.ny
Your species is scarcely less violent for that.
.ba
Me, violent?  Never!
.ny
Perhaps not.  But the predator instinct lives on in your subconscious
nonetheless.  It is that which is most easy for us to see in your mind,
the reason why Janos took it upon himself to subdue you so forcibly.
The veneer of civilization runs so thin in both of you, you will
forgive us in overlooking it at the time.
.pf
The veneer must be pretty thin in you too if you're at war.
.ny
Our war is one of self-preservation...we must fight to survive.
A brief history may
be in order.
You see, many years ago the spaceship you found in our desert was discovered by
a team of our scientists.  Inside was a device, a machine that was more
than a machine.  It...contains information.  A great deal of information.  In
fact, the accumulated knowledge of your species.
.pf
.ul
Our
species?  But earth didn't build that ship.  It's far beyond us.
.ny
There is no point in denying it; we found three-dimensional images
of members of your species throughout the ship.
.ba
Professor, perhaps the ship was built and launched some time after
our own era.  It was clearly designed for humans.
.pf
You mean the ship was, or will be, built in our future?
.ny
It is irrelevant.  The point is that the device
contains a tremendous of information,
which we thought would help us to develop our civilization more rapidly.
Unfortunately, there was a disagreement amongst our people as to the uses to which
the new knowledge would be put.  Even before the mechanism of the cube was understood,
a rift had developed within our state.  One faction felt that the technology
of your species would give us a chance to expand out into space, and make use
of resources available there.  They broke away, and set up a rebel state not far
from here.
.ba
And those who stayed behind?
.ny
We were the thinkers, the philosophers;
we chose contemplation as our way of life.  We sought the philosophical wisdom
that your species possessed, to create our own utopia.
.pf
And so the philosophers went to war with the scientists.
.ny
Yes.  The irony is that we had been dependent
upon each other for so long that survival became difficult.
We are slowly dying.  Our agriculture is too primitive to feed us,
our medicine too crude to heal the sick.  We need such knowledge from those who oppose us, and
with the power of the cube we will be able to seize it.
.ba
This is precisely the sort of meaningless struggle that humans have engaged in
throughout their history; what makes you think you can ever win?
.ny
Once we acquire the device in the ship and understand the principles by which
it operates, we will be in a position to destroy whatever opposition may exist.
.ba
But why haven't you made use of this knowledge device before?
.ny
Our former compatriots have until recently prevented us from approaching it.
However, a recent series of raids on their nearby encampments have cleared the
way for a full assault on their strongholds.  By dawn tomorrow, the entire plain
will be ours, including the ship and the device within.
.pf
Aren't you a little over-confident?
.ny
On the contrary, our confidence
is well-founded.  You see, in the last few hours we have gained some formidable
assistance.
.pf
I wouldn't call either of us formidable.
.ny
I was not referring to you.
.xe
Indeed not.  She was referring to me.

.ba
That's the priest who tried to kill Wanda in the pyramid!
What can he be doing here?
.xe
What I have done for centuries...serving my Dark Master.
.ba
But how did you get here?
.xe
Surely you didn't think that the Dark Lord would let his
chosen sacrifice escape him ?
She is somewhere on this desert of a world, and at sunset I will be free
to find her.

but alas with power comes weakness.  I cannot venture forth
in the brightness of day; but here day ends quickly, and the night will

Knowledge, knowledge that is rightly ours, but that is being kept from
