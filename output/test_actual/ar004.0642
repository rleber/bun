        their money to keep our planet going.  No one  knows
        the  size  of our reserves, so we've got to play our
        cards close to our chests. Think of what we  can  do
        for our planet with the money we make: modernize in-
        dustry, keep abreast of the latest  advances.  Thank
        God for the energy crisis!

TOROTHY:  Captain, I once read something back  home  in  our
        local  newspaper,  the Kansas City - Wichita Courier
        Bugle Post Dispatch World  Times  Sun  Weekly  -  in
        Slanderous  Ann's column.  It said that if you're in
        a falling elevator, you can jump up  and  down,  and
        that  way you get a 50-50 chance of being in the air
        when the thing crashes.  You see, if  you're  up  in
        the air when it hits the ground, you won't be hurt.


JERK:  That's great! Jock, do you think that  you  can  beam
        over an elevator big enough for all of us?
