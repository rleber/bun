ANNOUNCER:
And, now, live from Burbank, California, it's Time to
Tell the Truth or Consequences of the $128,000 Hollywood Celebrity
Joker's Password Concentration Gambit Dialing for Jeopardy--
"Name That Game"!
Here's the host of our show, JACK Pot: Calm on down, JACK!
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
JACK:
[Completely zonked out & with his back to the audience]
It's rilly wonderful to see you all here! [SHORT PAUSE. HE TURNS
AROUND]. Hey, just want to see if you're all awake. I've been up
for a week.
Of course, all of you regulars know the Rules of the Game, but
for the sake of the unfortunates who are tuning in for the first
time, I'll quickly review the premise of our little half-hour spectacle:
[Read very quickly, almost incoherently] Each contestant shall
pledge allegiance to the flag shipped by land or sea if you can
do reactor reveal the official secrets' acting inconspicuously
in the presence of mind over matter whether or not the words
make any sense-marked cards should not be bent, spindled or
mutilated beyond recognition of the reason it was going down to the
last cent in a self-addressed envelope.
And employees of the network and the production company and their
relatives, friends and casual aquaintances are prohibited by law.
Now, let's meet our only surviving contestant--give a big hand to
Mrs Brian Auga! [Mrs Auga's head is wrapped in bandages--she is a typical
housewife.]
APPLAUSE [Note: Carol holds up the APPLAUSE & BOOM cards, and does the DING!s]
What a suit, Mrs Auga, you're dressed to kill. Little lady, say something
to this adoring audience.
.sp
.ti -3

MRS AUGA:
Well....
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
JACK:
That's lots, Mrs Auga, don't waste it. What this plucky little
woman hasn't been through, wow! [pinching her cheek impersonally]
Can you tell our listeners what it was like in our opening round when
you made it through the Indian Rites of Manhood?
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
MRS A:
Well....
.ti -3
DING!
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
JACK:
Woh, time is really short today, Mrs Auga, but I hope you can share
your truly transplendid story with us some other time. Hey, give the girl
a chance and she'll take right over, the truest sign of a real champion.
And it sure seems like she's a champion, isn't she, folks?
.ti -3
[APPLAUSE]
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
JACK:
We're going to start the seventh round of the nine-round tournament
of champions right after this word from one of our sponsors.
.so fass/skit/ad.1
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
JACK:
And now back to our game.  Carol, why don't we tell Mrs. Auga what her winnings
to date are.
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
CAROL:
Well, Jack, she's brought the total up to $873,957.34--the Gross
National Product of Albania in 1965.
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
JACK:
That's the highest it's ever been. Mrs Auga, you get to choose
any word in the Engish language.
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
MRS A:
Well....
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
JACK:
Sorry, Mrs Auga, that wasn't the right word. You lose out on
our Prize of the Day--an autographed original copy of the Warren
Commission's Report--but you have a chance to quit now and walk away
with the cash that you've ammassed.
All you have to do is tell us whether this voice from your past
is coming from door number 1, door number 2 or door number 3.
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
MRS A:
What?
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
JACK:
That's close enough, Mrs Auga, but you still missed your chance.
Let's go on to our first round. Sheila, why don't you introduce
our celebrity guests, and give Mrs Auga a chance to catch her breath.
Woh.
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
CAROL:
From the popular movie, Return of the Revenge of the Son of
Star Jaws, Part II, Norman Sedan-Chair! [Bravado entrance.]
Beautiful co-hostess of the TV Gossip Column Variety Show, Private
Parts in Public Places, Sally de Bain, is also with us. [Ditto.]
Finally, our guest-host is the former musband of the ex-star of the
cancelled series, My Sister the WAC, talk-show personality,
Merv Eclectic.
.ti -3
[APPLAUSE]
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
JACK:
Now, Mrs Auga, our three stars are going to partake in a little
conversation. Listen carefully, because we're going to ask you a big
question when they're finished, and, as usual, you'll have to Name that Game.
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
MRS A:
Ok.
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
JACK:
Close up your ears, Mrs Auga. [She does.] [JACK talks through his hand:
]
The name of this game is "To Tell a Phony". Alright, Mrs Auga, that's enough.
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
MERV:
So, Sally, I hear your latest crusade has been to completely eliminate
poverty in the third world.
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
SALLY:
Yes, that's true, Merv. I don't usually like to talk about my concerns
for the betterment of the human condition, because it means a lot to me not
to brag about the things that are really close to my heart.
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
NORMAN:
Yes, Merv. I've known Sally personally for a number of years, and I
can state with complete confidence that Sally is the most modest person I know.
.ti -3
[APPLAUSE]
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
MERV:
Yes, and I'm sure all of us sympathize with and appreciate your kind
comment about Sally, because there isn't a single person in the television
business who doesn't acknowledge your integrity and honesty, Norman.
Your work for the Crippled Comedians Fund has been an inspiration to us all.
.ti -3
[APPLAUSE]
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
NORMAN:
Thank you, Merv. That means a lot to me, because I've always had a
great deal of respect for the way you manage to resolve sincerity with your
madcap public image. I think we can all learn a great deal from ability to
see the truth and have the courage to tell it to the world.
.ti -3
[APPLAUSE]
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
SALLY:
Did you really mean that, Merv?
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
MERV:
Of course I do, Sally. And I'm glad to have the privilege of being
in the presence of this truly great man.
.ti -3
[APPLAUSE]
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
SALLY:
Oh, please don't take offense at me, Merv, but
I doubt that a normative statement such as that can be made with
any degree of certitude.
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
MERV:
Well, Sally, I suppose that it was a rather sweeping generalisation
and so I sincerely regret having made it.
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
SALLY:
How do I know you really mean that?
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
NORMAN:
If you knew Merv as well I as did, there would be no question in your
mind. But I have to suggest that Merv is going to ruin his credibility
if he retracts the substance of his statement with the stylistic
form of the statement.
.ti -3
[APPLAUSE]
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
SALLY:
Well, I don't know if I go THAT far. 
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
MERV:
I think that Norman is quite right, and I would have to say that I
was being hasty by doubling back on myself there--and I regret
that.  I believe that I made too much of my ability to judge
others, and I sincerely believe that I must retract my
correction.  Now, I take this sort of moral question very 
seriously, and I'm very sorry if I caused any offense to anyone in
the viewing audience, or to either of you, Norman and Sally.  And
I really mean that.
So, I'd have to go along with Norman and say that I couldn't go
along with myself.
And I mean that most sincerely.
After all, I think, like most people, that I as a Christian would
have to say that I have a great deal of faith in my judgemental
abilities, and I wouldn't want to waste them.
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
SALLY:
Do you really mean that, Merv, or are you being insincere?
I mean, do you appreciate the importance of what you're saying?
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
MERV:
What?
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
SALLY:
I mean, deep down in the bottom of your heart, do you
really, sincerely believe that your judgemental abilities are important to you?
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
MERV:
Well, I guess you're right.  I was rather flattering myself there, and I
sincerely regret such an innuendo on my part.  And I really mean that.
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
NORMAN:
Does this mean that your first statement about your feelings for me
is no longer operative?  I thought we were friends.  We played the
Copa together!  Let's not throw out the baby with the bathwater!
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
SALLY:
Merv, I think we're both being unfair to Norman. I see now that
Norman is a truly sincere person, and that we should not take advantage
of this weakness of his. I realize that he is veritable saint, and that
we should be ashamed of ourselves for mistreating him.
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
MERV:
[Overwhelmed.] I am truly overwhelmed, Sally. It is rarely indeed
that one gets the opportunity to witness a conversion of this magnitude.
My heart is truly warmed at this. You were wrong, and you had the
courage, the conviction to say that you were wrong. I mean, you weren't
just wrong, you were WRONG. You didn't cover it up--you came right out
and said that you were wrong. Ladies and gentlemen: Sally de Bain, a
truly great individual!
.ti -3
[APPLAUSE]
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
NORMAN:
Wow! Did you really mean that, Merv?
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
MERV:
Oh, shut up!
.ti -3
DING!
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
JACK:
Alright, Mrs Auga, you've seen our celebrity guests talking for a
while, now. Can you tell us which of them was being sincere?
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
MRS A:
Gee, Jack. I don't know. I didn't think any of them was.
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
JACK:
Wow, folks! Isn't that great? Mrs Auga saw right through our
trick question! Let's have a big hand for this little lady!
.ti -3
[APPLAUSE]
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
JACK:
Now, Mrs Auga, before you can go on to the next round, you're
going to have to Name That Game, and you have ten seconds, starting
NOW!
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
MRS A:
[Excited.] Oh, um, uh, Sincerity Sweepstakes, no, um, Diving for
Dullards, uh, Talkshow Tedium. No, no, uh, To Tell a Phony.
.ti -3
DING!
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
JACK:
Hats off to you, Mrs Auga, you did it just in time! To Tell a Phony
is the right Name of the Game.
.ti -3
[APPLAUSE]
.sp
.ti -3

JACK:
Alright, before we go on to the next round, we'll break for a brief
commercialist message.
.so fass/skit/ad.2
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
JACK:
Well, Lisa, Mrs Auga has made quite a bundle so far. Can you tell us
where the jack pot stands?
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
CAROL:
It's up to $964,345.95. That's the price tag of a brand new
KC triple 3 light-weight bomber. Mrs Auga can quit now and be our
biggest winner to date if she can prove Goedel's Incompleteness Theorem
before the bell rings.
.sp
.ti -3

JACK:
Go to it, Mrs Auga!
.sp
.ti -3

MRS A:
Given that propositional calculus satisfies the earlier complete....
.ti -3
DING!
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
JACK:
Oh, oh. Too, bad, Mrs Auga. Looks like you'll have to go onto the
eighth round of Name That Game if you want to get your hands on that cash.
You've been pretty lucky so far, but you're coming up against a pretty
tough customer when you take on our surprise guest. Introduce him to
the audience for us, Getrude!
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
CAROL:
Ladies and Gentleman, Nobel Peace Prize winner and editor of
SCREW MAGAZINE, the ever-popular Johnny Platinum!
.ti -3
[APPLAUSE]
.sp
.ti -3

JACK:
It sure is great to see you again, Johnny.
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
JOHNNY:
It sure is great to be here, Jack.
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
JACK:
Johnny, I hear you're in town to do some work with the Summer
Stock Little Players by the Olde Towne Halle in a pro
duction of
old Bill Shakespeare's Macbeth before you take off on that silver
bird [Mimics an airplane lifting with his hands.] for Vegas with a
seven-day run at the Gold Dust Pavillion, isn't that right?
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
JOHNNY:
No, Jack, that's absolutely incorrect.
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
JACK:
Well, get on over there, you big guy, you, and get ready for
your part in Name That Game. [He does.] Now, Mrs Auga, cover your
ears again, so that you can't hear the name of this game. [Talks
through cupped hands.] The Name of this Game is Celebrity Suicide.
Alright, Mrs Auga, knock it off.
A little background here for you, Mrs Auga: We've just injected Johnny
with 240 milligrams of PCP, better known as Angel Dust. On cue, the
old trooper is breaking out in a cold sweat, stomach cramps and severe
fits of depression resulting in acute paranoia. Oh, oh, Mrs Auga,
he's got the gun out, and it looks like he's going to
bite the big one right here on our stage if you don't talk him out of it.
You've got forty seconds, Mrs Auga, go to it!
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
MRS A:
[Running to Johnny while screaming.] Don't do it, Johnny!
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
JOHNNY:
I've had it, this old runway's got me down. It's no earthly good
to me.
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
MRS A:
You don't know what you're saying, Johnny, give me that gun!
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
JOHNNY:
What have I got to live for, huh? Fame is a fickle perfume,
wafting in the white wind. Nobody care's about me. They just want
me for my wallet. I'm going to end it all.
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
MRS A:
Think of what you have, Johnny, millions of people want
just what you have--money, fame, whiter teeth.
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
JOHNNY:
It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing. [He lifts the gun
to his temple.]
.sp
.ti -3

MRS A:
You're not going to kill yourself and ruin my chances of winning
a lot of money, you lousy creep! [The struggle over the gun, and it
accidentally fires into Mrs Auga's abdomen.]
.ti -3
DING!
.sp
.ti -3

JACK:
And she gets the gun away from him just under the wire! What timing!
.ti -3
[APPLAUSE]
.sp
.ti -3

JACK:
Let's have a look at that belly, there. Oh, it's just a flesh
wound, you big sissy, you. Now, Mrs Auga, can you Name That Game in
ten seconds?
.sp
.ti -3

MRS A:
[In shock.] I'm dying.
.sp
.ti -3

JACK:
No, that's not it. Come on, you can do it.

MRS A:
Oh, Save Our Stars, no, uh, Hollywood Freakout, uh,Celebrity
Suicide...

and our special guest, Johnny Platinum, who's been put in restraints.

JACK:
We'll have Anita put some ozonol on that
scrape, folks, while we break for these words.
.so fass/skit/ad.3
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
JACK:
We're back again. We've taken Mrs Auga out to the Bombastic Nuclear
Power Station just twenty-five miles away. We've planted a bomb somewhere
near the reactor, where Mrs Auga is standing in a lead-lined suit.
She'll have just forty seconds to find it, unless she can Name That Game,
and then we'll tell her where it is so that she can defuse it.
Otherwise she'll be blown into itty bitty little bits no bigger than
your thumb. She'll also take a  good chunk of suburban LA with her too,
but that's all in the spirit of fun in Name That Game. Let's give her
a big hand to show that we have faith in her, gang.
.ti -3
[APPLAUSE]
.sp
.ti -3
.ul
JACK:
I'm sure she'll appreciate that. For the benefit of our studio
audience and the folks watching at home, the Name of this Game is  
[Through cupped hands.] Let's Make a Deal for Your Life.
We're going to start the clock on Mrs Auga right now, so let's
listen in and find out how she's doing in her atomic scavenger hunt.
Are you there, Mrs Auga? You have forty seconds to find that bomb.
.sp
.ti -3

MRS A:
[Pathetic voice.] I'm here.

Have you learned to stop worrying and love that bomb?

MRS A:
NOOOOO! Get me out of here! I don't wanna play no more!

Go on, now, don't be spoilsport. Give it a try. Time's running out,
you know.
.sp
.ti -3

MRS A:
No, stop it, stop the bomb!
.sp
.ti -3

JACK:
If you can just guess the name of this game, we'll tell you where 
that bomb is hidden and how to take the little sucker apart. You have
only twenty seconds left, now, you don't want to disappoint the audience,
do you?
