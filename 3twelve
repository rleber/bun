  right, where is everyone? Boy, you leave them alone for a week and they all skip
  out \non you. What a crew this is!\nMaybe I should just lock the doors and publish
  the blasted thing myself.\n\n(PHONE RINGS)\n\nPeople's Bilingual Daily Gazette,
  Brassiere speaking. What? Just\nhold it a minute and let me get this down. Okay,
  spell that. Z-I-M-...\nYeah, okay, I've got it. And what happened there? Nothing!?\nWell,
  what are you calling in about... oh, just the name change!\nWell why in heaven's
  name couldn't they call it something\neasier like Smith? Smithgenstein?\nAll right,
  we'll try to run some thing on it anyway.\nYeah, goodbye. All power to you, too.
  (HANGS UP)\nWhere is everyone? Matilda! Woundwort! You just can't get good help\nthese
  days.\n\n.wo\n(ENTERING)\nYesssss, masssster?\n\n.rb\nAh yes, Woundwort. Where is
  everyone? I get back and the office\nis empty.\n\n.wo\nJust putting the finishing
  touches on this week's edition. It'sss\na goodie.\n\n.rb\nWell, look, I can't stay
  here. There have been a few complications in this\noperation. I've got to get back
  to the palace now.\nThe Winkle has sent the members of the Satirize crew out to
  find the\none true page. If they succeed, then all the dissent that we have\nbeen
  sowing for the past few months will have gone to waste, and\nwe'll be no closer
  to taking over this planet than we were before.\n\n.wo\nThe massster is a massster
  of disssguisssesss.\nWhy does he not take the place of the Winkle and imprison the\nSatirize
  people if and when they return to the palace?\n\n.rb\nJust what I was thinking,
  Woundwort.\n\n.wo\nI had a hunch you would be.\n\n.rb\nBack to that old line again,
  eh? Poor taste, old boy. \n\n.wo\nYesss, masster.\n\n.rb\nWell, I have to get there
  and take the Winkle's place before any of\nthe party return. The Boobies are just
  outside the door, and I expect\nthey should be waking up any time now. Hold\nthem
  here while I get my disguise.\n\n.wo\nYesss, masster.\n\n.rb\nAnd do something about
  that lisp.\n\n.wo\nLissssp?\n\n.rb\nNever mind. Just keep the Boobies here until
  I get back. Now that Brassiere has them in his\ngrasp, he will not let them go.\n\n.wo\nTrussst
  me, massster, I will make ssure that they do not essscape.\n\n.rb\nCross your heart?\n\n(WOUNDWORT
  DOES SO IN THE APPROPRIATE MANNER)\n\nGood, I'm off.\n\n.wo\nYesss, masster.\n\n(BRASSIERE
  EXITS. WOUNDWORT GOES OFF STAGE AND DRAGS THE BOOBIES ON STAGE\nONE AT A TIME, PROPPING
  THEM UP AGAINST TWO DESKS THAT ARE ON THE STAGE.\nHE MUTTERS TO HIMSELF ALL THE
  TIME THAT HE DOES THIS, IN TYPICAL IGOR \nFASHION. WHEN THEY ARE BOTH ON STAGE,
  HE TRIES TO WAKE THEM UP WITH LITTLE\nPATS ON THE CHEEK. EITHER TYPE OF CHEEK -
  TAKE YOUR PICK. THEY START\nTO COME TO.)\n\n.pd\nWhere are we? What's happening?\n\n.pz\nOhhh,
  Brian turn off the lights and come back to -\n\n.pd\nWho is Brian?\n\n.wo\nI'm Woundwort.\n\n.pd\nSo?\n\n.wo\n(SNIVELLING
  A LITTLE AT THIS REBUKE)\nWelcome to the People's Bilingual Daily Gazette offices.
  You are our\nguests.\n\n.pd\nIs this one of Jerk's little jokes? Maybe he had the
  doctor\nfill me full of some sort of joy-juice?\nI bet you're really Jerk, but I'm
  so full of\nDexelexedrine, you look different. Vast improvement.\n\n.pz\nWhat are
  you talking about? Who are you talking to?\n\n.pd\nJerk. He's doped us up so that
  he can take advantage of us.\n\n.pz\nHow like a man.\n\n.pd\nIndeed. Well, it won't
  work, let me assure you. Boobies are\nnoted for the utmost of restraint, even \nwhen
  they're in their cups.\n\n.pz\nUnless it's already worked.\n\n.pd\nRight, unless
  it has already... oh boy. Pig. You didn't even let\nus have a part of it. Don't
  try to deny it. I can tell by that hump on \nyour back that you 've got one on your
  mind as well.\n\n.wo\nI do not underssstand what you are talking about ladiesss.
  Thiss isss\nthe People's Bilingual Daily Gazette.\n\n.pd\nWhich is?\n\n.wo\nA publisssher
  of pagesss.\n\n.pz\nBilingual and daily no doubt.\n\n.wo\nActually they only come
  out once a week, and entirely in low Munchkin, or as you would call it, English.\n\n.pd\nThen
  why do you call yourselves that?\n\n.wo\nWe liked the name.\n\n.pz\nWhat do you
  want from us?  Why are we all tied up like this?  Say are\nyou guys bondage... nahh.\n\n.wo\nWe
  want you for the same reason the Federation does.  We want your\nsilicon.\n\n.pd\nNow
  what on earth -\n\n.wo\nFed.  The name of the planet is Fed.\n\n.pd\nWhat on Fed
  would you people want with silicon?\nThe Pederasty needs it for their starships,
  but you... Pride,\ndo you know of any Fed starships?\n\n.pz\nNo Fed starships that
  I've heard of. Ped yes.\nKlingsons.  Romulans and their allies, the McLaughlin Planetarians.\nThe
  Jeffersons.  No Fed starships.\n\n.pd\nThere. You see?\n\n.wo\nWe do not want the
  silicon for power.  We want it for injections.\n\n(PRIZE TURNS TO PRIDE.  THEY LOOK
  AT EACH OTHER, AND RAISE THEIR\nEYEBROWS.)\n\n.pz\nInjections?\n\n.wo\nYes, in the
  soles of our feet.  We want to be the same size as the\nother humanoids of the galaxy.
  \ We want enough silicon to make \nevery munchkin on Fed seven foot five.\n\n.pd\nWhy
  seven foot five?\n\n.wo\nIt seemed like a nice round number.\n\n.pz\nHave you tried
  elevator shoes?\n\n.wo\nToo obvious.\n\n.pz\nI don't know what would be so subtle
  about feet that had a depth\nof a yard and a half.\n\n.wo\n(WHISPERING)\nI know
  that, but the others haven't thought of it yet.\nThe moment they fill up their feet
  with silicon, I'll sort of feel\nthat they've joined the club.\n\n.pd\nAs it were.\n\n(ENTER
  MATILDA. ON THE RUN.)\n\n.wm\nGet back, get back, oh you devils, auggh they're all
  over the\nfloor.\n\n.wo\nAllow me massster.\n\n(WOUNDWORT RUNS ABOUT THE FLOOR STANPING
  ON INVISIBLE CREATURES\nWHILE MATILDA DCOES THE SAME.  THEY SCREAM FROM TIME TO
  TIME \nTHINGS LIKE \"TAKE THAT, \" AND \"GET THAT ONE BEFORE HE GETS \nUNDER THE
  CHAIR,\" AND \"WHY DO THEY TORMENT ME?\"  PRIZE AND PRIDE TRY TO \nSEE WHAT IT IS
  THAT THEY'RE ATTACKING, AND LOOK ABOUT THE FLOOR\nUNEASILY.)\n\n.pd\nWhat is it?\n\n.wo\n(WHISPERING
  WHILE MATILDA BOUNCES MERRILY ABOUT STAMPING)\nWe're not quite sure. He said once
  that they were black\nand about ten inches high, but that's as far as he would go.\nWe
  help him when he sees them, to quiet him down.\n\n.pz\nWho is that?\n\n.wo\nWahlsten
  Matilda, our assistant editor.\n\n.pd\nBit of a psycho.\n\n.wo\nYou might say that.
  (SCREAMING IN BOTH THEIR EARS.)\nGot you, you little bandit.  AAAAIIIII!\n\n.wm\nThat's
  the last of them. Hoooo.  That was close.  Well, we're safe\nuntil they regroup.
  (NOTICES BOOBIES)  Who are they?\n\n.wo\nThey're Boobies.\n\n.wm\nWhat about them?\n\n.wo\nNo,
  they\n.ul\nare\nBoobies.\n\n.wm\nOh.  Oh, those Boobies.  The silicon girls.\n\n.pd\nHmmph.\n\n.wm\nSo
  Brassiere is back?\n\n.wo\nBack and gone again. It seems that\nthe people from the
  Satirize have landed on the planet and \nare looking for the true page. As a result
  he's off to the palace to\nimpersonate the Winkle and make sure that they never
  find out\nwe have the true page.\n\n.wm\nIf in fact we do.  No one knows what the
  true page looks like.\n\n.wo\nI thought you said that that was the true page back
  in the storeroom.\n\n.wm\nWell, he says he's the true page. But then, they all do,
  don't they?\nStill, we figured that we'd better not have him wandering about\namong
  the people when we are so close to starting the Revolution.\n\n.pd\nRevolution?\n\n.wm\nYes,
  revolution.  Where were these people in scene two?  \n\n.wo\nUnder the influence
  of a sssedative, massster.\n\n.wm\nAnother opiate of the masses.  All right you
  two, I'll explain \nonce more, just in case there's someone else who was out-\n(SIDEWAYS
  GLANCE AT AUDIENCE)\n-when this was explained the first time.  We have been formenting
  dissent\naround the land for some time, turning the munchkins against \nthe Winkle,
  promising them that they can be tall once again if\nthey follow our leader Robert
  Brasieree.\n\n.pd\nOnce again. You mean that they were tall once?\n\n.wm\nAt one
  time the average height of a munchkin was six foot \nthree and a half.\n\n.pz\nWhat
  happened?\n\n.wm\nA group of travelling players came by the planets to put on a
  \nshow.  Starvie Harvie and company, featuring the incomparable\nChiChi la Cheek.
  \ They hit every city in the country and so \naroused the populace that they fell
  to vice.  In time the\nplayers left and the people went back to the drab normal
  way of life.\nBut it stunted their growth permanently. It's a\ngood thing they didn't
  go blind as well.\n\n.wo\n(DROOLING)\nI went to every show.\n\n.pd\nSo it appears.\n\n.wm\nThe
  few of us who were out peddling pages in the streets during\nthe show were saved
  from this fate worse than death.\n\n.pz\nSomeone tell you to go peddle your pages?\n\n.wm\nI
  wouldn't say that it was worse than death.\n\n.wm\nYou wouldn't. Anyway, that's
  the reason that \nthe munchkins want to have silicon and that's the reason that
  we\ncan stir them up against the Winkle in these troubled\ntimes.\n\n\n.pd\nWhy?\n\n.wm\nBecause
  he's still tall.  He was busy performing his own\nact while the players-\n\n.wo\n-
  and the people -\n\n.wm\n- were performing theirs.  For a while they looked up to
  him\nbecause of his height -\n\n(WOUNDWORT LOOKS UP AT MATILDA)\n\nbut it wasn't
  too hard for the paper to turn respect into jealousy.\n\n.pd\nAnd now the people
  are ready to revolt.\n\n.wm\nYes, as soon as we tell them that the silicon is at
  hand we \nhave nothing to worry about.  We will be able to lead them on the\npalace
  any time we feel like it.  Hmmmmm...\n\n.wo\nYesss, massster?\n\n.wm\nYou say that
  Brassiere has gone to the palace to take the \nplace of the Winkle.\n\n.wo\nYesss,
  massster.\n\n.wm\nThat's interesting.  Suppose that the revolt came while Brassiere\nwas
  still disguised as the Winkle.  His disguises are always\nso foolproof that the
  revolting munchkins could never tell \nthat it wasn't the real Winkle.  Hmmmmmm.
  \ Woundwort, take the\nBoobies into the next room and get them ready to go to court.\n\n.wo\nHow,
  massster?\n\n.wm\nOh, freshen up their ropes or something. Don't bother me with\ndetails.
  And hurry. I'll be back in a second.\n\n.wo\nYesss, massster.\n\n(EXIT MATILDA.
  ENTER BRASSIERE)\n\n.rb\nYou're not going to believe this, but I almost forgot the
  boobies.\nI'm off!\n\n(EXEUNT BRASSIERE AND BOOBIES)\n\n.wo\nYessssss, massssster.\n\n(ENTER
  MATILDA)\n\n.wm\nWhere are the boobies?\n\n.wo\nYou're not going to believe this,
  but-\n\n.wm\nOh, in tnis show I'd believe anything. Get the true page; I feel a
  \nsoliliquy coming on.\nNow let me see. All I have to do\nis lead the munchkins
  against\nthe palace while Brassiere is still on the throne, and kill\nhim fast before
  he can prove that he isn't\nthe Winkle.  I'll be the leader of the revolution.\nI'll
  have the Boobies, I'll have the silicon, and the\nmunchkins will have no one else
  to choose as leader except\nme.  Leader!  Emperor!!  Dictator!!!  Yes!!!!  It's
  perfect!!!!!\n\n.je\n(CRASHING THROUGH THE DOOR WITH NURSE CHAPPEDLIPS UNDER HIS\nARM)
  \ Not so fast, Brassiere!\n\n.wm\nI'm not Brassiere. I'm Wahlsten  Matilda,\nhis
  assistant and usurper-elect.\n\n.je\nWell, whoever you are, I heard you say that
  you had the true page, \nand I'm here for it.\n\n.wm\nYou can't take him he's -

  JUMPS BACK.\nMATILDA WRENCHES THE PHASER FROM JERK'S HAND AND LEVELS IT ON \nHIM.
  \ SHE CRUSHES THE FLOOR WITH HER FOOT WITH FINALITY.)\n\n.wm\nIt seems the shoe
  is on the other foot now, Captain Jerk.\n\n.je\nYou know me?\n\n.wm\nDoesn't everyone?\nAhh,
  here's my true page.\n\n(ENTER PAGE, LOOKING SUSPICIOUSLY LIKE WOUNDWORT).\n\n.aa

  not your master; I'm your master.\n\n.aa PAGE\nYesss, massster.\n\n.je\nShifts his
  loyalties quickly.\n\n.wm\nYes, it's so hard getting good help these... enough of
  this.\nIt's time for you to die, Jerk.\n\n.je \n(SLYLY)\nIf I have to die, I suppose
  I have to.  But surely you\nwouldn't want me to go on an empty stomach.  I've been
  carrying this pizza\naround with me for hours now, just waiting for a good spot
  to eat it, and now -\n\n.wm\nI don't care about your greedy stomach. Don't you realize
  that there\nare people starving in Zim... Zim... oh, blast, what is that name?\nWell,
  who cares.  Give ne that pizza. I could\nuse something to eat now.\n\n.je\nNow,
  Nurse Chappedlips!!\n\n(SHE LEAPS OUT OF THE BOX INTO MATILDA'S FACE, WHILE JERK
  QUICKLY GRABS\nTHE PHASER FROM MATILDA.)\n\nOkay, Page, you're coming with me back
  to the palace pronto. I've\ngot to tell the Winkle that the plot is almost boiling
  over.  You keep him\nbusy 'till we're out of here, Nurse.\n\n.wm\nMnnnnn, MMMMMM,
  MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!\n\n.je\nFace it, Matilda, you're licked.  Come on, Page.\n\n.aa
