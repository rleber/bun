  hundred and twelve?\n\n115-AL(2):  We were gonna sink more, but that was our  legal\n

  slobs.\n\n122-MACK(2):   (SPYING MARK HOLDING HIS WHIP.) Ah ha!  A rat\n   molester!\n\n123-MARK(15):
  \ No! No! It's not true!\n\n124-BRITT(4):  Either that or he's really kinky.\n\n125-MARK(16):

  boy, I grieved to have\n   caused a butterfly to die before it became a caterpillar.\n
  \  But  my Master said to me, do not mourn, for the stain on\n   your shoe will
  come out.\n\n128-HOO(11):  I agree.  Good riddance.\n\n(FROM OFFSTAGE, \"ONE, TWO,

  any trouble...\n\n[S-6] (DINNER GONG)\n\n134-AL(5):  Oooh, that was Rank.\n\n135-HORNBLOWER(33):
