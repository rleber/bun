  the world's first  computer-\n   run  ship  and my secret formula is stored on these
  tapes\n   (HOLDS UP TAPE).\n\n40-PSEUDO(20):  I just love Engelbert Humperdink,

  \ you  nerd.   Besides, the ship is a perfectly con-\n   trolled environment and
  I'm sure I'll find the subjects I\n   need  for  the experiment.  All of these pleasure

  my bulge-backed bollard!\n   But,  there  is one slight problem.  As security officers\n
  \  for this voyage, Mallard has hired the  famous  Inspector\n   Cousteau, and his
  assistant Chou en Hoo.\n\n66-PSEUDO(31):  Why is that a problem?\n\n67-WHOM(31):
  \  Cousteau has been around for the past four of\n   my master plans.  I met up
  with him first at Cannes where\n   my  X-rated  flick  \"She  Rubbed  him the Wrong
  Way\" lost\n   first prize - he was disguised as the Chief Judge.\n\n68-PSEUDO(32):

  \ What happened there?\n\n71-WHOM(33):   It  was  my  intention  to  kidnap Angela
  von\n   Schus, the internationally  known  ice  maiden,  and  in-\n   troduce her
  to the pleasures of apres ski.\n\n72-PSEUDO(34):  He stopped you?\n\n73-WHOM(34):
  \  Yes.   He  disguised himself as a St. Bernard\n   and drugged my brandy.  After
  that, I moved to Tahiti  to\n   steal  Captain Cook's book.  But I was foiled again.
  \ His\n   disguise as the celebrated Lotta Nookie  fooled  me  com-\n   pletely.
  \ I tell you, Pseudomoto, this guy is a master of\n   disguise.\n\n74-PSEUDO(35):
  \ You mentioned  four  times.   What  was  the\n   fourth?\n\n75-WHOM(35):   The
  \ poker game on the Orient Express.  I had\n   this guy all set up for the sting
  and some  dude  started\n   to play a Joplin rag.\n\n76-PSEUDO(36):  Cousteau, again.
  \ Right?\n\n77-WHOM(36):  No, it was Marvin Hamlisch.  I lost my concen-\n   tration
  and ran out of there in a hurry.  A  good  thing,\n   too, I could have lost everything;
  that train was murder.\n\n78-PSEUDO(37):  What about Cousteau?\n\n79-WHOM(37):   Oh,
  \ yes him.  Turns out he was the guy I had\n   set up.  Called himself Hercules
  Parrot...  or  something\n   like that.  I never could get foreign names straight.\n\n(APPROACHING
