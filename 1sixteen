  1, Scene 16 - The Celebrated Beam Joke Scene\n\n(THE COMPANY STEPS OUT OF THE FARMHOUSE
  ONE BY ONE. DODO IS HOPPING\nUP AND DOWN)\n\n.je\nTell Dodo that he can stop now.\n\n.su\nHow
  do you feel, Captain.\n\n.je\nWith much dexterity.\n\n.hu\nThe hell you do! (DUSTS
  OFF HER BOOBS.)\n\n.je\nHere, let me help you with those.... I mean that.\n\n.ty\nThank
  heavens we all made it!\n\n.hu\nThe captain is still trying to make it.\n\n.to\n(ENTERS
  WITH PIZZA)\nKeptain, I'm afraid we have a casualty.  Look what I found \nin the
  washroom.\n\n.je\nEnsign! That's disgusting!\n\n.to\nNo it's not, it's Nurse Chappedlips.\n\n.je\nWell,
  tell her to take it back!\n\n.to\nNo, Keptain, it\n.ul\nis\nNurse Chappedlips.\n\n.hu\nIt
  looks more like a pizza.\n\n.je\nI always said she was a crusty old broad.\n\n.cl\nWho
  are you calling old?\n\n.hu\nWho said that?\n\n.cl\nI did.\n\n.je\nNurse Chappedlips?
  What does this mean?\n\n.cl\nI'm not dead!!!  I'm just depressed - but I'm getting
  better.\n\n.su\nYou don't look too peppy.\n\n.cl\nYou're no delight yourself.\n\n.su\nYou
  always were a saucy little tomato.\n\n.cl\nLook, I'm getting pretty cheesed off
  at you; quit cutting\nme up and get me a doctor.\n\n.je\nDoctor! I almost forgot.\n\n.to\nKeptain,
  Macintosh seems to have made off with the pizzas - \nI mean the Boobies.\n\n.je\nDrat!
  (WHIPS IT OUT.) Jock, are you there?\n\n.jo\nNo, I'm here.  What is it, Captain?\n\n.je\nJock,
  I - I don't know how to break this to you, but\nNurse Chappedlips is a pizza pie.\n\n.jo\nThat's
  rather tasteless, Captain.\n\n.je\nI wouldn't know, Jock. You're the one who hangs
  around with her.\n\n.jo\nI get the feeling you're trying to tell me something.\n\n.je\nNothing
  you don't know already, Jock.\n\n.ty\nCaptain Jerk, Captain Jerk! Look, off into
  the distance.\nIt looks like a short cloud of dust.\n\n.je\nDon't be silly, Torothy.
  \ Jock, analyse that phenomenon\noff in front of us.\n\n.jo\nCaptain, you're not
  going to believe this -\n\n.je\nIt's not a short cloud of dust?!\n\n.jo\nNo, Captain,
  it appears to be a cloud of short dust......\nand an extremely dangerous one at
  that!\n\n.je\nHow can you tell?\n\n.jo\nI've looked at that cloud from both sides
  now, from up and down, and\nstill somehow -\n\n.je\nI think I can guess the rest,
  Jock.\n\n.to\nHe's right, Keptain; I think we're in danger.\n\n.je\nHow can you
  tell?\n\n.to\n(OUT OF ACCENT) That sign over there says \"Welcome to Danger\".\n\n.hu\nWe'd
  better get out fast.\n\n.je\nHow can you tell?\n\n.hu\nThat cloud of dust is on
  the other side of the farm house.\n\n.je\nBut we're on the OTHER side of the farm
  house.\n\n.hu\nThat's why we'd better get out fast!\n\n.je\n(CONFUSED PAUSE) We'd
  better get out fast! Quick Jock, beam us aboard!\n\n\n.su\nWe can't, Captain. It's
  too dangerous!\n\n.je\n(SHAKESPEARIANISTICALLY) It's ... too dangerous HERE!\n\n\n.hu\nThey're
  getting closer, Captain.\n\n.je\nIf we stay here another second it's certain death.\nIf
  we try to use the transporter it's certain death.\n\n.ty\nIt's starting to rain!\n\n.je\nThat
  settles it! We use the transporter. Quick, Jock, beam us aboard!\n\n(A BOARD IS
  BEAMED TO THEM. BLACKOUT)\n\nfin\n"
