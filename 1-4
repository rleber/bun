  of the stolen plans.\n.ch ga\nAnd I found this. (HOLDS UP PIZZA BOX)\n.ch ca\n(SARCASTICALLY)
  Great! We go looking for thieves and bring back garbage.\nDid you find any fingerprints?\n.xx

  there?\n.ch al\nEighteen, Sir!\n.ch ca\nThen why did the guard let them out?\n.ch

  one of them gave me a nasty look, sir.\n.ch ca\nWhat did it matter if they had guns
  anyway?  You had guns too!\n.ch hp\nWe weren't carrying our guns, sir.\n.ch ca\nWhy
  not?\n.ch hp\nThey weren't loaded, sir.\n.ch ca\nWeren't loaded? Why weren't they
  loaded?\n.ch hp\n(RELUCTANTLY) Well, a loaded gun is dangerous.\n.ch ca\nYou're
  supposed to be dangerous. That's why you're guards.\n.ch hp\nOh, yeah, I hadn't
  thought of that.\nWell, anyway, we eventually got our guns and loaded them.\n.ch
  ca\nAnd then what did you do?\n.ch hp\nWe fired at the enemy, sir!\n.ch ca\nWhy
  didn't you arrest the thieves before they had copied the plans?\n.ch js\nIf we had
  stopped them before they took anything, it would only have\nbeen breaking and entering.\n.ch
  ca\nWhat of it?\n.ch js\nIf you stop a trespasser, they just shake your hand and
  give you a citation.\nBut if you catch a thief, they give you a raise. \n.ch ca\nBut,
  they got away!\n.ch js\nWell it was still a good plan.\n.ch ba\nThe general's coming!\n.ch
