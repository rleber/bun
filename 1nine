  IX''FASS'\nAct 1, Scene 9 - Sickbay Scene \n\n.mc\nTang, Tang, Tang!\nIs that all
  there is on this blasted ship?\nIs there no real food around here? (NOTICES GLASS)\nSay,
  a glass of apple juice, that's more in my line. Mmmmmm.\n\n.cl\n(ENTERING)\nOh,
  there you are, Doctor.\n\n.mc \nYes, Nurse Chappedlips?\n\n.cl\nThey're sending
  the Prize Booby up from the commisary;\napparently something she ate didn't agree
  with her.\n\n.mc\nSounds like the old Anita Bryant syndrome.\nAfter drinking too
  much Tang,\neveryone wants to take a powder.\n\n.cl\nOf course, Doctor.\nShall I
  get things in order for her?\n\n.mc\nNo that won't be necessary,\ncarry on with
  whatever you were doing.\n\n.cl\nYes, Doctor.\n(TURNS TO LEAVE.)\nBy the way,\nyou
  haven't seen a urine sample around, have you?\n(PAUSE)\nAre you all right, Doctor?\n\n.mc\nYes,
  fine, Nurse Chappedlips.\nCarry on.\n(SHE LEAVES.)\n\n(MCINTOSH RUNS OFF STAGE.)\n\n\n(ENTER
  JERK, JOCK, PRIZE, PRIDE)\n\n.je\nAll right, Bones, we're here.\nBones? Bones?\n\n(RE-ENTER
  MCINTOSH, WIPING HIS MOUTH OFF WITH THE BACK OF HIS SLEEVE.)\n\n.mc\nJust getting
  rid of some excess weight, Captain.\n\n.je\nAll right, but we've got a sick booby
  here.\nYou'd better see what you can do with her - she's sagging already.\n\n.mc\nIndeed.
  Where does it hurt, my dear?\n\n.jo\nMay I remind the doctor that no matter what
  the emergency,\nStar Flit demands that the proper protocol be respected in\nall
  dealings with Sick Bay.\n\n.mc\nOf course, Mr. Jock. A momentary slip on my part.\n(ASIDE)\nCurses
  - I must watch my step.\n(ALOUD)\nAll right then, my dear, there's just a bit of
  business to take care of\nbefore we have a look at your boobyship.\n(HE PRODUCES
  A BLUE SLIP)\nAll right, could you please fill this out.\n\n.je\nOh, she filled
  out long ago! (JERK DETECTS A FAUX PAS) Perhaps I should get back to the bridge,\nkeep
  a look out for any likely-looking ... uhh ... uhh ... you know.\n\n.jo\nA black
  hole would do in a pinch, sir; and you don't need to flush them.\n\n.je\nI'll tell
  you when we're pinched, Mr. Jock.\nI trust that you will stay to help our visitor
  with anything she needs.\nPride, would you like to accompany me to the bridge,\nperhaps
  by way of my quarters.\n\n(SHE SMILES, TAKES HIS ARM. EXIT JERK AND PRIDE)\n\n.jo\nNow,
  madam, let's see, what do we have here.\nName?\n\n.pz\nVantilla Esqimillara de Quentavo
  Francesca d'Anconia Ramalamadingdong Smith,\nPrize booby of the Realm.\n\n.jo\nIs
  that one 'e' or two?\n\n.pz\nTwo.\n\n.jo\nBirthplace?\n\n.pz\nMilwaukee.\n\n.jo\nCurrent
  Address?\n\n.pz\nVillage three hundred and sixty-four, East B 207, Boobaloo, Booby.\n\n.cl\n(ENTERING)\nBooooo-ballooooooooo!\n\n(SHE
  SMILES AT JOCK WHO FROWNS AND TURNS BACK TO THE QUESTIONAIRE)\n\n.jo\nOnto Arnez
  question. \n\n.pz\nDesi always talk in such an unclear fashion? Obscureness has
  its\nplace, but I love lucidity.\n\n(I'D JUST LIKE TO APOLOGIZE TO ALL CONCERNED
  FOR THAT LAST LINE.\nIT WAS QUITE UNCALLED FOR AND IN VERY POOR TASTE)\n\n.jo\nSign?\n\n.pz\nVirgo.\n\n.jo\nYou've
  never met the Captain before?\n\n.pz\nPardon?\n\n.jo\nNever mind. Dress size?\n\n.pz\n12.
  Mr Jock,  I really feel sick;\ncouldn't we do this after the doctor examines me?\n\n.jo\nSorry,
  but we have to do this by the book.\nWe can't start bending the rules, no matter
  how important a guest you are.\nProfession?\n\n.pz\nDeity and inspiration to my
  people.\n\n.jo\nHobbies?\n\n.pz\nHang-gliding, scuba diving, and collecting antique
  pizzas.\n(I STILL LIKE \"STUFFING RAISINS UP MY NOSE\")\n\n.jo\nMost memorable book?\n\n.pz\n\"Is
  There Life After Death?\" by Francisco Franco as told to Chevy Chase\n\n.jo\nLast
  accomplishment?\n\n.pz\nMaking it all the way to sick bay without losing any Tang.\n\n.jo\nQuote?\n\n.pz\nWhich
  is going to be all over your floor in a minute\nif you don't let the doctor do his
  thing; unquote.\n\n.jo\nScotch?\n\n.pz\nNo, Irish.\n\n.jo\nWell, that about wraps
  things up.\nDo you have an appointment with the Doctor,\nor would you like to see
  the nurse?\n\n.pz\nI don't have an appointment,\nand I don't need to see the nurse
  because the doctor is right there.\n\n.cl\nDon't you want to see me? (SNIFF)\n\n.pz\nWhy
  can't I see the Doctor?\n\n.cl\nPerhaps you need glasses.\nPoor dear, you should
  see a doctor.\n\n.pz\nThat's what I'm here for.\n\n.cl\nDo you have an appointment?\n\n.pz\nHe
  doesn't look busy right now.\nCan't I just see him now?\n\n.cl\nSnippish, isn't
  she?\n\n.mc\nWe'd better humour her.\nSet her up on the bed.\n\n.cl\nI'm sorry,
  Doctor, but the bed isn't working:\ndon't you remember?\nThe Captain cornered Lieutenant
  Huaryu on one of them last week,\nand blew out all the meters.\n[A CONCESSION TO
  THE HARD-WORKING PROPS PEOPLE.]\n\n.mc\nOh yes, of course, of course, you'd think
  that I would remember\nsomething like that.\nHow could it slip my mind?\nWell, we'll
  have to do it the old way.\nTell me, my dear how do you feel?\n(TRIES TO WRITE,
  SHAKES, WRITE, SHAKES, WRITES ETC)\n\n.pz\nDoctor, you're trying to write with a
  rectal thermometer!\n\n.mc\n(SHOCKED)\nWhat? Quick nurse, check the patient in bed
  3!\nSome asshole's got my pen!\n\n.cl\n(SHE CHECKS AND RETURNS)\nHere's the pen
  Doctor, but I'm afraid you'll have to wait for the cap.\n\n.mc\n(NIBBLES ON PEN)\nNow
  how do you feel?\n(REALIZES PEN IS IN HIS MOUTH, REMOVES IT QUICKLY)\n\n.pz\nMy
  stomach feels as if it's been run over with a tank.\n\n.mc\nThat's Tang.\n\n.jo\nLittle
  difference in the long run.\n\n.mc\nWell, I suppose I should make an examination.\nLet's
  see, turn your head and cough.\n\n.cl\nI don't think we use that test on women,
  Doctor.\n\n.mc\nJust testing you all. Say \"Ahhh\".\n\n.aa EVERYONE ELSE\nAhhh.\n\n.mc\nVery
  interesting. Extreme ventriloquosis.\nCross your legs.\n(SHE DOES. SHE IS STILL
  STANDING. MCINTOSH LOOKS AT HER POSITION FOR A SECOND)\nReminds me of the Captain.\n(HE
  PULLS OUT A RUBBER HAMMER AND TAPS HIS KNEE.)\nNo response to the reflex test.\n\n.pz\nIs
  that bad?\n\n.mc\nHow should I know? Have you been drinking?\n\n.pz\nOnly Tang.\n\n.mc\nAnd
  where does it hurt?\n\n.pz\nMy stomach.\n\n.mc\nHmmmm.\nNurse come here for a moment.\n\n(THEY
  TURN THEIR BACKS ON THE BOOBY AND WHISPER FOR A FEW MOMENTS.\n\nHike! My dear, we
  have decided that what is\nwrong with you is that you have a stomach ache.\n\n.pz\nAha!
  And what are you going to do about it.\n\n.mc\nOh, give you a needle I expect.\nThe
  usual placebo, the opiate of the masses.\nMLM triple-T.\n\n.pz\nWhat does that stand
  for?\n\n.mc\nMarxist-Leninist-Mao-Tse-Tung-in-Cheek-Thought.\nWe tried crushing
  up Rolaids and injecting them,\nbut they clogged up the needle.\nAnd when we tried
  to inject Alka-Seltzer,\npeople complained about the fizzing that went right up
  their arm\nand occasionally blew off their shoulder.\nWe could give you an enema
  of the people, but that probably\nwouldn't be a wise move, what with no washrooms
  on this ship.\n\n(MACINTOSH AND CHAPPEDLIPS BOTH SHUDDER AND GIVE A LITTLE DANCE)\n\nAnd
  this way we can vaccinate you at the same time against the epidemic.\n\n.pz\nEpidemic!?\n\n.mc\nNothing
  too serious. There's just been an outbreak of Shane flu on\nboard these last few
  months.\nSo you'll be a lot happier with a shot of MLM triple-T.\n\n.pz\nIf you
  insist.\n\n.mc\nNurse Chappedlips, the needle please.\n\n.cl\n(PRODUCING A NEEDLE)\nHere,
  Doctor.\n\n.mc\nAll right, here you go now, you won't feel a thing\nif I remember
  how to do this right.\nThere, nothing to it.\n\n.pz\nWhat a rush!\n(PAUSE)\nAll
  power to the pancreas!\n\n.mc\nThere, that will wear off in a few minutes and she'll
  be right as rain.\nBetter keep her here for a while, Mr. Jock,\nshe might be tempted
  to start passing out gastro-intestinal tracts.\n\n.jo\nFine, doctor, I shall proceed
  to the bridge and \nhelp the captain with his search.\n(EXIT JOCK)\n\n.mc\nPointy-eared
  creep.\n\n.cl\nHow can you say that, Doctor, when you know I'm stuck on him?\n\n.mc\nThat's
  only because his Vulcan skin has the consistancy of flypaper.\nWell, that's all,
  Nurse Chappedlips.\nWhy don't you go and do a lobotomy or something.\n\n.cl\nYes,
  Doctor.\n(AS SHE GOES SHE LOOKS AT HIM STRANGELY. TO HERSELF SHE SAYS:)\nThat's
  odd. He knows that we've done all the lobotomies\nthat regulations permit us to
  do this month.\nWe've had to put off the Captain's sixty thousand light-year\noverhaul
  'till March.\n(EXIT NURSE)\n\n.mc\nThat's right Miss Booby, just go to sleep for
  a while now, sleep tight.\n\n.pz\nVictory to the duodenum. (SLEEPILY)\n\n.mc\nThat's
  right, lull yourself to sleep.\n\n.in+5\n.nf\n**************************************\n***to
  the tune of \"Brahms' Lullaby\"***\n**************************************\nLiberation\nTo
  the proles\nUncle Karl is watching ....\n.in8\n.fi\n\nThere, she's asleep.\nWell,
  I can keep on giving her shots to keep her out until I\nget in touch with the others.\n(HE
  PULLS OUT HIS STETHOSCOPE)\nOpen channel D please.\nKuryakin? Never heard of him!\nYes,
  yes, hello?  All right.\nI have one of the Boobies and I'll soon have the other.\nWhat
  do you mean you can't pick me up?\nYou didn't get a ship?\nWhat do you mean 10 kilos?\nThat's\n.ul\nSHIP,\nwith
  a \"P\", Woundwort!\nWell, don't worry about it, I'll figure some way to get down.\nAll
  power to you too......\n\n(LIGHTS FADE)\n\nfin\n"
