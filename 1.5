  is to say, we've got our experiments all mixed-\n   up and we can't tell what's
  what.  I know  one  of  these\n   contains the World's Greatest Aphrodisiac, but
  until I do\n   a computer analysis of  each  test-tube,   I  won't  know\n   which
  is the right one.\n\n76-PSEUDO(12):   I understand, Master. This program of yours\n
  \  will let the computer tell the difference.\n\n77-WHOM(15):  That's not the only
