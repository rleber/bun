  FROM CREW)\n\nBetter increase speed\nto Wat Ten.  (TO TOLSTOY)  Are you sure about
  this\nplace, Ensign?\n\n.to\nOh It says right here on the map, Captain.  Hershey's\nBar

  Pavlov.\n\n.to\nThat's Tolstoy, sir.\n\n.je\nWhatever -\n\n.pd\nWhy are you all
  so impatient to get to this \nplace?\n\n.je\nWell, you may find this hard to believe,
  but you see, when they\ndesigned this ship they neglected to include\nfacilities.\n\n.pz\nFacilities?\n\n.je\nThey
  forgot to plan a head.\n\n.pd\nHead?\n\n.je\n(GETTING EMBARASSED (YOU'D THINK HE
  WOULD)) You know, a can; a john.\n\n.pz\nCan?\n\n.pd\nJohn?\n\n.je\nThere's no reading

  thought it was\nit was Cannabis Majoris, Cannabis Majoris.\n\n.je\nSpot, what are
  you doing?\n\n.st\nDictating my report in duplicate, sir.\n\n.je\nComputer, are
  you recording this garbage?\n\n.aa COMPUTER~VOICE~(OFFSTAGE)\nYes sir, Yes sir.\n\n.je\nErase

  proceed to report.\n\n.st\nWell, sir - it was very rough on Canis Majoris.\nIt's
  a dog-eat-dog world down there.\n\n.to\nSpot, you're never satisfied - all you ever
  do is \nbitch, bitch, bitch!\n\n.st\nSo do the men on Canis Majoris.  Now quit hounding\nme.\n\n.je\nDid
  you manage to procure the supplies?\n\n.st\nBut procuring's illegal.\n\n.je\nSpotty
  - did you get our supplies or not?\n\n.st\nYes, sir!  I even got some extra stuff.\n\n.je\nExtra
  stuff - I'm afraid to ask!  What did you get?\n\n.st\nFresh seafood.\n\n.su\nCrabs

  Dilithium crystals on Canis Majoris?\n\n.st\nWell - uh-\n\n.je\nSpotty, why do you
  do it?\n\n.st\nI snort 'em cause I like 'em, and I'd rather fight than \ntwitch.
  \ I mean, Dilithium feels good like a \nhallucinogen should!\n\n.je\nThat's poor
  English.\n\n.st\nWhat do you want, good grammar or a good waste?  Me and \nmy dilithium
  got a real good thing - two good things \nin fact.  I'd walk a mile for a sample.\nRemember
  - you can snort when you're out of the country, but...\n\n(GONG!)\n\n(SPOT SHRUGS,
  STAYS SILENT)\n\n.to\nKyeptin, Kyeptin, I've picked up a UFO on my sensors!\n\n.je\nWho
