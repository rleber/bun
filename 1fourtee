  % -'FASS'\nAct I, Scene 14 - The Farm House\n\n(WE OPEN ON A LINE CONSISTING OF
  HUARU, SURU, CHAPPEDLIPS\nAND TOLSTOY IN FRONT OF THE DOOR; ALL STAND\nIMPATIENTLY.
  \ MEANWHILE, BRASSIERE STANDS DISGRUNTLED,\nHOLDING A PHASER ON THE TWO BOOBIES
  TIED BACK TO BACK.\nTOROTHY AND DODO SIT ON THE STEPS, TOROTHY CONSOLING DODO.)\n\n.pz\nPride,
  look at the Satirize crew members.\n\n(THEY HOP AROUND A HALF TURN AFTER THIS AND
  FOLLOWING LINES OF\nTHEIR CONVERSATION SO THAT WHOEVER IS TALKING IS FACING THE
  CREW MEMBERS)\n\n.pd\nIt's incredible.  What can they be doing?\n\n(HALF TURN)\n\n.pz\nI
  would guess that it's some form of primitive\nworship, seeking the blessing of a
  god upon their\nefforts.\n\n(HALF TURN)\n\n.pd\nSo that's what Ensign Tolstoy meant
  about paying\na visit to the Great White Telephone.\n\n(HALF TURN)\n\n.pz\nTelephone
  worship?  What a bunch of dingalings.  (PAUSE)\nI suppose the Captain is waiting
  for some sort of sign\nbefore he comes out.\n\n(FLUSHING SOUND IS HEARD.  CAPTAIN
  COMES OUT OF THE HEAD,\nDOING UP HIS FLY.  DODO HOWLS. HUARU RUSHES IN, OTHERS GRIMACE.)\n\n.je\nAll
  right, whoever you are; we've done our share - that\nis, we've come over here to
  negotiate.  Now tell us what you\nwant for the Boobies' safety: make us a proposition.\n\n.br\nReally,
  Captain, I'm flattered, but you're really not\nmy type.  Now Nurse Chappedlips...\n\n.je\nNurse,
  come here.\n\n.cl\nI can't.\n\n.je \nYou what?\n\n.cl\nI said I can't! I'l lose
  my place in line!\n\n.je\nNurse Chappedlips, the lives of two people are at stake,\nnot
  to mention the energy reserves of the entire\nPederasty.  Now get over here!\n\n(CHAPPEDLIPS,
  POUTING, GOES OVER.)\n\n(TOLSTOY RUBS HIS HANDS WITH GLEE AND TAKES HER PLACE IN
  LINE.\nTOILET FLUSHES AND DODO HOWLS.  HUARU EXITS AND SURU\nGOES INSIDE.)\n\n.je\nTorothy,
  can't you control that animal of yours?\n\n.ty\nHe can't help it. He's in agony.\n\n.je\nAgony?
  What's the matter?  You didn't feed him some\nof those Tang biscuits back on the
  ship did you?\n\n.ty\nJust a few Captain; he was SO hungry.  And now he's got\nto
  go for a walk awful bad.\n\n.je\nWell, take him for one then.\n\n.hu\nCaptain, you
  can't be serious.  Here we are, high over\na strange planet in a two-storey farmhouse
  at an altitude\nof over thirty thousand miles!  And you're suggesting that\nTorothy
  put a leash on that dog-\n\n.ty\nOh, Dodo, doesn't need a leash.  He'sh shubletting.\n\n(FLUSH,
  HOWL. SURU LEAVES WASHROOM AND TOLSTOY TAKES HIS PLACE)\n\n.hu\nYou're suggesting
  that Torothy walk her dog out that front\ndoor and off into empty space?\n\n.ty\nActually,
  we've got a verandah.\n\n.hu\nBut Torothy, you don't understand, there's a vaccuum
  out there.\n\n.ty\nThere's one in here too.  We had a broom, but Miss Esquimillara\nde
  Quentavo Francesca d'Anconia Ramalamadingdong Smith\ndown the road borrowed it when
  she flew to Hawaii over the holidays.\n\n.pz\nSmartass kid.\n\n.hu\nNo, Torothy,
  what I mean is, there's no air out there.  If\nyou tried to walk out that door,
  you'd burst like a rubber...\nBalloon!\n\n.ty\nCaptain! How horrible.\n\n.je\nIt
  was just an idea. (SHRUGS)  I guess we can let him use the facilities.\nNurse!!!!\n\n(SHE
  HAS BEEN EDGING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE WASHROOM.\nSHE FREEZES.)  \n\nGet back
  here!!!!!!\n\n(SHE COMPLIES.  FLUSH, HOWL, TOLSTOY COMES OUT OF\nWASHROOM, TOROTHY
  AND DODO GO INSIDE, TOROTHY HOLDING\nDODO UP INTO A SUGGESTIVE POSITION.)\n\n.je\nNow,
  where were we, my bogus Bones?\n\n(COMMUNICATOR BLEEPS - JERK ANSWERS.)\n\n.je\nJerk
  here, what is it Spotty?\n\n.jo\nThis is Jock, Captain.\n\n.je\nAll right then,
  Jock.\n\n.st\nSpotty here sir, what did you want?\n\n.je\nJock!\n\n.st\nCarnally,
  sir?\n\n.je\nJust put him on!\n\n.st\nThe doctor's been doing that for weeks - he's
  convinced him\nthat the computer's going to have a baby.\n\n.je\n(GETTING ANNOYED)
  Spotty......\n\n.jo\nNo sir, this is Jock.\n\n.je\nWell?\n\n.jo\nI'm fine sir, but
  this isn't a social call.  I have\nsome good news and some bad news.  First the
  bad news:\nthe added weight of you and the crew members in that\nfarm house has
  proved a bit much for our tractor beams.\nI'm afraid you're breaking loose and falling
  to the planet\nbelow.\n\n.je\nBreaking loose!  Can't you do anything, Spotty?\n\n.st\nIt's
  no use,  Captain.  We can't hold you any longer!\n\n.je\nThey're not going to like
  this back at Star Flit Command when\nthey find out that we lost a planetful of silicon
  just\nbecause you couldn't keep a measley little split-level\nin orbit.\n\n.jo\nCorrection,
  Captain. The building you are currently\noccupying is a two-storey frame dwelling
  of early\ntwentieth century -\n\n.je\nSave it, Jock.  Just give me the good news.\n\n.jo\nWell
  sir,  apparently the spy sabotaged the transporter so that\nwe can't beam you off
  the farmhouse before it crashes into the\nplanet below, killing you all.\n\n.je\nThat's
  your good news?\n\n.jo\nNo,  that's YOUR good news.\n\n(TOROTHY AND DODO FLUSH THE
  TOILET, AND CHAPPEDLIPS HITS THE CAN.)\n\n.st\nCorrection Mr.Jock, we can use the
  transporter; the spy just destroyed\nthe ring modulator. As a result we COULD beam
  up the crew in bits an bytes.\n\n.je\nWell, that's a whole new ball game.  I don't
  suppose that you\ncould start with Dodo?\n\n(TOROTHY CRIES)\n\nJust joking, my dear.
  \ Well, what can we do?\n\n.ty\nCaptain, I once read something back home in our
  local\nnewspaper, the Kansas City - Wichita Courier Bugle Post\nDispatch World Times
  Sun Weekly - in Slanderous Ann's column.\nIt said that if you're in a falling elevator,
  you can jump up\nand down, and that way you get a 50-50 chance of being in the\nair
  when the thing crashes.  You see, if you're up in the\nair when it hits the ground,
  you won't be hurt.\n\n.je\nThat's great! Jock, do you think that you can beam over
  an elevator\nbig enough for all of us?\n\n.jo\nI believe the house will do admirably,
  sir.  I have calculated\nthe exact time of your crash, and so if you will \nsimply
  jump up and down as I direct you, I believe that\nyou will be all right.  Ready?\n\n.aa
  ALL\nReady!!!\n\n.jo\nUp, down, up, down, up, down, up, up, up, up.....\n\n.je\nFor
  Chrissakes give us a down!!!!!\n\n.jo\nDowndowndownup, down, up, down... (CONTINUES)\n\n.st\nFive
  seconds sir...4...3...2...1...\n\n.hu\nWhere's Nurse Chappedlips?!\n\n(WE SUDDENLY
  HEAR A FLUSHING SOUND FOLLOWED BY A TREMENDOUS\nCRASH.  BLACK OUT.)\n\nfin\n"
