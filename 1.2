  \ you.   Before we go any further,\n   I'd like to put an end to rumors of murders
  on board this\n   ship.   It's  true  that  last  year,  John's brother got\n   knifed\n\n(JOHN
  FALLS OVER WITH A KNIFE IN HIS BACK)\n\n   and there was that accident with Frank's
  \ cousin  on  the\n   archery range...\n\n(WE  HEAR  A  \"TWANG\"  AND  SEE FRANK
  STAND UP WITH AN ARROW\nTHROUGH HIS BACK AND FALL OVER)\n\n   and someone else...uh,
  let's see...I've forgotten...uh...\n   was it _\by_\bo_\bu_\br uncle?\n\n77-PURSER(3):
  \ No, no not my uncle!! I hardly knew him!!!\n\n(WHILE  HE  SAYS  THIS,  GROUCHO

  \ that  certainly  won't  happen  on  this\n   cruise.  Dave, why don't you tell
  the passengers a little\n   more about the ship?\n\n80-DAVE(5):   (TO  PASSENGERS)
  \ Perhaps everybody would like\n   to know a little more about the ship itself.
  \ Well,  it's\n   powered  by 94.5 engineers on a co-op work term, 105.7 on\n   cable.
  \ They keep us going at 50 watts.  Uh, knots.  When\n   they  all row in the same
  direction that is.  And to con-\n   trol it all, we have the latest, most advanced
  electronic\n   wonder  of  our  age,  a  cybernetic miracle using highly\n   sophisticated
  self-sustaining semiconductor circuitry and\n   a miraculous multi-mode mega-byte
  memory.\n\n81-HORNBLOWER(32):  A what?\n\n82-DAVE(6):   The  newest,  niftyest,
