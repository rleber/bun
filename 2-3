  questions about them.\n.ch ml\nRight.\n.ad\n(THEY LEAVE.\nIMA HAS FINALLY GOTTEN
  TIRED OF WAITING FOR STAN TO MAKE HIS CALL.)\n.ch iu\nExcuse me, but are you ever
  going to make a call?\n.ch ss\nWhat? (HE TURNS AND SEES THEM WAITING:) Oh, yes.
  I'll\nmake a call. Just as soon as I remember who I was calling and why.\n.ch sy\nMay
  we use the phone while you're trying to remember?\n.ch ss\nNo. You can't!\n.ch iu\nWhy
  not?\n.ch ss\nDo you know what I went through to get this phone booth?\n.ch sy\nAsk
  me if I care.\n.ch ss\nI don't care if you don't care. I've waited in line for hours,\nthen
  had to fight a lady for it, drag someone else out of it and\nwhen I finally got
  in, I'd lost my last dime.\n.ch iu\nLook, I'll lend you a dime if you let me make
  my call first.\n.ch ss\nThat's not the problem now. I already went and got more
  dimes.\n.ch sy\nThen what's the problem?\n.ch ss\nI told you already! I don't remember
  who I wanted\nto call or why! And after what I went through to get this booth, I'm\nnot
  leaving until I remember.\n.ch iu\nI don't think you realize the gravity of this
  situation.\nIt is absolutely imperative that I get in touch with Fassablanca!\n.ch
  ss\n(IMPRESSED:)\nWhat is it?\n.ch iu\nIt's a bunch of people who make toys and
  sell them for profit,\nbut that's not important now.\nThis requires personal action.\nI'm
  going to Fassablanca myself\nto try and stop the army before it's too late.\n.ld\n(SHE
  STRIKES A HEROIC PROFILE.\nUNFORTUNATELY, THAT PROFILE HAPPENS TO BE SVEN'S GROIN
  AND\nHE SINKS SLOWLY IN THE WEST AS THE LIGHTS FADE...)\n.es\n"
