  XV''FASS'\nAct III, Scene 15 - The Climax\n\n(IN THE WINKLE'S PALACE; THE WINKLE
  IS PRACTISING.)\n\n.wi\nBrassiere!!\n\n.rb\nWhere?\n\n.wi\nYou!\n\n.rb\nOh, yeah.\n\n.wi\nAnd
  I see you are not alone.\n\n.rb\nOf course not; you're here too.  Oh, you mean those
  two.\nI've been dragging them around for so long that\nI'd forgotten they were with
  me.  I suppose you're\nwondering why I'm here.\n\n.wi\nNot particularly.\n\n.rb\nOh?
  Well, I'll tell you anyway.  My bosom buddies have\ntold me that they're interested
  in magic.  And as long\nas I'm keeping them hostage, I figured I might as\nwell
  keep them amused too, so I came here.\n\n.wi\nYou've come to the right place.\n\n(BEGINS
  FINGER ROUTINE.)\n\n.rb\nNo, what they really wanted to see was the handcuff and\nlampshade
  trick.\n\n.pd\nWe did?\n\n.pz\nHandcuffs?  So we were right about that bondage thing
  he's got.\n\n.wi\nDespite my encyclopaedic knowledge of the realm of\nprestidigitation,
  I must confess that I have never heard\nof the handcuff and lampshade illusion.
  \ Could you\nplease describe it?\n\n.rb\nWell. it's quite simple really.  We simply\nhandcuff
  you behind your back and place a lampshade on your\nhead.  Then without the slightest
  movement, you\nmysteriously extend your lifespan by thirty\nthousand years until
  the handcuffs rust into nothingness\nand the lampshade is shrunk by the elements
  into\na yarmukka.  \n\n.wi\nOh, you mean the lampshade and handcuffs illusion.  Trust\nan
  amateur to get the name wrong.\n\n.pd\nThen you've heard of it?\n\n.wi\nCertainly,
  my child.  My teacher, the great Fetacini,\nwas a pasta master of this trick.  He
  once performed it\nbefore the high council of Munchkins.\n\n.pd\nDid he  succeed?\n\n.wi\nI
  was thinking of checking up on him next October.  When\nshall we start?\n\n.rb\nNow!
  There's no time like the present.\n\n.wi\nVery well.  Your handcuffs or mine?\n\n.rb\nAllow
  me.\n\n(HE PUTS THE HANDCUFFS ON THE WINKLE AND THEN THE LAMPSHADE.\nTHERE IS A
  SILENCE OF ABOUT TWO SECONDS.)\n\n.pz\nThirty thousand years, eh?  I hope there's
  an intermission.\n\n.rb\nAnd now for my foolproof disguise.\n\n(PUTS ON BOFFER GLASSES
  AND THE WINKLE'S HAT.\nENTER TOROTHY, DODO, SURU, TOLSTOY, GABANDABALF FROM ALL\nENTRANCES.
  RB LOOKS ALL AROUND)\n\nSo you're back.\n\n.aa ALL\nYes and I've got the true page.
  \ (PAUSE)  No,\n.ul\nI've\ngot the true page.\n\n.rb\nWell, one of you is sure to
  have the true page.  I'll\nleaf through them in a minute.\n\n.su\nWhat about our
  ring modulator?\n\n.rb\nWhat about your ring modulator?\n\n.su\nDo we get it or
  not?\n\n.rb\nCertainly you get it!  Form a daisy chain.\n\n.ty\nOkay, but Dodo goes
  beside someone else.\n\n.rb\nNo, you don't understand!  Ring modulators run wild
  on\nFed, so we have to hold hands in a circle with our backs\nto the centre to create
  a Ring Modulator vortex which\nwill suck in a ring modulator.\n\n.pd\nI don't think
  ring modulators are the only things\nbeing sucked in.\n\n(THEY JOIN HANDS TO FORM
  A CIRCLE.)\n\n.rb\nNow I take this length of special conductive rope and\nwrap it
  around you securely to channel the lines of\ninductive force through the domain
  of curved topological\nspace...\n\n(HE WRAPS THEM UP IN THE ROPE, CLEARLY TAKING
  GREAT\nPLEASURE IN THE TASK.)\n\n.pd\nYou know there's something extraordinarily
  sporting about\nthese Pederasty people.\n\n.pz\nHandcuffs, tying us up, and now
  this.  What's\nnext?\n\n.to\nSay, there are the boobies!  What are they doing here?\n\n.ga\nThey
  look like they're trying to trap a little ring modulator.\n\n.to\nWe don't need
  a little one.  We need a full-size....\n\n(COMMUNICATOR BLEEPS.)\n\n.to\nYes, Satirize?
  \ Tolstoy here.\n\n.jo\nOh, wow, hey man, what are you doing in that little box?\n\n.to\nMr.Jock?\n\n.st\nDon't
  mind him, Tolstoy.  What we wanted to tell you was that\nLt.Huaryu has found a ring
  modulator and so you don't need to\nlook any further.\n\n.jo\nIs that you Tolstoy?
  \ Oh, man, how's it going, buddy?\n\n.to\nHuaru has found a ring modulator?  But
  we're with the\nWinkle now getting one from him.\n\n.st\nWell, however you get it,
  we've figured out a way to get it\nup.\n\n.to\nIs Yeoman Randy up there with you?\n\n.st\nWhy
  do you ask?\n\n.to \nNever mind.\n\n.jo\nOh, I get it; Spotty, you said -\n\n.st\nQuiet
  Jock.  Just be prepared.  We'll be picking up\nthe modulator in a few minutes.\n\n.to\nRight.
  \ Well, it appears that  we don't have to worry about \nthis anymore.  We can leave
  things up to Huaryu.\n\n.ty\nMy name is Torothy and this is my dog Dodo.\n\n.rb\nBe
  quiet you people, or you'll scare\naway her ring modulator too.  Shhh, she's coming.
  \ Now\ndon't say anything, or we'll lose the one that we've\ngot.\n\n(ENTER HUARYU,
  LEFTY AND PAGE)\n\n.aa ALL\nShhhhhhhhh.\n\n.hu\n(WHISPERING)\nWhat's happening?\n\n.rb\nThank
  God you haven't lost it yet!!!!\n\n.hu\n(OUT LOUD)\nAnd\n.ul\nthat\nhasn't been
  easy with the Captain around.\n\n.aa ALL\nShhhhhh!!!\n\n.hu\n(COWERING)\nWhat's
  the matter?\n\n.su\nWe're whispering so we don't scare away your ring modulator.\n\n.rb\nTell
  you what.  Just hold still and we'll tie it to you.  Lefty,\ndo you want to give
  her a hand.\n\n.le\nLast time I tried that she kicked me in the bicep.  Oh well,\nnothing
  ventured...\n\n(BRASSIERE TIES THEM UP WITH THE RING MODULATOR.\nSUDDENLY, A ROPE
  APPEARS FROM THE SKY.)\n\n.rb\nAt last we can talk.  What's this?  (GRABS NOTE\nTIED
  TO THE ROPE.)  Let's see.  \"Like wow, man,\nthis is...uhh...this is....uhhhh....I'm
  like supposed\nto write you a message about.... wow man, there's blue ink\ncoming
  out of the end of one of my fingers, wow, oh yeah,\nlike....\"   Mr.Tolstoy...\n\n.to\nRight.
  \ (COMMUNICATOR) Mr.Spot, could you explain the purpose\nof this rope and the message.\n\n.st\nI
  had Mr.Jock drop you a rope to tie the Ring Modulator\nto with a message to explain
  what it was for.\n\n.hu\nWe all know what a ring modulator's for.\n\n.ty\nI don't.\n\n.st\nNo,
  the rope.\n\n.ga\nWhat's it for?\n\n.st\nTo tie the ring modulator to!  And then
  we grab this\nend of the rope and pull it... oh dear.\n\n.jo\nOh, hey, man, I'm
  sorry...\n\n.st\nWe'll get back to you.\n\n.wi\nSomebody check the handcuffs; I
  think they're starting\nto rust.\n\n.ty\nWhat was that?\n\n.rb\nOh, didn't I tell
  you?  Lamps run free on Fed as well.\n\n.ty\nThat must really cut your hydro bills.\n\n(ENTER
  JERK WITH THE PAGE.)\n\n.pd\nOh, Captain, you're back!!\n\n.je\nWhat about my  back?\n(HE
  LOOKS.)\n\n.rb\n(IN MACINTOSH VOICE)\nHere, let's see.  Oh, that looks bad, Jim.
  \ Quick, \nstand up against this wall while I tie you to the operating\ntable.\n\n(JERK
  DOES.  HE IS TIED UP FACING THE WALL.)\n\n.je\nBoy, it's a good thing for me that
  you were here, Doctor\nMcIntosh.  McIntosh!\n\n.aa VORTEX~AND~PAGES\nMcIntosh!!!!\n\n.aa
  LEFTY~AND~HUARU\nMcIntosh!!!!\n\n.aa PRIZE~AND~PRIDE\n(MATTER OF FACTLY.)\nYes,

  of that.\n\n.aa VORTEX~AND~PAGES\n(WHISPER)\nBrassiere.\n\n.rb\nI heard that!!!\n\n.su\nIf
  you're Brassiere, where's the Winkle?\n\n.wi\nRight here!  Pretty snazzy trick,
  eh, Suru?\n\n.to\nQuick Winkle; it's a trap.\n\n.wi\nA trap!  I should have known
  when you got the name of that\ntrick wrong.\n\n.ga\nIllusion, Perry. Illusion.\n\n.je\nWhatever.\n\n.wi\nYou'd
  better be long gone Brassiere by the time that I rust off\nthese handcuffs.\n\n.rb\nI
  will be.  They're wood.\n\n.wi\nWood!  Wooden you know!  What a sap I've been.\n\n.rb\nYes
  and now I'm taking over the planet and nothing can stop me.\n\n(ENTER MUNCHKINS
  SINGING.)\n\n.aa MUNCHKINS\n.nf\n.in+5\nBrassiere we love you,\nCan't you see us
  wave?\nWe believe in silicon\nSo tell us that we're saved!\nBrassiere we're with

  A CUP OF HOT CHOCOLATE)\nNot so fast, Brassiere. Just hold it right there; I've\ngot
  you covered.\n\n.rb\nHot chocolate!!!\n\n.aa MATILDA\nYes!  And now I'm taking over
  the planet and nothing can\nstop me.  At last, power is mine!  Hahaha.  Drat, there
  doesn't\nseem to be any rope left.  Wait, what's this?\n\n(ROPE COMES DOWN FROM
  THE SHIP AGAIN.)\n\nPerfect.\n\n.aa WOUNDWORT\n(CROAKS AS MATILDA TIES UP BRASSIERE.)\n.nf\n.in+5\n\nEvery
  time I've looked at you\nI've not comprehended\nWhat your plans for power were,\nJust
  what you intended.\nGuess it doesn't matter\nNow you've been apprehended,\nTough
  luck, Brassiere,\nI hope I haven't offended.\n.in8\n.fi\n\n.rb\nAh, sit on it, Woundwort.\n(THE

  one of them too.  You'll go with the\nrest of them.\n\n.ga\nWell, in that case...\n\n.je\nYou
  can't do this and get away with it!  We are\nrepresentatives of the Pederasty!  You're
  inviting\nopen warfare.  The Pederasty will avenge our deaths.\n\n.aa ERIC~ONE\nShut
  your face, you snivelling little coward.  Your beloved\nPederasty can't even remember
  to put washrooms on a\nstarship - oh yes, we know. How do you expect them to\nfind
