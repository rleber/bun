:content: ! ".so fass/fasshole\n.he 'FASS'- % -'ACT III SCENE X'\n.FO 'ACT III SCENE
  X''FASS'\nAct 3, Scene 10 - The Schlocks\n\n.ty\nI don't like these woods, Dodo;
  we must have been walking for hours.\nWait, there's a sign. \"This way to the Schlocks.\"
  \nHmm. I wonder what a schlock is. It\ndoesn't sound too dangerous, and if it were,
  I'm sure the Winkle would have\ntold us about them. He seemed to know an awful lot
  about all the\ndangerous things that abound in these woods. (FAR AWAY WOLF \nHOWL.)
  \ Oh, did you hear that, Dodo?  Maybe we'd better go to\nthe schlocks and see if
  they can help us find the missing\npage.  I see a light up ahead.\n\n(LIGHTS COME
  UP ON AN OFFICE WITH PERSON SITTING IN CHAIR.  A\nSIGN AT THE SIDE SAYS \"PSYCH
  SCHLOCK\".  TOROTHY AND DODO\nENTER THE CIRCLE OF LIGHT.)\n\n.ty\nHello, hello?\n\n.aa
  PERSON\nAh yes, hello.  Oh you must be the one bringing the dog over\nfrom the laboratory.
  \ (RUNS OVER TO DODO, RINGS A\nBELL IN HIS EAR, AND FEELS HIS MOUTH.)  That's strange;\nhe
  should be salivating.  Are you sure this dog was trained?\nHe should react when
  I tinkle.\n\n.ty\nHe likely would, but he doesn't know anything about bells.\n\n.aa
  PERSON\nIsn't he the one who they trained over at the lab to\nsalivate when he heard
  a bell?\n\n.ty\nThat must be some other dog.  This is Dodo.\n\n.aa PERSON\nI thought
  they were extinct.  Oh well, what can I do for \nyou?\n\n.ty\nWell, you see the
  Winkle sent us out...\n\n.aa PERSON\nOh, you must be the people from the Canada
  Council,\nchecking us out on our research.  Well, why didn't \nyou say so in the
  first place?\n\n.ty\nWell, I -\n\n.aa PERSON\nYou see, what we are doing is starting
  from Lorenz'\nwork with imprinting ducklings and carrying on from\nthere.\n\n.ty\nMy
  cousin Elmo used to do that.\n\n.aa PERSON\nImprint ducklings, or carry on?\n\n.ty\nBoth.\n\n.aa
  PERSON\nYes, well.  You see, what Lorenz discouered was that ducklings\nwill respond
  to anything that they have around them at\none critical period of their development.
  \ If they don't\nhave a mother around, then they will become attracted\nto some
  other object, and think of it as their mother:\nan old shoe, a stuffed doll, the
  experimenter. They \nwill follow anything if they are caught at the right\ntime.
  \ And they will begin to think romantically of \nthat object.  After a while it
  makes for kind of \nmessy shoes if you've been careless leaving them \naround the
  laboratory, but the concept is FASS-inating.\n\n.ty\nSo?\n\n.aa PERSON\nWell, we've
  wondered what sort of thing that ducks\nwill draw the line at.  And we've been having
  \ntremendous results.\n\n.ty\nWhat sort of things have you been using as mother\nsubstitutes?\n\n.aa
  PERSON\nOld cowboy movies.\n\n.ty\nHuh?\n\n.aa PERSON\nOld cowboy movies.\n\n.ty\nThat's
  what I though you said.\n\n.aa PERSON\nIt's really quite simple.  We just set the
  ducklings\nin front of a closed circuit TV and let them watch the \naction. Also
  we have a control group that watches\nnothing but re-runs of Hazel.\nFor example,
  this duckling\n(PULLS TRIBBLES (LEMMINGS?) OUT OF THE DESK AND\nNAMES EACH ONE)
  was bred completely on one of my\nfavourite TV shows. We call him Bat, Bat Masterduck.\nThis
  is Wyatt Duck, here's Bret and Bart Maverduck,\nthis is Ronald Duck, with \nhis
  twenty Duck Team Borax, and this is Lareduck\nand this is...bother, he's not supposed
  to be here.\n\n.ty\nWho's that?\n\n.aa PERSON\nThis is one of the ducks that we
  bred to watch Perry Mason.\nPaul Drake.\nOh, and here's the pride of our collection.\n\n.ty\nWho's
  that?\n\n.aa PERSON\nThis is the duck we started off on watching the\nCisco Kid.
  \ Remember that old show?  This is\n.ul\nthe Cisco Duck!\n\n.ty\nBut I'm not really
  from the Canada Council.  I'm\nreally looking for the Winkle's lost page.\n\n.aa
  PERSON\nWhy didn't you say so?  Well, he's not here.  Why\ndon't you try over at
  Arts Schlock.  They have some\nsort of page over there.\n\n.ty\nThank you.\n\n(THEY
  LEAVE.  THE PERSON AT THE DESK SITS DOWN AGAIN,\nRINGS THE BELL, FEELS OWN MOUTH
  FOR SALIVA\nAND SHAKES HEAD.)\n\n(LIGHTS OUT.  LIGHTS UP AGAIN TO FIND TOROTHY AND
  \nDODO IN EXACTLY THE SAME SITUTAION EXCEPT THAT THE\nSIGN HAS BEEN CHANGED TO ARTS
  SCHLOCK.)\n\n.aa PERSON\nHi, there, can I help you?\n\n.ty\nYes the Winkle sent
  me out looking for his true\npage, and the person at the Psych Scholck told me \nthat
  you had a page here.\n\n.aa PERSON\nThat's right.  The Arts Rotarian.\n\n.ty\nHuh?\n\n.aa
  PERSON\nThe Arts Rotarian.  It tell all sorts of things about\nArts and the Rotary
  Club.  Kills two birds with one\nstone.\n\n.ty\nAll right, I'll take one.\n\n.aa
  PERSON\nGreat.  Before you go, I'd like to point out that one\nof the poems in it
  this week is mine.\nI could have it recited to you if you'd like.\n\n.ty\n(DUBIOUSLY)\nAll
  right.\n\n.aa PERSON\nHere goes.\n\n.aa PAGE1\n.nf\n.in+5\nAhem, To a Fish.\n\nOh,
  fish, lone fish left in your bowl,\nYou do not complain, you do not carp\nWhile
  outside the organ grinder plays\nWeird melodies for his own amusement.\nWhat good
  is sitting alone in your bowl?\nCome hear the music play.\nLife is a cabaret, old
  fish,\nLife is a cabaret.\n.fi\n.in8\n\n.aa PERSON\nHow do you like it? It's\nreal
  isn't it?\n\n.ty\nCan't argue with that.  Sorry, I must go, you know.\n\n.aa PERSON\nSay,
  are you a poet?\n\n(EXIT TOROTHY, PAGE AND DODO.  LIGHTS GO DOWN. LIGHTS COME\nUP)\n\n.ty\nWell,
  Dodo, it looks like we have the true page now,\nso we can go back to the Winkle.\n\n(ENTER
  PERSON)\n\n.aa PERSON\nNot so fast, sweetibuns.\n\n.ty\nWho are you?  What are you
  doing in the land of the \nSchlocks?\n\n.aa PERSON\nSorry, you've got that wrong
  too, kiddo.  This isn't\nthe land of the Schlocks, this is the land between\nthe
  Schlocks.  And it's called the swamp of I.S.\n\n.ty\nWhat does I.S. stand for?\n\n.aa
  PERSON\nWho knows?\nBut you're wrong thinking\nyou've got the true page.\nYou've
  got to go to all of the Schlocks,\nand even then you can't be sure that you've\ngot
  the true page.\n\n.ty\nYou mean that there are more Schlocks than just the\nArts
  Schlock interested in the page?\n\n.aa PERSON\nSometimes it doesn't seem that way,
  but it's true.\nLook, I got to go to my class now, but good luck anyway,\nhoney.
  \ Oh blast, I think I left my wicker at home.\n \n(LIGHTS DOWN. LIGHTS UP. SIGN
  SAYING \"FASS OFFICE\")\n\n.AA FASS~WRITERS\nYup, yup, yup, yup, yup.....\n\n(LIGHTS
  DOWN.  LIGHTS UP.  SIGN SAYING MATH SCHLOCK. \nTHE PERSON IS THERE INTERVIEWING
  A\nBOY .  ENTER TOROTHY.)\n\n.ty\nHello, hello.\n\n.aa PERSON\nYes, just a minute,
  I'll be with you in a second. Why\ndon't you just sit down on that chair there,
  and try\nto catch something terminal. (TO BOY)  All right,\nwhere was I?\n\n.aa
  BOY\nYou were explaining why you changed the name.\n\n.aa PERSON\nWell, it was so
  negative after all.  People were \nsaying nasty things about the professors, and
  that\njust wasn't right. So we changed it and called it\nProcal.  Doesn't that have
  a nice ring to it?\n\n.aa BOY\nI guess.  Can I just fill one out on Prof. Dirichlet\nnow?
  \ I've been aching to kick him in the drawers\never since I got into his class.\n\n.aa
  PERSON\nNow you see, that's the sort of attitude we don't want.\nLet's start.  I
  liked this professor because: (a) He was\nan interesting speaker. (b) He was an
  all-round \ngreat guy. (c) He\nshowed real concern for everyone in\nthe class. (d)
  He gave great hea-\n\n.aa BOY\nWait a second.  I hated the guy.  I want to tear
  \nhim to shreds.\nI don't like the course,\nI don't like the professor, I don't
  like the TA's,\nI don't even like the room that it's held in.  I \nwant to be able
  to tell all the kids in the faculty\nto avoid this stuff like the plague.\n\n.aa
  PERSON\nBut that would defeat the purpose of the Procal.\nLook, why don't we go
  on to some of the questions\nthat don't deal directly with the course itself.\nWhat
  mark did you get last year overall?\n\n.aa BOY\nA \"B\".\n\n.aa PERSON\nCongratulations.
  \ And how old are you?\n\n.aa BOY\nTwenty.\n\n.aa PERSON\n\nHow tall are you?\n\n.aa
  BOY\nAhh, five foot ten.  Say what-\n\n.aa PERSON\nAnd does your mother drink to
  excess?\n\n.aa BOY\nLook, I just came here to fill out a professor evaluation\nform,
  I didn't expect the Spanish Inquisition.\n\n(DEAD SILENCE.  THE THREE ON STAGE STAY
  FROZEN FOR A FULL\nFIVE SECONDS, LOOKING OUT STAGE LEFT. THE PERSON SHRUGS)\n\n.aa
  PERSON\nHmmm.  Well, I guess that's all then.  Do you want a \ncopy of last year's
  Procal?\n\n.aa BOY\nI guess so.\n\n.ty\nI'd like one too please.\n\n.aa PERSON\nOh,
  is that all you're here for?  All right, here it is.\n\n.aa PAGE2\n(BABBLES INCOHERENTLY)\n\n.aa
  GIRL\nYou might notice that it's completely incomprehensible.\nThat's one of the
  little drawbacks of the format that we\nchose, but that's really very minor.\nWould
  you like a game of Risk before you go?\n\n.ty\nThank you, but no; I don't take chances.\n\n(LIGHTS
  OUT.  LIGHTS UP.  TOROTHY IS STANDING IN FRONT\nOF A SIGN SAYING IGN SCHLOCK.  AUDIBLE
  ALL AROUND THE \nSTAGE ARE FARTING SOUNDS.)\n\n.ty\nIgn Schlock.  I wonder what
  Ign stands for.\n\n.aa PERSON\n(ENTERING)  It's short for Ignorant, and that's the
  sort\nof noise that we make.  (BLOWS ON ARM, MAKING A FARTING SOUND)\nMAKES THE
  FARTING SOUND.)\n\n.ty\nYou mean to tell me that all you do is sit around all\nday
  making ignorant noises?\n\n.aa PERSON\nIt's a living.\n\n.ty\nThat may be fine for
  academics, but how do you expect \nto get a job in the outside world if you ever
  leave\nthe schlock.\n\n.aa PERSON\nOh, there's a lot of call for ignorant noises
  in the\noutside world.  They tape-record us for whoopee cushions.\nWe make the static
  on the P.A. systems in bus stations.\nCar backfires.  Trains shunting.  Background
  vocals for\nRod Stewart.\n\n.ty\nI see.\n\n.aa PERSON\nIt's a good training program.\n\n(ENTER
  THE EIGHT ENGINEERS IN DRAG.  THEY ARE ALL INDULGING\nIN STRANGE SOUNDS AND POSES.)\n\nThese
  are the pride of Ign Schlock, the Ign Pages.  They are\nby far the most ingenious
  igneers that we have.\n\n.ty\nGood grief, it's a schlock wave.\n\n.aa PERSON\nPlease
  try to be civil with them.  It might just look mechanical to\nyou right now, but
  when the chemistry is right\nthey're positively electrifying.\n\n.ty\nI think they
  have designs on me.\n\n(ONE IS ATTEMPTING TO UNDRESS HER.)\n\nI don't suppose that
  you can let me have one.\n\n.aa PAGES\nMe - me - take me!\n\n.aa PERSON\nSure. Here's
  a copy.\nTake them all, for that matter.\n\n(TOROTHY TAKES THEM)\n.aa A~PAGE\nThere
  once was a man from Nantucket, whose-\n\n.ty\n(QUICKLY COVERING THE PAGE'S MOUTH)\nYes,
  if this is the true page I can see why the Winkle\nmight want it back.  I don't
  think that he'd like word to\nget out about the sort of things he gets a kick\nout
  of.\nNo, no, Dodo. Bad dog.\n\n(SHE KICKS THE DOG OVER AND IT FALLS ON ITS SIDE.
