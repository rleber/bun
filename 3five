  V''FASS'\nAct 3, Scene 5 - Bus Stop\n\n(HUARYU AND LEFTY STAND AT THE BUS STOP PLAYING\n\"PAPER,
  STONE, SCISSORS\". KAMIKAZE KLINGON STANDS TO ONE SIDE.\nFIRST DRAW: HUARYU HAS
  PAPER, LEFTY HAS SCISSORS)\n\n.hu\nScissors cut paper.\n\n(SECOND DRAW: HUARYU HAS
  STONE, LEFTY HAS PAPER)\n\nPaper wraps up stone.\n\nTHIRD DRAW: HUARYU HAS SCISSORS,
  LEFTY HAS STONE)\n\n.le\n(GESTURES A STONE, SCISSORS, THEN SMASHES FIST ON THE\nGROUND)\n\n(LEFTY
  MARKS A CROSS ON HUARYU'S SHOULDER AND IS ABOUT TO\nPUNCH HER WHEN WE HEAR A CAR
  APPROACH. LEFTY THUMBS IT,\nBUT IT DOES NOT STOP)\n.hu\nI'm beginning to get desperate,
  Lefty. You're sure \nthat this bus will take us somewhere that they have a page?\n\n(LEFTY
  NODS \"YES\")\n\nAre you sure someone didn't just put a bus stop sign\nhere to fool
  people?\n\n(LEFTY NODS \"YES\")\n\nAre you sure the bus system hasn't gone out of
  business?\n\n(LEFTY SCRATCHES HIS HAND. HE WAVES HIS HAND INDECISIVELY)\n\n(THE
  8 ENGINEERS IN DRAG ENTER)\n\n.aa ENG1\nThere's something funny about the way you\ndress
  that I can't quite put my finger on.\n\n.hu\nWhat - who are you?\n\n.aa ENG2\nWe're
  the Ignschlock Rape Patrol.\n\n\n(LEFTY SUDDENLY LEAPS IN FRONT OF HUARYU TO PROTECT
  HER)\n\n.aa ENG3\nOh, don't worry, Lefty. We're not like that anymore.\n\n.hu\nYou
  know them, Lefty?\n\n(LEFTY NODS \"YES!\")\n\n.aa ENG4\nSure, he was a igneer once.
  He enrolled in civil igneering, but\ndropped out 4 months later.\n\n.hu\nWhat happened?\n\n.aa
  ENG4\nWell, after 4 months of classes with guys like us, he realized\nthat there's
  no such thing as a civil igineer. So\nhe quit.\n\n.hu\n(SUSPICIOUS) Why was he trying
  to protect me from you?\n\n.aa ENG5\nOh, that.\n\n(LEFTY NODS \"YES, THAT!\")\n\nYou
  see, we first joined the rape patrol because it\nseemed like an excellent way to
  get in some raping in our\nspare time.\n\n.aa ENG6\nThen they explained to us that
  the actual purpose of the patrol\nwas to \n.ul\nprevent\nrapes.\n\n.aa ENG5\nAnd,
  being the gentlemen that we are-\n\n(LEFTY GIVES A BULLSHIT SIGN)\n\n-we decided
  to stay with the patrol.\n\n.hu\nI see. And you wear dresses so that rapists will
  think that\nyou're potential victims and try to attack you?\n\n.aa ENG7\nNo, we
  just like to wear dresses. Bye now!\n\n(THEY FILE OUT. HUARYU AND LEFTY WAVE. LEFTY
  GIVES THE FINGER)\n\n.hu\nBoy, I wish you could talk. It's such a bother carrying\non
  a conversation with a dumb person _ oops, no offense.\n\n(LEFTY DRUMS HIS FINGERS
  ON THE GROUND)\n\nWait, I've got an idea.\n\n(PAINTS MOUTH ON HIS HAND)\n\nThere,
  I'm not a communications officer for nothing.\n(PAUSE) Well, say something.\n\n(LEFTY
  MOTIONS HER TO COME CLOSER. HE THEN WHISPERS SOMETHING IN HER EAR,\nWHEREUPON SHE
  SLAPS HIM)\n\n.le\nIt was only an idea.\nLook, I'm sorry.  What more can I say?\n\n(HUARU
  SILENT, HUFFY.)\n\nIt's just that, well, I've never known a starship\ncommunications
  officer quite as nice as you.\nYou are nice, you know that?\n\n(SHE SOFTENS A BIT,
  BUT REMAINS SILENT.)\n\nIt's awfully lonely being an arm, especially with\nmy brother
  so far away. In fact, I'd almost give my hand to make\nyou see my way.\n\n.hu\nOh,
  all right, I forgive you.\n\n(LEFTY SHAKES)\n\nSay Lefty, this is your territory.
  \ How often do the buses\nrun?\n\n.le\nTwice.\n\n.hu\nTwice what?  Twice an hour?\n\n(LEFTY
  SHAKES NO)\n\nTwice a half-hour?\n\n(LEFTY SHAKES NO AGAIN.)\n\nTwice a -\n\n.le\nJust
  twice.  (GESTURES) Once going and once coming back.\n\n.hu\nOh, no.  Your Munchkin
  transit reminds me of Beerwurst\nCoach Lines except that\n.ul\nthey\ndon't always
  come back.\n\n.le\nReally?  Beerwurst always comes back on me.\n\n.hu\n(MAKES FACE.
  \ PAUSE.)  Say -- where's that ticking\nnoise coming from?\n\n(HUARU AND LEFTY  LOOK
  AROUND AND FINALLY NOTICE\nTHE KAMAKAZE KLINGON.\nIN HIS HAND IS A ROCK.\nTHE KAMIKAZE
  KLINGON TICKS THROUGHOUT THE SCENE.)\n\n.le\nOver here!  Look at this.  What could
  it be?\n\n.hu\nOh no!  The scarf!  The sword!\nIt can't be, but it is!   It's Franz,
  the Kamikaze\nKlingon, and look, he's got a rock.\n\n.le\nWhat's the matter, do
  you want one too?\n\n.hu\nYou don't understand, he's probably set to go\noff any
  second now!  We must do something.\n\n.le\nLet me handle this.  I think I've got
  a fair grasp\nof the situation. (TO KK)...\n\n.hu\nWhy are you here?\nJust standing
  there ticking won't do you any good.\n(THICK GERMAN ACCENT.)  Ve\nhaff vays of making
  you tock.\n\n.hu\nYou won't get any information out of him.  Our only\nhope is to
  get out of here as quickly as possible.\n\n.le\nAnd miss the bus?  Never.  Besides
  I've an idea.\nMove slowly away from him.  (THEY DO)  Now\nturn your face away,
  don't look at him.  Just pretend\nhe doesn't exist.\n\n(TICKING FADES, THEN DIES.)\n\n.hu\nLefty,
  it worked.  How did you know?  Did you apply\nyour four months of training as an
  igneer?\n\n.le\nDon't be silly!  All that taught me to do was build\nbridges.  No
  I simply employed an old aphorism that\nI learned in my younger days.\n\n.hu\nWhat
  was that?\n\n.le\n\"No watchee, no tickee.\"\n\n.hu\nOh, Lefty, you're so handy.\n\n.le\nA
  lot handier than you think.\n\n(HUARU KICKS HIM IN THE BICEP -- HE DOUBLES OVER.)\n\nfin\n"
