  \  Well, I was trying to get the cooking badge\n   but I spilled some of the grease
  \ on  the  stove  and  it\n   caught  fire. Then when I tried to put it out with
  a hose\n   it spread and gutted half a city block.\n\n16-FULL(5):  Oh, that's bad.\n\n17-HAMBURG(5):

  \  cooking badge I got a job offer from food services.\n\n24-SUIT(7):  Now that's
  bad.\n\n25-HAMBURG(9):   It  wouldn't  be  if you didn't have to eat\n   what you
  cook.\n\n26-JAPAN(4):  You know, I think  I  just  qualified  for  my\n   I've-Heard-This-Before

  sticks together.\n\n43-SUIT(9):  You can if one's a match.\n\n44-HAMBURG(17):  All
