  was\na close simulation of planet Earth, circa 1968\ncreated by a human named Ambrose
  as a preservation of the appearance of his\nworld before a global war destroyed
  most of the planet's surface.\nA young female\nnamed Paula stole the purses of the

  somebody close that window before we all freeze our butts off?\n.sf WINDOW~CLOSING\n.sw\nGeez,
  I'm sorry we found that window at all.\n.cf\nWe're lucky we found it, the way the
  stupid Ontario Liquor Laws make you board pub windows up.  I've been coming to the
  Fallen\nAngel for years and I never even knew it\n.ul\nhad\nwindows till Basil found
  this one.  And even it's frosted over.\n.sw\nSo now we got a window we can't see
  out of unless we open it up\nand pretend we're brass monkeys.  Big deal.\n.pf\nStreetwise,
  it is a big deal.\nNow we can look outside to see if we're in any danger.\n.sw\nIf
  we're in any danger, it's because we're so stupid we\ngo outside looking for it.
  \ For once, just once, let's stay inside where we'll\nbe safe until we get zlapped
  somewhere else.\n.ba\nReally, Streetwise, have you no curiosity at all about what's
  outside that\ndoor?\n.sw\nNope.\n.ba\nWhat is the younger generation coming to?\n.sw\nI'm
  avoiding coming to a conclusion.\n.wa\nI had a client once who did that...rest his
  soul.\n.cf\nI don't see that there's any harm in looking out a window just to\ncheck
  where we are.\n.sw\nWell, what did you see?\n.pf\nNot much -- it was too dark.\n.wa\nAnd
  too cold.\n.pf\nOne thing I'm sure of though, we're not on earth.  Far too many\nstars
  in the sky, and not a single recognizable constellation.\n.ba\nOne other thing --
  the odour of the air is so refreshing, if\nthere are any inhabitants on this planet
  at all, they have \nnot yet developed a technology of fossil fuels.\n.sw\nHuh?\n.cf\nHe
  means there's no pollution in the air.\n.sw\nGreat, we'll never have to worry about
  black lung disease.\nWhat a terrific place, let's stay forever.\n.wa\nOoh, the cold's
  starting to get inside.  I hope the sun comes up soon.\n.pf\nWell, Wanda, that's
  not something you should really count on.\n.wa\nWhy not?  It has to come up sooner
  or later.\n.pf\nNot really.  Planets rotate at different speeds; we know that\nin
  our own solar system.  Even on earth the nights last six\nmonths at the poles.\n.wa\nYou
  mean it could stay this cold for six months?\n.cf\nWith no heat in this bar, we'll
  all be icicles in half that time.\n.pf\nSix months, six hours, anything's possible.\n.ba\nI
  might point out that it appears to be getting brighter even now.\n.cf\nThe mutt's
  right; look at the window!\n.sw\nHey, I've been up for a lot of sunrises, and it
  doesn't happen that fast!\n.pf\nNot on earth.\n.sf WINDOW~RISING\n.pf\nThere, see
  on the horizon?  It\n.ul\nis\nthe sun!\n.ob\nObserver four zero niner report continues.
  \ Open window of Fallen\nAngel bar reveals stark red sand desert, no visible signs
  of life\nin any direction.  Small blue-white sun on the horizon.\nGlint of metal
  short distance from bar.\n.wa\nThat means the planet is going fast?\n.pf\nIt's rotating
  at an enormous rate.\n.wa\nSo the days are going to be pretty short, right Professor?\n.pf\nThat's
  right.  How short, I don't really know; judging by the rate at which the sun came
  up, I'd say\nno more than five hours from sunrise to sunset....maybe a lot less.
  \ If we're\ngoing to do any exploring, we'd better hurry.\n.sw\nExploring?  Are
  you out of your mind?\n.cf\nStreetwise, quit being such a paranoid little jerk.
  \ There's\nnothing but red sand as far as the eye can see.  Nothing's\ngoing to
  jump the professor if she wants to poke about a little\nfor scientific curiosity.\n.ba\nTo
  be quite honest, I fail to see anything worth investigating at all.\nWhat are you
  on about, Leonard?\n.wa\nHe's pointing at something.\n.ba\nAh yes, I see it now.
  \ Some sort of metal structure protruding\nfrom the sand.\n.wa\nSure is shiny.  I
  wonder what it is.\n.pf\nI think we should go take a look.We've got at least an
  hour\nbefore the black hole takes the bar somewhere else, so there's plenty of time
  to get there and back again.\n.ba\nIt likely won't do any harm to spend a few minutes
  investigating.\n.sw\nI give up.  If you don't know by now that nosing around means
  trouble,\nI'd just be wasting my breath telling you.\nMe, I'm staying right here
  and getting some sleep.\n.cf\nStreetwise has a point, people.  We look like we could
  all use some shut-eye\nafter everything we've been through.  All except Leonard,
  that is...honestly, I don't know where\nhe gets his energy.\n.wa\nNeither do I,
  but I'm glad he's got it.\nHe's everything a girl dreams of.\n.pf\nWe'll get some
  sleep as soon as we have a look at what that thing is.\n.ba\nI believe I will accompany
  you, professor.  I for one am interested in\nlearning from these new worlds we visit,
  not hiding from them.\n.pf\nGood.  We won't be long, people.  Bye.\n.sf DOOR~OPENING\n.sf

  honey, you want the cot in the back room?  I'm used to sleeping on a board, and
  the nearest thing I can find is the bar.\n.wa\nNo thanks, I've tried that cot a
  couple of times, and I never get any sleep there.\n.sw\nWell, if you two don't want
  it, I'll take it;  I could use\nsomething soft under me.\n.wa\nFunny, it was because

  \ I'm afraid I'm going to have nightmares about\nXenothon, Valuria, and all the
  rest.  You know, I wish\nwe could come out on top just once, show the universe that
  we're important too, and that it can't just\ntoss us around from one mess to another.\n.cf\nYeah,
  we haven't made much of a showing so far, have we?\n.wa\nAt least you can defend
  yourself.  I\nwind up being the helpless victim all the time.\nIt's almost as if
  the whole universe was out to get me...\nAhh, I need some sleep, I'm sounding as

  guess not.  Oh well, ladies first.\n.sf FEET~ON~METAL~RUNGS\n.pf\nI'll just get
  my flash...wait a second, the lights just came on.\n.ba\nThey must have been activated
  when we entered.\n.pf\nIt's a wonder\nthey weren't damaged in the crash.\n.ba\nYou
  think this ship crashed here?\n.pf\nCrashed, abandonned, who knows?  Who even knows\nwhat
  kind of creatures built this ship?\n.ba\nFrom the design of the \nchairs and other
  furnishings, I would say the ship was built by humans.\n.pf\nHumanoids at least...but
  not likely earth humans.\nThis craft is far in advance of anything\nour technology
  could produce.\n.ob\nFemale Fisher's analysis incorrect.\nComparison of ship's interior
  with record tapes reveals it to be of human origin, though of an era\nconsiderably
  later than that of Fallen Angel Hotel.\n.ba\nThe air smells so ancient...as if it
  had been closed up for thousands of years.\nProfessor, what's that you're leaning
  against?\n.pf\nIt looks like a glass cube of some sort.\n.ba\nIt seems to be glowing...as
  if it were alive.\n.pf\nDo you think it is?  Heaven knows what an alien life-form
  might look like.\n.ba\nIt appears to be installed into the ship itself, by some
  sort of mechanical \napparatus.  How odd...it appears to be a combination lock.\n.pf\nA
  combination\nlock?  Tumblers and all?\n.ba\nYes...Strange that a race so advanced
  should use\nsuch a crude mechanical device.\n.pf\nPerhaps they were concerned that
  their power might break down, and so\nthey provided mechanical backups.\n.sf VOICES~AND~HORSES'~HOOVES\n.ba\nWait

  to explain.\n.ny\nMy people regard patience as a virtue.\n.pf\nWell, you see there's
  this singularity...\n.ba\nProfessor, it does not seem likely that creatures who
  ride horses will\nhave the requisite knowledge to comprehend the complexities\nof
  space-time singularities.\n.ja\nHuh?\n.pf\nBasil, it's worth a try.  You see Nyala,
  every now and then the singularity\nsort of...well, gobbles us up.  Or rather, the

  as all that.  Did you know\nthey're telepathic?\n.ba\nTelepathic?\n.pf\nThey weren't
  talking to us earlier, they were communicating by some sort of mind-link.  That's
  how they talk to \neach other, too.  The difference is that when they talk amongst
  themselves, we can't hear them.\n.ba\nSelective; rather like different radio frequencies.\n.pf\nLook

  am glad to see you have recovered sufficiently\nto answer our questions.\n.pf\nWait
  a second, we want some answers too.\n.ny\nVery well, you may ask what you wish.
  \ As I mentioned earlier, my people take great pride in their\npatience.\n.pf\nJust
  what is this war of yours about?\n.ny\nIt is a war, like any war.\nFrom what little
  we may see in your minds, your species is as\nfamiliar with the concept as is our
  own.\n.ba\nNo self-respecting dog ever went to war.\n.ny\nYour species is scarcely
  less violent for that.\n.ba\nMe, violent?  Never!\n.ny\nPerhaps not.  But the predator
  instinct lives on in your subconscious\nnonetheless.  It is that which is most easy
  for us to see in your mind,\nthe reason why Janos took it upon himself to subdue
  you so forcibly.\nThe veneer of civilization runs so thin in both of you, you will\nforgive
  us in overlooking it at the time.\n.pf\nThe veneer must be pretty thin in you too
  if you're at war.\n.ny\nOur war is one of self-preservation...we must fight to survive.\nA
  brief history may\nbe in order.\nYou see, many years ago the spaceship you found
  in our desert was discovered by\na team of our scientists.  Inside was a device,
  a machine that was more\nthan a machine.  It...contains information.  A great deal
  of information.  In\nfact, the accumulated knowledge of your species.\n.pf\n.ul\nOur\nspecies?
  \ But earth didn't build that ship.  It's far beyond us.\n.ny\nThere is no point
  in denying it; we found three-dimensional images\nof members of your species throughout
  the ship.\n.ba\nProfessor, perhaps the ship was built and launched some time after\nour
  own era.  It was clearly designed for humans.\n.pf\nYou mean the ship was, or will
  be, built in our future?\n.ny\nIt is irrelevant.  The point is that the device\ncontains
  a tremendous of information,\nwhich we thought would help us to develop our civilization
  more rapidly.\nUnfortunately, there was a disagreement amongst our people as to
  the uses to which\nthe new knowledge would be put.  Even before the mechanism of
  the cube was understood,\na rift had developed within our state.  One faction felt
  that the technology\nof your species would give us a chance to expand out into space,
  and make use\nof resources available there.  They broke away, and set up a rebel
  state not far\nfrom here.\n.ba\nAnd those who stayed behind?\n.ny\nWe were the thinkers,
  the philosophers;\nwe chose contemplation as our way of life.  We sought the philosophical
  wisdom\nthat your species possessed, to create our own utopia.\n.pf\nAnd so the
  philosophers went to war with the scientists.\n.ny\nYes.  The irony is that we had
  been dependent\nupon each other for so long that survival became difficult.\nWe
  are slowly dying.  Our agriculture is too primitive to feed us,\nour medicine too
  crude to heal the sick.  We need such knowledge from those who oppose us, and\nwith
  the power of the cube we will be able to seize it.\n.ba\nThis is precisely the sort
  of meaningless struggle that humans have engaged in\nthroughout their history; what
  makes you think you can ever win?\n.ny\nOnce we acquire the device in the ship and
  understand the principles by which\nit operates, we will be in a position to destroy
  whatever opposition may exist.\n.ba\nBut why haven't you made use of this knowledge
  device before?\n.ny\nOur former compatriots have until recently prevented us from
  approaching it.\nHowever, a recent series of raids on their nearby encampments have
  cleared the\nway for a full assault on their strongholds.  By dawn tomorrow, the
  entire plain\nwill be ours, including the ship and the device within.\n.pf\nAren't
  you a little over-confident?\n.ny\nOn the contrary, our confidence\nis well-founded.
  \ You see, in the last few hours we have gained some formidable\nassistance.\n.pf\nI
  wouldn't call either of us formidable.\n.ny\nI was not referring to you.\n.xe\nIndeed
  not.  She was referring to me.\n.ba\nXenothon!\n.pf\nBasil, you know this man?\n.ba\nThat's

  I have done for centuries...serving my Dark Master.\n.ba\nBut how did you get here?\n.xe\nSurely
  you didn't think that the Dark Lord would let his\nchosen sacrifice escape him ?\nShe
  is somewhere on this desert of a world, and at sunset I will be free\nto find her.\n.pf\nSunset?\n.xe\nThe
  Dark One has chosen to give me tremendous power,\nbut alas with power comes weakness.
  \ I cannot venture forth\nin the brightness of day; but here day ends quickly, and
  the night will \nbe mine.\n.ny\nXenothon, it is time to prepare our armies for tonight's

  Nyala with her plans for war?  Surely you stand nothing\nto gain by it.\n.xe\nI
  had the choice of arriving in this underground city or the opposing one.\nI chose
  the closest to Wanda, and ingratiated myself to them in the\nhopes of persuading
  them to capture her.  Instead, I found you. \n.pf\nWhat are you going to do to us?\n.xe\nLeave

  a telepathic lizard city.\n.sf DOOR~SLIDING~OPEN~(LIKE~AN~ELEVATOR)\n.fz\nAhh, my
  guests.  I am Zarya, empress of this state.\nI trust you are comfortable.\n.wa\nJust
  dandy.  You always chain up your guests like poor Leonard there?\n.sf RATTLING~CHAINS\n.za\nWith
  one so strong\nwe could not take the chance.  Is he a mute?\n.wa\nYes.\n.za\nHow
  ironic...we can communicate with him, but you can't.\n.wa\nHey, he might not be
  able to talk, but when it comes to physical\ncommunication, Leonard is a pro.\n.za\nI
  do not understand your meaning...the images I see in your mind\nare puzzling.  To
  what form of communication are you referring?\n.cf\nWe call it sex.\n.za\nAhh...we
  call it mating.\n.wa\nNow that's what I call a philosophical difference.\n.ob\nObserver

  companions...they are apparently in a sealed room of a\nfortress approximately ten
  kilometers due west of Fallen Angel.  Continuing\nto record.\n.za\nHow odd...I suddenly
  sense the presence of another mind in the room.\n.wa\nLook, how long are you going
  to keep us here?\n.za\nUntil we decide what is to be done with you.\nWe are at war
  and must be certain who are friends and who are enemies.\n.cf\nYou're at war?\n.za\nWe
  have been for quite some time.  It would be over by now were it not for\nthe stubborness
  of our enemies.\n.cf\nThat's usually the way with wars, the enemy insists on fighting
  back.\nAnd now to keep with tradition, you're going to tell us why your war is just.\n.za\nIt
  is just!  We are fighting to regain what we once had.\n.wa\nWhat?\n.za\nKnowledge,
  knowledge that is rightly ours, but that is being kept from\nus by a group of primitive,
  backward tribesmen who now control the territory we\nseek.  It is we who have built
  this empire\nfrom dust.  It is we who have tamed the elements and made the laws
  of nature bend\nto our will.  We are the rightful inheritors of their knowledge.\n.cf\nWhat
  knowledge?  You've got your empire, what more do you need?\n.za\nA trivial thing:
  we need our enemies to serve us in ordering ourselves.\nWe have the technology,
  the damnable philosophers have the minds to\ndirect it to our ends.  It is such
  a small thing -- you cannot expect a\ngreat scientific mind to waste its time in
  absurd administrative and\norganizational details.  They must serve us...but they
  refuse.\n.wa\nSo you started a war.\n.za\nWe did not \"start\" the war...the war
  began.\n.cf\nWell, we aren't a part of it!\n.za\nThere are no neutrals in war.\n.sf

  who knows?  At least we can get out\nof here now and back to the Fallen Angel.\n.cf\nGet
