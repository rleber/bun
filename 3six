  IS THAT IT IS RUN ENTIRELY LIKE THE GONG SHOW.)\n\n.aa EMCEE\nWelcome to the show
  tonight, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the\nKing Kong show where you go ape over
  your favourite contestant.\nRemember last week when Morgo the Friendly Brickman
  sang\nhis way into your hearts with Gorilla My Dreams; and here's the host of your\nshow
  K. K. Kong...\n\n(ENTER KONG WITH CASSETTE RECORDER UNDER HIS ARM. HE TURNS ON A\nLAUGH
  TRACK OF CHEERS AND RECORDED APPLAUSE)\n\n.aa KONG\nGood evening, good evening,
  thank you all, oh they love me, what can I say -\n(HE TURNS OFF THE LAUGH TRACK
  ABRUPTLY).\nAnd we have a great show tonight folks, let me tell you.  But first
  let's\nintroduce our panel.\n\n(MAN WALKS ON AND OFF WITH A PIECE OF PANELLING)\n\nIsn't
  that great? And we didn't even have to beam it here.\nAnd stay tuned for next week,
  when we bring in the Board of\nEntertainment. (TURNS ON LAUGH TRACK, STOPS IT).\nGreat
  stuff, they love me.\nAnd for our first act, we have Marshall Arts who will break
  the silence with\nhis bare hands.\nGive him a hand, folks, let's here it for Marshall
  Arts. (FARTING SOUND)\nArts, folks, arts.\n\n(ENTER MARSHALL ARTS. HE TRIES TO CLAP
  HIS HANDS TWICE AND FAILS. ON\nTHE THIRD TRY HE IS GONGED JUST AS HIS HANDS MEET)\n\nOh,
  too bad there, Marshall, you got the old gong.\nWell, I can't understand that, I
  loved you.\n\n.aa MARSHALL\nI thought you said that was our secret.\n\n.aa KONG\nGreat
  little kidder there, isn't he, folks? (LAUGH TRACK)\nJust go offstage there, Marsh;
  you're\na gas.  Cement booties for him, boys.\nAnd next we have the great Dave McClell
  and his pet head, who will\namaze you all with his daring feats of somnambulance
  and acoustics.\n\n(DM PLAYS A SONG ON HIS HEAD. GONG WITH THE WIND)\n\nOh too bad
  there, Dave old boy.  You tried this once before, I recall.\nOh, you don't like
  that word?  Well, I won't petition you to stay any longer,\nDave, signature a very
  busy man.\nAnd now folks we've got a real treat for you, the Bay City Reefers will\n.ul\nnot\nplay
  tonight because their act went up in smoke. (LAUGH TRACK)\nInstead, we bring you,
  for the first time on any stage, live or\notherwise, from L. A. to New York, from

  FED1\nThis is what we should be reading - Roberts Rules of Order.\n\n.aa FED2\nWe've
  been hearing enough of that as it is.\n\n.aa FED4\nMaybe we should have some rubber
  rules of order so we can bend them as\nmuch as we want.\n\n.aa FED3\nI move we check

  what does wearing a garter belt have to do\nwith being here?\n\n.aa KONG\nThis is
  the King Kong show (LAUGH TRACK) and we were expecting a poodle\nin a garter belt.
  Well, maybe not a poodle's garter belt, but a \nmad dog's dildo anyway.\n\n.ga\nAll
  I'm trying to do is find the true page for the Winkle.\n\n.aa KONG\nWell, why didn't
  you say so in the first place?\nHave we got a page for him, folks. (LAUGH TRACK)

  long time ago,\nI can still remember \nhow the paper used to make me cry;\nAnd I
  knew if I had my way\nThey would publish what I say,\nAnd no one would dispute me
  for a while.\nBut last September made me quiver,\nwith each new issue I would shiver.\nFree
  news in the hallways,\nIt won't be like that always.\nThough some may pout and some
  may talk\nThe campus will forget this shock;\nThey'll soon forget who threw the
  rock\nThe day the chevron died.\n.fi\n.in -5\n\n.ga\nTo the Winkle...\n\n.aa FEDS\n.nf\n.in
